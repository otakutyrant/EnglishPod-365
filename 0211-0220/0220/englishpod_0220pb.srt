00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today we've got an intermediate level lesson for you.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you're interested in buying furniture for your house, you should like this lesson.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Exactly.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We are going to talk about a ton of different furniture items that you can get to decorate your house to make it all nice.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we're going to talk about a lot of vocabulary today.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Pay attention while you're listening to some of the pieces of furniture that we talk about.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We'll be back in a moment to talk more about them.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How about this floor lamp?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Fine.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Just get it.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We have been shopping for furniture for five hours.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm so tired.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We still need to find an armoire and a dresser.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Fine.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm going to go home and drop off this nightstand, coffee table, and love seat while you look for the rest of the things.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Great.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Pick me up in about an hour because I think I'll also get a bean bag and a dining set.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
While you're at it, can you pick up a nice recliner?

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I really want one so I can watch TV.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Recliner?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In my beautifully decorated living room?

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't think so.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All right.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're back.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So now what we're going to do is, since we have so much vocab, we're in two parts.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So now let's go to Language Takeaway Part 1.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Language Takeaway Okay.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So everyone's heard of a lamp, a light.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is something that you use to read in the dark, for example, to see in the dark.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But in this case, we have a floor lamp.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Floor lamp.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So this is a lamp you put on the floor.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, exactly.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So usually this lamp would be a lot taller.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It'll maybe be like a meter taller, a meter and a half maybe.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So for example, in your living room next to your sofa, you might have a very tall floor lamp.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This allows you to get more light in the room.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Right.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So sometimes the center light in your living room is not enough.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You want maybe more light in the corners, you get a little floor lamp.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So that's the first item.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now that we go to the bedroom, we are getting an armoire.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
An armoire.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is kind of like a wardrobe.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a piece of furniture we use to keep clothes in, but usually they're hanging clothes.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So a closet is usually inside a wall, right?

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Right.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So a closet's a part of your house.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's not furniture.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Right.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So an armoire is the same as a closet, but it's not in the house, like in the walls.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's outside.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a piece of furniture.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a big box.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I could pick it up and move it.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So an armoire is a tall place to keep clothing.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Usually you hang your clothes.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You hang your shirts and your dresses and your coats.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And moving on, we have a dresser.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Now this seems pretty straightforward.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
To get dressed, you have a dresser.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It makes a lot of sense, but there is a big difference here between an armoire and a dresser.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
A dresser is usually drawers.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Ah.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So you keep your sweaters, your shirts, your socks, your underwear in a dresser.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay.

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So an armoire, as you said, usually you hang your shirts or your pants.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's for hanging stuff only.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
A dresser is you have different drawers where you can put your socks, your boxer shorts, and any other things that you keep.

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay.

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Very good.

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So two very handy words, and that's what makes the difference between a closet.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So many people say, oh, well, it's just a closet.

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, a closet's different.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, a closet is actually part of your house.

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's a part of the wall.

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Maybe it has a door.

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And yeah, there's a big difference there.

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So moving on, we have a nightstand that's also usually in the bedroom.

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's right.

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So I always wondered, why is it called a nightstand and not a daystand?

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, a nightstand, it makes sense.

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It usually has a lamp on it, a light on it.

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And so when you're in bed and you want to read, you have a nightstand next to you to put your lamp so you can turn the lamp on.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Usually I also keep my books here.

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So when I'm reading, I put my books down, then I go to sleep.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Some people also keep their glasses and their alarm clock on a nightstand.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a small table that stands next to your bed.

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Very good.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And our last word for language takeaway, part one, we have a coffee table.

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay.

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So with the coffee table, Marco, we're moving back into the living room.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And in the living room, you have a sofa, you have some chairs, you need a table, but you don't want a big table.

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You want a small table or a very short table.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is a coffee table.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's called a coffee table.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm not really sure why.

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I guess because if you're having coffee in the living room, this is where you put the coffee.

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's right.

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And we even have something called coffee table books.

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
These are big, beautiful books, hardback books that have many pictures that you put on your coffee table to look nice.

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's not for you to actually to read all the time.

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I read them, but it's more important to use these books to look nice.

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And this is interesting, though, because in many other countries, they're not really called a coffee table.

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So a direct translation wouldn't really help you in many cases.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Like I know, I think in Chinese, it's called a tea table, not a coffee table.

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That makes sense.

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Right.

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Like I know in Spanish, it's just called a center table.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So this is basically the low table you have in your living room next to your sofa, in front of your sofa, actually.

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So you can you can have tea or coffee and read books or put your feet up while you're watching TV.

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Not in my house.

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
All right.

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So now why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll return in a little bit with more vocab.

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How about this floor lamp?

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Fine, just get it.

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We have been shopping for furniture for five hours.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm so tired.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We still need to find an armoire and a dresser.

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Fine.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm going to go home and drop off this nice thin coffee table and loveseat while you look for the rest of the things.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Great.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Pick me up in about an hour because I think I'll also get a beanbag and a dining set.

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
While you're at it.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Can you pick up a nice recliner?

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I really want one so I can watch TV recliner in my beautifully decorated living room.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't think so.

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All right, we're back.

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So now let's take a look at Language Takeaway, part two.

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Coming up, we have one of my favorite phrases in the English language.

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't know why I like it so much, but it is a great name for a piece of furniture.

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
A loveseat.

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Loveseat.

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
OK, OK.

151
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It sounds very romantic.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It does.

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, think about a sofa.

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
A sofa can be very large.

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can have four or five people on a sofa.

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Right.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But a loveseat is a small sofa for two people.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
OK, so that's what makes the difference, right?

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's a sofa, but only two people can sit on this.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's right.

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So if it's a big sofa, it's not a loveseat.

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And what about if it's one?

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Because usually a sofa sets, you have a loveseat, a big one, and you have one, sometimes an individual one.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Do you just call it a chair?

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yep, a chair.

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
A chair.

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Exactly.

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We'll come to it in a minute.

169
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There's a special kind of chair that it might be, but we're not quite there yet.

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
First, we have another kind of chair, which is very special and reminds me a lot of the 1970s.

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Right, we have a bean bag, and this is actually a piece of furniture that's still very popular in many places.

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And it's called a bean bag because it's a huge bag that is filled with beans.

173
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Right, beans or something soft.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And when you sit on it, it looks like a ball, but when you sit on it, it can change shape.

175
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Right, it molds to what shape you are.

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And usually they're very light.

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And a lot of times, I hate to say it, a lot of times bachelor's apartments have these.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's right, it's actually a very cheap piece of furniture, and it's comfortable sometimes.

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If you're watching TV, you can just sit on your bean bag and watch TV.

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Even I know some people may, you know, fall asleep on a bean bag as guests.

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I've never slept on, well maybe once, but I don't remember sleeping on a bean bag.

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I imagine it's quite uncomfortable.

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, if you're back.

184
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But moving on after a bean bag, which is a good informal piece of furniture, we have a dining set, which is a lot nicer.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay, dining set.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All right, so a dining set has many pieces.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You have a dining room table.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Right.

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You have chairs.

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So a set is basically a collection of a table and chairs together.

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Sometimes I think it will also include some type of piece of furniture that's next to the dining table where you can keep your plates and you can keep your teacups and all that.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What's that called?

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's called a buffet.

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And that's basically, it's like a dresser for your dining room.

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Right, exactly.

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's got like drawers and stuff for your plates, your cups, like you said, and it's next to the dining room table.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But the dining room set or the dining set is for the dining room.

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's the table where you eat dinner.

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, very good.

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And now moving on to that special chair that I am a big fan of.

201
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's very comfortable to sit on, and it's called a recliner.

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Recliner.

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So we have a word here, recline.

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It means to lie back, put your head back, to get comfortable.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So a recliner is a chair that you can change the shape of to make you lie down flat.

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So you know, when you sit down, you're sitting, but what if you want to lie down in a chair?

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This chair lets you do that.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And it also, from the bottom part where your feet are, a little thing pops up so you can rest your feet on top of this little extension of the chair.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay, so it has a built-in footrest.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Footrest, exactly.

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So it's very comfortable.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's very popular.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If you ever watched the series Friends, they have the recliners.

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's very comfortable to watch sports, for example.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You have your beer.

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Joey has his recliner.

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And remember when Joey and Chandler lived together, they have the two recliners in front of the TV.

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Those chairs are recliners, and they're very, very popular.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Actually, I think in the United States, they're very commonly known by the brand La-Z-Boy.

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's right.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There's a brand.

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's not a kind of furniture, but it's the name of the brand.

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's La-Z-Boy, and they're very, very famous.

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're right, Marco, for their reclining chairs.

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Exactly.

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So La-Z-Boy, you may hear it, but the real word for it is called a recliner.

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So a lot of interesting pieces of furniture there.

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I think our house is going to look amazing.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue one last time?

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
How about this floor lamp?

231
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Fine.

232
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Just get it.

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We have been shopping for furniture for five hours.

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm so tired.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We still need to find an armoire and a dresser.

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Fine.

237
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm going to go home and drop off this nightstand, coffee table, and love seat while you look for the rest of the things.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Great.

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Pick me up in about an hour, because I think I'll also get a beanbag and a dining set.

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
While you're at it, can you pick up a nice recliner?

241
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I really want one so I can watch TV.

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Recliner?

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
In my beautifully decorated living room?

244
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't think so.

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
All right.

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We're back.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So talking about furniture, it's very interesting.

248
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
How do you take it home?

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What do you do?

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And in this case, they were transporting it themselves.

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And the guy said, I'm going to go home and drop off this nightstand, coffee table, and love seat.

252
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So to drop off.

253
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay.

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is a great verb.

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
To drop off.

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's a verbal phrase.

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So the preposition there is off, not on.

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So I could say, for example, Marco, I'm just going to drop off my bag at home, and then I'll meet you guys for dinner.

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That means I'm going to go to my house and put down my bag, and then I'll leave.

260
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So to drop off is basically to go somewhere so you can put something in that place.

261
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But it doesn't mean that you're going to go to that place and stay there.

262
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Right.

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So if I say I'm going to drop off the kids at school, that means I'm going to take the kids and leave them at school and then go away.

264
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It doesn't mean you're going to school yourself.

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So can you drop off the laundry at the dry cleaners, please?

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Very good.

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So I'm going to take the laundry to the dry cleaners, leave it there, and then go somewhere else.

268
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So what happens at three o'clock when the kids are still at school?

269
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's right.

270
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Now we use the opposite verbal phrase, and that is to pick up.

271
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Okay.

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Drop off, pick up.

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So you go pick up the kids.

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You go pick up the laundry.

275
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So this isn't just about picking something up from a table or the ground.

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can actually use your car to pick something up.

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Right.

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You go and retrieve it.

279
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So I'm going to the post office to pick up my package.

280
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Very good.

281
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So phrases that you're going to have to use if you're talking about furniture, if you're talking about buying something.

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And while we're on the topic, I know that one of the most popular places to buy furniture is IKEA.

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Are you a big fan of IKEA?

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I like IKEA, and I love what they've done for people who don't want to spend too much money on furniture.

285
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Furniture is expensive.

286
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Furniture is very expensive.

287
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You can spend $5,000 on a sofa.

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And so IKEA is a wonderful brand and I think a wonderful company because it makes good looking furniture affordable.

289
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And it's because you put it together yourself, right?

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's right.

291
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
A lot of things you have to assemble or put together by yourself.

292
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So you buy it in a box and then you make it.

293
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And it's a little bit frustrating sometimes, but for people like me, and I'm sure people like you, it's part of the fun is putting stuff together.

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, because you kind of feel like you kind of built it, but you really didn't.

295
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So it kind of gives you that false sense of accomplishment.

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's like I'm in the 19th century and I can make my own furniture.

297
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So it's very popular.

298
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I've actually, and apart from having great furniture, I understand that they have amazing meatballs.

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They do.

300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, I'm Swedish.

301
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I never get to eat Swedish meatballs.

302
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And here in China, they do have some of the better meatballs around.

303
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So I would recommend if you haven't tried them, try them.

304
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
They're pretty good.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, go to IKEA.

306
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Go to IKEA, have some dinner.

307
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Let me know.

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Do you like IKEA and do you love their meatballs?

310
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,000
All right.

311
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We'll see you guys there.

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Bye.
