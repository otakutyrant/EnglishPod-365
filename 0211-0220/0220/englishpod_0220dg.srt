00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com How about this floor lamp?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Fine.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Just get it.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have been shopping for furniture for five hours.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm so tired.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We still need to find an armoire and a dresser.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Fine.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm going to go home and drop off this nightstand, coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Great.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Pick me up in about an hour because I think I'll also get a bean bag and a dining set.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
While you're at it, can you pick up a nice recliner?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I really want one so I can watch TV.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Recliner?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In my beautifully decorated living room?

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't think so.
