00:00:01,739 --> 00:00:07,080
EnglishPod.com How about this floor lamp?

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:07,919
Fine.

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:08,640
Just get it.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,939
We have been shopping for furniture for five hours.

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm so tired.

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,080
We still need to find an armoire and a dresser.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:15,660
Fine.

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:21,320
I'm going to go home and drop off this nightstand, coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things.

9
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:22,160
Great.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,000
Pick me up in about an hour because I think I'll also get a bean bag and a dining set.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,379
While you're at it, can you pick up a nice recliner?

12
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,500
I really want one so I can watch TV.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,420
Recliner?

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,420
In my beautifully decorated living room?

15
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:38,920
I don't think so.
