EnglishPod.com Honey, we're all out of wine and cheese.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Can't wait.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm watching the game right now.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things.

Fine.

Also, get some coleslaw and a jar of olives.

12

Whoa, wait a minute.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Isn't that a bit too much?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I mean, how much is all this going to cost?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Never mind that.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Is that all, your majesty?

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Very funny.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Get a move on.

23
