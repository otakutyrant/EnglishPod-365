EnglishPod.com Honey, we're all out of wine and cheese.

00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,960
Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things?

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,099
Can't wait.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,859
I'm watching the game right now.

5

Isn't that a bit too much?

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,259

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,679
Never mind that.

00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,179
Very funny.

22
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,219
Get a move on.
