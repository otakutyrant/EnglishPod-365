00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Kathryn, and today we're talking about one of our favorite topics here at EnglishPod.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That would be food.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We love talking about food, and this time we are going to pick up some food at the deli.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's a deli?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A deli is a special store where a person can buy meats.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Meat and cheese.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In this case, we're talking about special meats.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's not just pork or beef, which you could also buy at the butcher.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It is cured meats, cold meats.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's take a look at today's vocabulary preview to find out more about this special kind of meat.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
All right, so at the deli, you usually pick up cold cuts.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Cold cuts.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Basically, the way that I used to remember cold cuts as a child was that cold cuts are what you put on a sandwich.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So sliced turkey, sliced chicken.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Ham.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Salami.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
OK.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Like pepperoni would be a cold cut, right?

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's right.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So cold cuts are meats that you serve cold normally.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They're usually cured.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They're not like raw pork or raw beef.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You put them on a sandwich.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So cured meats would be like that they're smoked.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
They're not cooked.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No, they're not cooked.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're right.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
They're smoked or they're cured with a kind of chemical or brine.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That means that they're preserved.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They can last for a long time.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All right.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Very good.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So that's what we're getting at the deli.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Usually at the deli, you can pick up meats, cheeses and pickles and all that.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
All that good stuff.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
All right.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So why don't we jump into our dialogue and listen to it for the first time.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Honey, we're all out of wine and cheese.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things?

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Can't wait.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm watching the game right now.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Fine.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What do you need?

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Pick up some cured meats to go with the wine.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Maybe a pound of Polish sausages, ham, liverwurst, salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think I saw a promotion for pastrami.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Also get some coleslaw and a jar of olives.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Whoa.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Wait a minute.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Isn't that a bit too much?

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I mean, how much is all this going to cost?

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Nevermind that.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Get some dips as well.

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dips and also some satsiki.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If they have bean dip, get that as well.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Last but not least, get some pickles.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is that all your majesty?

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Very funny.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Get a move on.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
People will be here any minute.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
All right.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We're back.

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So now we're going to go into language takeaway where we're going to take a look at six keywords.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Language takeaway.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All right.

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So the first keyword that we have, we actually talked about it already, but just to make sure that you got it, those are cured meats.

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Cured meats.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, to cure something is to preserve it in this case.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So be careful because to cure has a couple of different meanings.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But when we're talking about food, something that is cured is preserved.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
For example, pickles are cured in salty water.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Brine.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, is that what it's called?

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Brine?

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Salty water.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No wonder I don't like pickles.

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But pickles are like, if you don't put them in brine, they don't taste all soury and nasty.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No, that's because they're cucumbers.

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So a cucumber becomes a pickle after it's been cured.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So we could talk about pork, but when pork is cured, it becomes ham.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Awesome.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So cured meats are meats that have been preserved through some kind of process like using salt or drying them.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Awesome.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And one of these cured meats, I think maybe is a liverwurst.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, this is a German lesson now, not just an English lesson.

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
In English, we have a lot of words that come from German.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And one of these words is wurst.

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And that means sausage, right?

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right.

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sausage.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So bratwurst, liverwurst.

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And in this case, liverwurst, I'm sure you can guess what part of the pig that comes from.

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Liver.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Very good, Marco.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You get a star for the day.

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, no, liverwurst is a kind of sausage that's made up of this part of the animal.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay.

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Actually, I've never...

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know if I've had liverwurst.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What does it look like?

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is it white?

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Is it red?

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Is it...

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I think it's like...

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Light, purplish, whitish.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't know.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've had bloodwurst.

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's good.

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, blood sausage is delicious.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And well, apart from picking up meats and cheeses at the deli, you can also pick up coleslaw.

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All right.

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Coleslaw is an American classic.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sure you could get this other places as well, though.

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's basically a cold salad that's made up of cabbage and carrots and maybe onions.

125
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But generally, the sauce is white.

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's like a mayonnaise and vinegar sauce.

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So it's very stringy, lots of thin, long pieces.

128
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And the sauce is white.

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, I think this is a very American thing.

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm not really sure if I've seen coleslaw in many other places.

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But I personally don't like it.

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Again, because of the whole vinegar thing, I'm not a big fan of the bitter stuff.

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah, I love...

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We also call it slaw, sometimes with a side of slaw.

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I love a hot dog with a side of coleslaw.

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, really?

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
One of my favorite meals.

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, wow.

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

141
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So coleslaw.

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Moving on, we have an interesting sauce.

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's Greek, I believe.

144
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That is correct.

145
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And I'm not gonna try to pronounce it, because I might mess it up, so I'm gonna leave that one to you.

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, I don't speak Greek, but this is how we say it in America.

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Tzatziki.

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Tzatziki.

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Tzatziki is a food that comes from Greece, like you said.

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You know, in America, we have a lot of different foods in Europe, too, wherever.

152
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
People come from all over the place.

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And in America, we've adopted a number of foods.

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
One of these foods is tzatziki.

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's a white yogurt dip.

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So usually in tzatziki, there is some onion, some cucumber, some pepper, but it's a really good, thick, creamy yogurt dip that you use with bread or chips.

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And that's actually our next word.

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You mentioned it's a dip.

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So you're using that as a noun, and that's our next word.

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Dip.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Dip.

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So basically, a dip is a kind of food that you eat with other foods.

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

165
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So it's like a sauce.

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Exactly.

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a sauce for finger foods.

168
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So basically, a dip is a food you eat with other foods.

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So you can have chips and dip.

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That would be potato chips with dip.

171
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And sometimes you have tomato dip or cheese dip.

172
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
In this case, we have tzatziki or blue cheese dip.

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Blue cheese dip.

174
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay.

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But actually, it's also a verb, right?

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
To dip.

177
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So when you take your potato chip and you dip it in the dip, you can say that.

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

179
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Dip it in the dip.

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay.

181
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So you dip your potato chip in the dip.

182
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes.

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Very good.

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So those are all the words that we have for you today on Language Takeaway.

185
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

186
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Honey, we're all out of wine and cheese.

187
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things?

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Can't wait.

189
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm watching the game right now.

190
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Your friends and family are coming over tonight, and we still need to get a lot of things.

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Fine.

192
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What do you need?

193
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Pick up some cured meats to go with the wine.

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Maybe a pound of Polish sausages, ham, liverwurst, salami, and any other cold cuts that are on sale.

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I think I saw a promotion for pastrami.

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Also, get some coleslaw and a jar of olives.

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Whoa.

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Wait a minute.

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Isn't that a bit too much?

201
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I mean, how much is all this going to cost?

202
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Never mind that.

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Get some dips as well.

204
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dips and also some satsiki.

205
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If they have bean dip, get that as well.

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Last but not least, get some pickles.

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Is that all, Your Majesty?

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Very funny.

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Get a move on.

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
People will be here any minute.

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,000
All right.

212
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We're back.

213
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

214
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Fluency Builder.

215
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This first one is a very, very common phrase.

216
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We use this a lot in English when we're maybe running late or you need something very quickly.

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We say, hey, can you run to the store and get this?

218
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Or do you mind running to the deli?

219
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So the verb here is to run to.

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Run to.

221
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Run to the deli.

222
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Now, does this mean that you're actually going to walk very fast to the deli, you're going to run?

223
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No, this is not literal.

224
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
This is not, okay, I'm going to go to the deli and I'm going to get some food.

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No, this is going quickly.

226
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay.

227
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So I could say, Marco, I have no time.

228
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Can you run to the store and get me some milk, please?

229
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay, so that means just go really quickly in your car, your motorcycle, any way you can.

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Or walking, yeah, exactly.

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Good.

232
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So that's run to the store, run to the deli.

233
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
In this case, we saw it in the sentence, do you mind running to the deli?

234
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So do you mind going quickly?

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So this is going quickly.

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Do you mind running to the deli?

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This is a thing that we can do.

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

239
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And so she was telling him what to get and he's like, whoa, this is going to be really expensive and she answered with this phrase, never mind that.

240
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Never mind that.

241
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay, this is a phrase that we use when we want to say, don't worry about it.

242
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That doesn't matter.

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No problem.

244
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's not important.

245
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So a never mind, you could say by itself, never mind, forget about it.

246
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But never mind that is like saying, this argument is over, it's not a problem.

247
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So never mind that.

248
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
As I was saying, let's go to the store.

249
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay, good.

250
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So it's not important, it's not relevant, don't worry about it.

251
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Very good.

252
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And the last phrase that we have for you is a very interesting phrase when the girl said, you know what, very funny, but get a move on.

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
People will be here any minute.

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Get a move on.

255
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Get a move on.

256
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So as we often say here at EnglishPod, this is the kind of phrase we have to look at as a chunk, as a unit, as one piece.

257
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You could say get, get me this, or I move, I moved my house, but get a move on means hurry up.

258
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hurry up.

259
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Start leaving now, go, go to the store, be quick about it.

260
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So this is a command.

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Get a move on.

262
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Okay, so take it as a phrase, just like you know the phrase hurry up or go quickly, remember the phrase get a move on as a way of saying come on, quickly, go, go, go, quickly.

263
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That's right.

264
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Or as I always say when I'm with friends and we're going slowly somewhere, I say, hey guys, let's get a move on.

265
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's get a move on.

266
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They're going to close.

267
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's get going.

268
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Let's go here.

269
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay, very good.

270
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So get a move on.

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Let's get a move on and why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for one last time.

272
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Honey, we're all out of wine and cheese.

273
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things?

274
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Can it wait?

275
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm watching the game right now.

276
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things.

277
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Fine.

278
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What do you need?

279
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay, pick up some cured meats to go with the wine.

280
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Maybe a pound of Polish sausages, ham, liverwurst, salami, and any other cold cuts that are on sale.

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I think I saw a promotion for pastrami.

282
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Also, get some coleslaw and a jar of olives.

283
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Whoa, wait a minute.

284
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Isn't that a bit too much?

285
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I mean, how much is all this going to cost?

286
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Never mind that.

287
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Get some dips as well.

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dips and also some satsiki.

289
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If they have bean dip, get that as well.

290
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Last but not least, get some pickles.

291
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Is that all, your majesty?

292
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Very funny.

293
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Get a move on.

294
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
People will be here any minute.

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
All right, we're back.

296
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So now, Catherine, I understand you're a big fan of pickles and olives and all that stuff.

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I love cured food.

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, really?

299
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Pickled...

300
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Have you ever had a pickled tomato?

301
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I hate pickled tomatoes.

302
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Pickled tomatoes, pickled pickles, pickled olives, everything.

303
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I love it all.

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I hate...

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I actually...

306
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
There are a couple of things that I don't really like.

307
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
For example, coleslaw, you mentioned that it has cabbage in it, and many people may know this vegetable as this purple lettuce, right?

308
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It looks like a lettuce, but it's purple.

309
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's right.

310
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I hate it.

311
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't like it.

312
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And I actually hate olives and pickles.

313
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I can't really eat them.

314
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Sounds like you don't like bitter things, like vinegar, olives.

315
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, no, not a big fan.

316
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Not a big fan of anything that's bitter.

317
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I love it.

318
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's one of my favorites.

319
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I love salty foods, and I love bitter foods, and that's all I have to say about it.

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I've never really understood how people have like a whole pickle, and they take it out of the jar and they just bite into it.

321
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's like...

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's nasty.

323
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Well, the adjective to describe a pickle's flavor is sour.

324
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's very sour.

325
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And in America, at delis, you can buy full sours or half sours.

326
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh, really?

327
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So some pickles are less sour than others.

328
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We call it a half sour.

329
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
My favorite pickles are full sours.

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Really?

331
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Make you cry a little bit.

332
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The whole pickle thing, is this very American?

333
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Because you always have pickles in burgers, for example, right?

334
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You go to McDonald's, you have pickles in burgers.

335
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Is this very American, or is this coming from another place?

336
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It comes from Europe.

337
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, really?

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
A lot of German food involves pickles, pickled vegetables.

339
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The Koreans also, Korean food has a lot of pickled vegetables, like kimchi, which is pickled cabbage.

340
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Ah, that's right.

341
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
In Chinese culture as well, a lot of pickled foods.

342
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So I think this is something that's very common all over the world.

343
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You can have pickled fish, pickled meats, yeah.

344
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You can pickle anything.

345
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't know if we pickle things in Latin America, this is why it seems very strange to me.

346
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But this is a really interesting topic, why don't you let us know what your favorite cured meats are.

347
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I know there are a lot of different types, and if you like pickles or not, maybe some people out there will support me and say they don't like pickles.

348
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
All right, and if you have delis in your home country, let us know.

349
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I've always been curious about this.

350
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Do you have delis, or do you just have a butcher shop?

351
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What's the difference?

352
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay, awesome.

353
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So we'll see everyone there, EnglishPod.com.

354
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Until next time.

355
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Bye everyone.

356
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Bye.
