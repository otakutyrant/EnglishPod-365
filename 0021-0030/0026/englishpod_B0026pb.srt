00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod Happy New Year.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Happy New Year.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Happy New Year, Marco.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's December 31st and we are on New Year's Eve.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And since it's New Year's Eve, we're talking about New Year's resolutions.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Right.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In many places, it's very common to make a promise for the New Year, something that you will change.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A promise to yourself.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
To yourself.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
To change something.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And that's what our dialogue is about today.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview for this lesson.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, on vocabulary preview today, we only have one word.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Eating habits.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Eating habits.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Eating habits.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So what are eating habits?

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The regular way you eat.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Right.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So if you eat healthy or if you eat lots of unhealthy food.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Or even maybe what time you eat, right?

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you eat every day at a certain time.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Eating habits.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So we're ready to listen to our dialogue today and it's going to be a little bit fast, but don't worry about it.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We'll come back and explain all of the key vocabulary after.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So did I tell you about my New Year's resolution?

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I've decided to go on a diet.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Exactly.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to cut out all the junk I eat.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No more chips.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No more soda.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No more fried food.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Uh-huh.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I've heard this one before.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But this time, I'm going to stick to it.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I really mean it.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Thanks, honey.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That was a great meal.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm stuffed.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Do we have any chips left?

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So, Marco, do you think this guy will be successful in changing his eating habits?

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, I guess he'll never change, but this gives us a great opportunity to look at some great vocabulary in this lesson in Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Our first word on Language Takeaway is junk.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Junk.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Junk.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Junk.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So, junk comes from junk food.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Exactly.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Unhealthy food.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Fries, chips.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hamburgers.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
All that junk.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
All that junk.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay, our second word for Language Takeaway, transform.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Transform.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Transform.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Meaning?

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
To change.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yep.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Change.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Mm-hmm.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So this guy is going to transform his eating habits.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He's going to change his eating habits.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Our third word is?

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Stuffed.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Stuffed.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Stuffed.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm stuffed.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So, we have some great examples on how we can use stuffed, and you'll get the meaning from it.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Example one.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Come on.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Have one more piece of cake.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, I can't.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm stuffed.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Example two.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, I ate way too much.

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm stuffed.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, I'm stuffed.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The feeling you get if you eat too much food.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Right.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm full.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So, these are some great words that you can use talking about food.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And eating habits.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And eating habits.

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And now we can listen to our dialogue a second time, and this time, like always, it's going to be slow.

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So, did I tell you about my New Year's resolution?

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I've decided to go on a diet.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Exactly.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm going to cut out all that junk I eat.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No more chips.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No more soda.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No more fried food.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Uh-huh.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I've heard this one before.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But this time, I'm going to stick to it.

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I really mean it.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Trust me, Carol.

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thanks, honey.

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That was a great meal.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm stuffed.

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do we have any chips left?

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There's a lot of great language in this dialogue, isn't there?

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah, a lot of great language that we can take a look at with our fluency builder.

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Fluency builder.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The first phrase we have for you is...

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Stick to it.

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Stick to it.

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Stick to it.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes, we've got some examples of how this phrase is used, so let's listen.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Example one.

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Quitting smoking is so hard.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Stick to it.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's good for you.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Example two.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can't solve this math problem.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Stick to it.

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sure you'll get it.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So stick to it, right?

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Basically means keep doing it.

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Right.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Even though English learning can be hard...

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You should stick to it.

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Stick to it.

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Exactly.

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, let's look at our second phrase for fluency builder.

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I mean it.

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mean it.

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mean it.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, this is a great way of saying...

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm serious.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm serious.

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I mean it.

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm not joking.

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm not joking, right?

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah.

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And our final phrase in fluency builder...

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Cut out.

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Cut out.

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Cut out.

156
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Again, we've got some examples of this phrase as native speakers use it.

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's listen.

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Example one.

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You have to cut out the salt from your diet.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No more chips.

161
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No more french fries.

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No more popcorn.

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Example two.

164
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's time for me to focus on my work.

165
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm going to cut out everything else from my life.

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay, so cut out means...

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
To remove.

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Completely remove.

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Take it away.

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Take it away.

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, some great language, some great phrases in our dialogue today.

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So, why don't we listen to it a third time and we'll come back in a little bit.

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So, did I tell you about my New Year's resolution?

175
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I've decided to go on a diet.

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Exactly.

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm going to cut out all the junk I eat.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
No more chips.

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No more soda.

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No more fried food.

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Uh-huh.

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I've heard this one before.

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But this time, I'm going to stick to it.

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I really mean it.

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Trust me, Carol.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

189
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thanks, honey.

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That was a great meal.

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm stuffed.

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Do we have any chips left?

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, so New Year's resolutions.

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
A really common and popular thing in North America.

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's tradition to make a promise to yourself on New Year's and stick to it throughout the whole year.

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But the funny thing is that very few people actually stick to their New Year's resolution.

197
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's true.

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The most common ones are, I'm going to quit smoking.

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah?

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That never happens.

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm going to go on a diet.

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Like this guy?

204
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm going to quit drinking.

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Uh-huh.

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That almost never happens either.

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
On New Year's Eve, you start drinking.

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's a bad time.

209
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Come on.

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And another really common one is, I'm going to join a gym.

211
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's why gym membership sales are so high in January.

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Right.

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Everyone joins a gym in January, but...

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Come February.

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, and very few people in the gym.

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So Marco, do you have a New Year's resolution for this year?

217
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes, I have a New Year's resolution, and I resolve to continue bringing everyone some great lessons.

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh.

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's so good.

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And I think I can stick to that one.

221
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes.

222
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, I do hope that you do stick to that one, Marco.

223
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We will.

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We will.

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But today, we're out of time, so please go to our website and leave all your questions and comments.

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
At EnglishPod.com.

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And we'll see you there, but until then, it's...

228
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Bye.

229
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Bye.
