00:00:00,879 --> 00:00:04,440
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod Happy New Year.

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:05,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,379
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:07,540
Happy New Year.

5
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:08,619
Happy New Year, Marco.

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,539
It's December 31st and we are on New Year's Eve.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,400
That's right.

8
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,059
And since it's New Year's Eve, we're talking about New Year's resolutions.

9
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:20,179
Right.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,519
In many places, it's very common to make a promise for the New Year, something that you will change.

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,899
A promise to yourself.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,579
To yourself.

13
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,800
To change something.

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,120
And that's what our dialogue is about today.

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,679
So why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview for this lesson.

16
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:37,780
Vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,679
Okay, on vocabulary preview today, we only have one word.

18
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,000
Eating habits.

19
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,100
Eating habits.

20
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:44,960
Eating habits.

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,759
So what are eating habits?

22
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,939
The regular way you eat.

23
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,200
Right.

24
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:55,420
So if you eat healthy or if you eat lots of unhealthy food.

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,960
Or even maybe what time you eat, right?

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,060
If you eat every day at a certain time.

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,479
Eating habits.

28
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:01,979
Okay.

29
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,439
So we're ready to listen to our dialogue today and it's going to be a little bit fast, but don't worry about it.

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,980
We'll come back and explain all of the key vocabulary after.

31
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,000
So did I tell you about my New Year's resolution?

32
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,480
I've decided to go on a diet.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,379
And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

34
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:32,459
Exactly.

35
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,560
I'm going to cut out all the junk I eat.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,019
No more chips.

37
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,560
No more soda.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,640
No more fried food.

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,000
Uh-huh.

40
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,659
I've heard this one before.

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,700
But this time, I'm going to stick to it.

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,780
I really mean it.

43
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,280
Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,939
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,000
Thanks, honey.

46
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,939
That was a great meal.

47
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,319
I'm stuffed.

48
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,520
Do we have any chips left?

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,060
So, Marco, do you think this guy will be successful in changing his eating habits?

50
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:32,460
Well, I guess he'll never change, but this gives us a great opportunity to look at some great vocabulary in this lesson in Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,620
Our first word on Language Takeaway is junk.

52
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:40,520
Junk.

53
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,319
Junk.

54
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,060
Junk.

55
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,719
So, junk comes from junk food.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,319
Exactly.

57
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:47,840
Unhealthy food.

58
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:49,960
Fries, chips.

59
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,500
Hamburgers.

60
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,240
Yeah.

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,939
All that junk.

62
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:53,919
All that junk.

63
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,680
Okay, our second word for Language Takeaway, transform.

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,240
Transform.

65
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,659
Transform.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,300
Meaning?

67
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,379
To change.

68
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:03,759
Yep.

69
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,400
Change.

70
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:05,000
Mm-hmm.

71
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,939
So this guy is going to transform his eating habits.

72
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,759
He's going to change his eating habits.

73
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,060
Yeah.

74
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,699
Our third word is?

75
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:12,439
Stuffed.

76
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,759
Stuffed.

77
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:14,620
Stuffed.

78
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,560
I'm stuffed.

79
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:22,599
So, we have some great examples on how we can use stuffed, and you'll get the meaning from it.

80
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,139
Example one.

81
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,039
Come on.

82
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,960
Have one more piece of cake.

83
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,580
Oh, I can't.

84
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:32,840
I'm stuffed.

85
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,300
Example two.

86
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,020
Oh, I ate way too much.

87
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm stuffed.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,520
Okay, I'm stuffed.

89
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,419
The feeling you get if you eat too much food.

90
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:53,819
Right.

91
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:54,520
I'm full.

92
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,180
Yeah.

93
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,400
All right.

94
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,460
So, these are some great words that you can use talking about food.

95
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,419
And eating habits.

96
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,400
And eating habits.

97
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,780
And now we can listen to our dialogue a second time, and this time, like always, it's going to be slow.

98
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,879
So, did I tell you about my New Year's resolution?

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,920
I've decided to go on a diet.

100
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,800
And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

101
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,199
Exactly.

102
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,399
I'm going to cut out all that junk I eat.

103
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,980
No more chips.

104
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,600
No more soda.

105
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,060
No more fried food.

106
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,180
Uh-huh.

107
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,519
I've heard this one before.

108
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,839
But this time, I'm going to stick to it.

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,959
I really mean it.

110
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,180
Trust me, Carol.

111
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,740
I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

112
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,980
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

113
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,740
Thanks, honey.

114
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,579
That was a great meal.

115
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,019
I'm stuffed.

116
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,360
Do we have any chips left?

117
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,720
There's a lot of great language in this dialogue, isn't there?

118
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,079
Yeah, a lot of great language that we can take a look at with our fluency builder.

119
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:19,060
Fluency builder.

120
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,439
The first phrase we have for you is...

121
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:22,839
Stick to it.

122
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,040
Stick to it.

123
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,279
Stick to it.

124
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,600
Yes, we've got some examples of how this phrase is used, so let's listen.

125
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,680
Example one.

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,459
Quitting smoking is so hard.

127
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,100
Stick to it.

128
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,240
It's good for you.

129
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,699
Example two.

130
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,180
I can't solve this math problem.

131
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:55,420
Stick to it.

132
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,300
I'm sure you'll get it.

133
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,740
So stick to it, right?

134
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,319
Basically means keep doing it.

135
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:04,720
Right.

136
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,579
Even though English learning can be hard...

137
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:08,839
You should stick to it.

138
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,500
Stick to it.

139
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:09,959
Exactly.

140
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,420
Okay, let's look at our second phrase for fluency builder.

141
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,240
I mean it.

142
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:16,379
Mean it.

143
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,560
Mean it.

144
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,680
Well, this is a great way of saying...

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,399
I'm serious.

146
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,100
I'm serious.

147
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:21,519
Yeah.

148
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,180
I mean it.

149
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,019
I'm not joking.

150
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,339
I'm not joking, right?

151
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:24,879
Yeah.

152
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,199
And our final phrase in fluency builder...

153
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,740
Cut out.

154
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,180
Cut out.

155
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,519
Cut out.

156
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,319
Again, we've got some examples of this phrase as native speakers use it.

157
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,180
Let's listen.

158
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:38,959
Example one.

159
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,879
You have to cut out the salt from your diet.

160
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,019
No more chips.

161
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,399
No more french fries.

162
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,959
No more popcorn.

163
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,060
Example two.

164
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,680
It's time for me to focus on my work.

165
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,699
I'm going to cut out everything else from my life.

166
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,660
Okay, so cut out means...

167
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,120
To remove.

168
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,420
Completely remove.

169
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,199
Take it away.

170
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:08,899
Take it away.

171
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,279
Yeah.

172
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:13,600
Okay, some great language, some great phrases in our dialogue today.

173
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:18,519
So, why don't we listen to it a third time and we'll come back in a little bit.

174
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,259
So, did I tell you about my New Year's resolution?

175
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:31,759
I've decided to go on a diet.

176
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,639
And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

177
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,800
Exactly.

178
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm going to cut out all the junk I eat.

179
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:42,300
No more chips.

180
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:43,839
No more soda.

181
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,920
No more fried food.

182
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,259
Uh-huh.

183
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:48,920
I've heard this one before.

184
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:51,980
But this time, I'm going to stick to it.

185
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,779
I really mean it.

186
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,240
Trust me, Carol.

187
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,600
I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

188
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

189
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,279
Thanks, honey.

190
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,199
That was a great meal.

191
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,600
I'm stuffed.

192
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:17,800
Do we have any chips left?

193
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,779
Okay, so New Year's resolutions.

194
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:29,620
A really common and popular thing in North America.

195
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,320
It's tradition to make a promise to yourself on New Year's and stick to it throughout the whole year.

196
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,340
But the funny thing is that very few people actually stick to their New Year's resolution.

197
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,159
That's true.

198
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,279
The most common ones are, I'm going to quit smoking.

199
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:45,840
Yeah?

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,799
That never happens.

201
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,220
No.

202
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,360
I'm going to go on a diet.

203
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:50,720
Like this guy?

204
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:52,620
I'm going to quit drinking.

205
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,340
Uh-huh.

206
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,059
That almost never happens either.

207
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:56,580
On New Year's Eve, you start drinking.

208
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,419
It's a bad time.

209
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,159
Come on.

210
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:03,639
And another really common one is, I'm going to join a gym.

211
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,320
That's why gym membership sales are so high in January.

212
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:08,799
Right.

213
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,639
Everyone joins a gym in January, but...

214
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,220
Come February.

215
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,360
Yeah, and very few people in the gym.

216
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,419
So Marco, do you have a New Year's resolution for this year?

217
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:24,759
Yes, I have a New Year's resolution, and I resolve to continue bringing everyone some great lessons.

218
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,600
Oh.

219
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:27,200
That's so good.

220
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,860
And I think I can stick to that one.

221
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:29,120
Yes.

222
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,720
Well, I do hope that you do stick to that one, Marco.

223
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,419
We will.

224
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:32,799
We will.

225
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:38,000
But today, we're out of time, so please go to our website and leave all your questions and comments.

226
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,580
At EnglishPod.com.

227
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:42,799
And we'll see you there, but until then, it's...

228
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:43,639
Bye.

229
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:43,919
Bye.
