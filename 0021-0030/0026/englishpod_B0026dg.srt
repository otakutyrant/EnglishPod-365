1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:12,339
So, did I tell you about my New Year's resolution?

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
I've decided to go on a diet.

3
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,739
And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

4
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:20,859
Exactly.

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,940
I'm going to cut out all the junk I eat.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,019
No more chips, no more soda, no more fried food.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,039
Uh-huh, I've heard this one before.

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,079
But this time, I'm going to stick to it.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,140
I really mean it.

10
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,619
Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

11
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:44,659
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,359
Thanks, honey.

13
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,299
That was a great meal.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,679
I'm stuffed.

15
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,899
Do we have any chips left?
