00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
EnglishPod.com Dad, I'd like to borrow some money.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Sure, Johnny.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
How much do you need?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Five bucks?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Come on, Dad.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I need thirty thousand.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I want to get into the market.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I look at this as an opportunity.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I don't know about that.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
With all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't know if you're aware, son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact upon the economy.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There's just too much instability.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I just wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But look at it this way.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Every challenge is an opportunity.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There are emerging markets that promise great returns.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Look at China, for example.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
They have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth-generating opportunity.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Aw, come on, son.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're looking at this too naively.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Fine, then.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If that's the way you feel, so be it.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But you're losing out on a great opportunity here.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm gonna hit up Mom for the cash.
