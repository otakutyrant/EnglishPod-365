Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're bringing you an advanced lesson today.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
An advanced lesson where we talk about investing in emerging markets.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Right.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So it's kind of a business topic.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's kind of a world topic as well.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And it's pretty difficult.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, it is really hard.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Right.

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So if you're listening and you don't understand everything, please don't get discouraged.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Just don't worry about it because we're here to learn.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And we're here to help you.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Right.

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So let's get started with this.

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm really excited about this lesson.

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay.

22
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, Marco, maybe you can tell us a little bit.

23
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What is an emerging market?

24
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
An emerging market is a market that is starting to develop.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay.

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And it's growing rapidly.

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So you can maybe give some examples of emerging market.

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, for example, China is an emerging market.

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah.

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In the last years, it's been growing rapidly.

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
More and more people are moving to the middle class and have money to spend.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Exactly.

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So China is like a really great example of an emerging market.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
All right.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, with that, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dad, I'd like to borrow some money.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sure, Johnny.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How much do you need?

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Five bucks?

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Come on, Dad.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I need 30,000.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I want to get into the market.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I look at this as an opportunity.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is a chance for me to get a jumpstart on building my nest egg.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know about that.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
With all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know if you're aware, son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact upon the economy.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There's just too much instability.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I just wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But look at it this way.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Every challenge is an opportunity.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market.

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There are emerging markets that promise great returns.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Look at China, for example.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
They have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth-generating opportunity.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, come on, son.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And you're looking at this too, naively.

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Fine, then.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If that's the way you feel, so be it.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But you're losing out on a great opportunity here.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm going to hit up mom for the cash.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, it sounds like the dad has missed out on a really big investment opportunity, hey?

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, and his son is pretty smart.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Pretty smart little boy.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
OK, so we have some great words that we want to look at here.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why don't we start with the first one?

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Turmoil.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Turmoil.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Turmoil.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So we have some great examples of how turmoil is used in different sentences, so let's listen.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Example one.

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
With a civil war, a famine, and inflation, the country has been in turmoil for 10 years.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Example two.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There's been a lot of turmoil in my life recently, but I've moved to a new city, I've changed my job, I broke up with my girlfriend.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Example three.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The devaluation of the dollar caused a great deal of turmoil in the markets.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So turmoil is a state of uncertainty, of change, of difficult times, a little bit of chaos.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So, for example, when there's a lot of turmoil in the market, that means stock prices are changing drastically from day to day.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Or the economies in turmoil, there's a lot of problems going on.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, uncertainty.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Uncertainty.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
OK, good word.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
All right.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And we also saw something really interesting in the dialogue about a proposed stimulus package.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A proposed stimulus package.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So a proposed stimulus package is something that's going on now.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's break this phrase down.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So we've got stimulus package.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
A stimulus package, something to stimulate the economy, right?

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Right.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So money from the government to get the economy moving.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
To get it moving.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Stimulus package.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Proposed.

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It means that it hasn't been approved yet.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's suggested.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's suggested.

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's an idea.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So the proposed stimulus package for the U.S.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
economy, for example, is $150 billion.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Right.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's $150 billion of American taxpayers' money that the government wants to put into the economy to keep it moving.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
To keep it moving, right.

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So if it works or not, that's still a debate, but it's a proposed stimulus package.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's move to our third phrase.

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Aggregate demand.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Aggregate demand.

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Aggregate demand.

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Aggregate demand.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So demand is pretty clear, but this word aggregate, what's that about?

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Aggregate is like a combined, added, right?

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Aggregate demand.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:46,000
For example, in a country like China, where cities like in Shanghai or cities like Beijing, where more and more people are accumulating wealth, the aggregate demand is increasing.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Right, right.

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The combined demand for consumer goods is growing.

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Right.

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
More people have more money, so they're spending more.

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You know, Marco, there's a ton of excellent language in this dialogue, isn't there?

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah.

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A lot of good stuff here.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah.

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And we want to listen to the dialogue one more time.

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But before we do, we have three words for you that we want you to listen for.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah.

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Pay attention to these words.

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Nest egg.

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Nest egg.

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Inevitable.

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Inevitable.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And hit up.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hit up.

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So, from the context of the dialogue, try and see if you can figure out what they mean.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But after listening to it, we'll come back and explain it anyways.

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Dad, I'd like to borrow some money.

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Sure, Johnny.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
How much do you need?

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Five bucks?

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Come on, Dad.

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I need thirty thousand.

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I want to get into the market.

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses.

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I look at this as an opportunity.

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is a chance for me to get a jumpstart on building my nest egg.

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't know about that.

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
With all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know if you're aware, son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact upon the economy.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There's just too much instability.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I just wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But look at it this way.

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Every challenge is an opportunity.

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market.

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There are emerging markets that promise great returns.

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Look at China, for example.

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class.

164
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth-generating opportunity.

165
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Aw, come on, son, you're looking at this too naively.

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Fine, then.

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If that's the way you feel, so be it.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But you're losing out on a great opportunity here.

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm gonna hit up mom for the cash.

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So the kid wants to invest because he wants to set up his nest egg.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's right.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So basically, he wants to get a bunch of cash together so that he can buy a house or get married or whatever.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's that money you need to start your life, right?

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
To start your life, your nest egg.

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's kind of a weird way of referring to this money, right?

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I guess it is kind of funny.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And also, the little boy talked about investing in the domestic market.

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Inevitable recession.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes, inevitable.

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Inevitable.

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Inevitable basically means unavoidable.

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So this guy thinks that the recession is unavoidable.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's gonna happen.

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes, inevitable.

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You know, this word inevitable, if you apply the root words, you can get a noun, an adjective, or an adverb, right?

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Right.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So we've got some examples where you can see this word in action.

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Example one.

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Jason knew he was going to get laid off, but he was trying to delay the inevitable.

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Example two.

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
As a new manager, it's inevitable that you're going to make mistakes.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Example three.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Inevitably, we all die at the end of our lives.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So as you can see, the noun and adjective form are the same.

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes, inevitable.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Inevitable.

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When we use it as an adverb, though, we add the ly to it.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Inevitably.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Inevitably.

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So yeah, as you can see, we could use it in many different ways depending on what we want to say.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Right.

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Well, inevitably, we have to move on to our third word.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hit up.

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hit up.

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So he says he's going to hit up mom for the cash.

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Ask his mom.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah, hit up.

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah, this is kind of a slangy term, isn't it?

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, it's more informal.

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
A lot more slangy.

213
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You wouldn't really use it with your boss, would you?

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No, you're not going to go up to your boss and say, hey, I need to hit you up for some cash.

216
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So Marco, I think this word is only applying to money, right?

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, you wouldn't go up to your boss and say, oh, I need to hit you up for some vacation time.

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No, it's typically used for money.

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
In this context.

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah.

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah.

222
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hit them up.

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We've got some examples of the phrase hit up.

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's listen.

225
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Example one.

226
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm going to hit up the boss for a raise.

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Example two.

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Are you trying to hit me up for money?

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Example three.

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't have any cash.

231
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Have you tried hitting up Sophie?

232
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
She's rich.

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay, so this is our first advanced lesson.

234
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I hope you enjoyed it.

235
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It is a lot more challenging, I think.

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Especially because it's set in a business context.

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So we have a lot of specific words and a lot of technical vocabulary.

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's right.

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Marco, you're exactly right.

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And I think that our users are going to have a lot of questions about the language in this lesson.

241
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So I'd like to invite you guys to come onto our website at EnglishPod.com.

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But until then, it's goodbye.

244
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Bye.
