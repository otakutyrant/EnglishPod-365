00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:04,719
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:05,839
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:06,799
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,720
We're bringing you an advanced lesson today.

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:10,599
That's right.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,119
An advanced lesson where we talk about investing in emerging markets.

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:14,660
Right.

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,859
So it's kind of a business topic.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,379
It's kind of a world topic as well.

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:19,899
Yes.

11
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,699
And it's pretty difficult.

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,960
Yeah, it is really hard.

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:23,679
Right.

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,079
So if you're listening and you don't understand everything, please don't get discouraged.

15
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,980
Just don't worry about it because we're here to learn.

16
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:31,399
Yes.

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,320
And we're here to help you.

18
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:32,780
Right.

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,500
So let's get started with this.

20
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,799
I'm really excited about this lesson.

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,439
Okay.

22
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,259
Well, Marco, maybe you can tell us a little bit.

23
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,039
What is an emerging market?

24
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,920
An emerging market is a market that is starting to develop.

25
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,399
Okay.

26
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,780
And it's growing rapidly.

27
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,740
So you can maybe give some examples of emerging market.

28
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:53,100
Well, for example, China is an emerging market.

29
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:53,479
Yeah.

30
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,799
In the last years, it's been growing rapidly.

31
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,340
More and more people are moving to the middle class and have money to spend.

32
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:00,460
Exactly.

33
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,659
So China is like a really great example of an emerging market.

34
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,019
All right.

35
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,959
Well, with that, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,700
Dad, I'd like to borrow some money.

37
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:21,939
Sure, Johnny.

38
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:22,719
How much do you need?

39
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:23,519
Five bucks?

40
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:24,980
Come on, Dad.

41
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,159
I need 30,000.

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,379
I want to get into the market.

43
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,879
You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses.

44
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,739
I look at this as an opportunity.

45
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,599
This is a chance for me to get a jumpstart on building my nest egg.

46
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:39,900
I don't know about that.

47
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,840
With all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest.

48
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,540
I don't know if you're aware, son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.

49
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:56,920
There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact upon the economy.

50
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,980
There's just too much instability.

51
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,739
I just wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.

52
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:03,219
But look at it this way.

53
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,760
Every challenge is an opportunity.

54
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,039
And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market.

55
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,460
There are emerging markets that promise great returns.

56
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:11,860
Look at China, for example.

57
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,219
They have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class.

58
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,379
Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth-generating opportunity.

59
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,219
Oh, come on, son.

60
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,520
And you're looking at this too, naively.

61
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:31,199
The Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

62
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,400
Fine, then.

63
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,379
If that's the way you feel, so be it.

64
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,400
But you're losing out on a great opportunity here.

65
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,159
I'm going to hit up mom for the cash.

66
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,979
Well, it sounds like the dad has missed out on a really big investment opportunity, hey?

67
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,039
Yeah, and his son is pretty smart.

68
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:58,340
Pretty smart little boy.

69
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,479
OK, so we have some great words that we want to look at here.

70
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,680
Why don't we start with the first one?

71
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:05,479
Turmoil.

72
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:07,680
Turmoil.

73
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:08,280
Turmoil.

74
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,599
So we have some great examples of how turmoil is used in different sentences, so let's listen.

75
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,620
Example one.

76
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,180
With a civil war, a famine, and inflation, the country has been in turmoil for 10 years.

77
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,300
Example two.

78
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:41,580
There's been a lot of turmoil in my life recently, but I've moved to a new city, I've changed my job, I broke up with my girlfriend.

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,400
Example three.

80
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,840
The devaluation of the dollar caused a great deal of turmoil in the markets.

81
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:06,159
So turmoil is a state of uncertainty, of change, of difficult times, a little bit of chaos.

82
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,060
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,780
So, for example, when there's a lot of turmoil in the market, that means stock prices are changing drastically from day to day.

84
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,500
Or the economies in turmoil, there's a lot of problems going on.

85
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,399
Yeah, uncertainty.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,379
Uncertainty.

87
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,759
OK, good word.

88
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,319
All right.

89
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:28,240
And we also saw something really interesting in the dialogue about a proposed stimulus package.

90
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,699
A proposed stimulus package.

91
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:35,220
So a proposed stimulus package is something that's going on now.

92
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:35,560
Yes.

93
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,819
Let's break this phrase down.

94
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,180
So we've got stimulus package.

95
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,579
A stimulus package, something to stimulate the economy, right?

96
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:43,980
Right.

97
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,879
So money from the government to get the economy moving.

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,600
To get it moving.

99
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,779
Stimulus package.

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,839
Proposed.

101
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,500
It means that it hasn't been approved yet.

102
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,699
It's suggested.

103
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:54,360
It's suggested.

104
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,120
It's an idea.

105
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,319
So the proposed stimulus package for the U.S.

106
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,220
economy, for example, is $150 billion.

107
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,639
Right.

108
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,319
That's $150 billion of American taxpayers' money that the government wants to put into the economy to keep it moving.

109
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,439
To keep it moving, right.

110
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:16,100
So if it works or not, that's still a debate, but it's a proposed stimulus package.

111
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,939
Let's move to our third phrase.

112
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,500
Aggregate demand.

113
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,220
Aggregate demand.

114
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,379
Aggregate demand.

115
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,019
Aggregate demand.

116
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,720
So demand is pretty clear, but this word aggregate, what's that about?

117
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,899
Aggregate is like a combined, added, right?

118
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,459
Aggregate demand.

119
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:46,579
For example, in a country like China, where cities like in Shanghai or cities like Beijing, where more and more people are accumulating wealth, the aggregate demand is increasing.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,319
Right, right.

121
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:50,560
The combined demand for consumer goods is growing.

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,040
Right.

123
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:54,040
More people have more money, so they're spending more.

124
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:54,500
Yes.

125
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,699
Okay.

126
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,800
You know, Marco, there's a ton of excellent language in this dialogue, isn't there?

127
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,199
Yeah.

128
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,660
A lot of good stuff here.

129
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:01,939
Yeah.

130
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,079
And we want to listen to the dialogue one more time.

131
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,279
But before we do, we have three words for you that we want you to listen for.

132
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:09,740
Yeah.

133
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,319
Pay attention to these words.

134
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,699
Nest egg.

135
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,019
Nest egg.

136
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,500
Inevitable.

137
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,439
Inevitable.

138
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,240
And hit up.

139
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,100
Hit up.

140
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,180
So, from the context of the dialogue, try and see if you can figure out what they mean.

141
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:27,600
But after listening to it, we'll come back and explain it anyways.

142
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,420
Dad, I'd like to borrow some money.

143
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,680
Sure, Johnny.

144
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,480
How much do you need?

145
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,220
Five bucks?

146
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:41,720
Come on, Dad.

147
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:42,800
I need thirty thousand.

148
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,100
I want to get into the market.

149
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:50,620
You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses.

150
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,500
I look at this as an opportunity.

151
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,339
This is a chance for me to get a jumpstart on building my nest egg.

152
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,639
I don't know about that.

153
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,560
With all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest.

154
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,279
I don't know if you're aware, son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.

155
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:13,639
There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact upon the economy.

156
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,740
There's just too much instability.

157
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,480
I just wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.

158
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,939
But look at it this way.

159
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,519
Every challenge is an opportunity.

160
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,779
And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market.

161
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,199
There are emerging markets that promise great returns.

162
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,620
Look at China, for example.

163
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:32,959
They have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class.

164
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:38,139
Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth-generating opportunity.

165
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:41,259
Aw, come on, son, you're looking at this too naively.

166
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:47,939
The Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

167
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,180
Fine, then.

168
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:51,120
If that's the way you feel, so be it.

169
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:53,139
But you're losing out on a great opportunity here.

170
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,839
I'm gonna hit up mom for the cash.

171
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,620
So the kid wants to invest because he wants to set up his nest egg.

172
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:05,259
That's right.

173
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:13,800
So basically, he wants to get a bunch of cash together so that he can buy a house or get married or whatever.

174
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,379
It's that money you need to start your life, right?

175
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,560
To start your life, your nest egg.

176
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,660
It's kind of a weird way of referring to this money, right?

177
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,899
I guess it is kind of funny.

178
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,819
And also, the little boy talked about investing in the domestic market.

179
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:26,160
Inevitable recession.

180
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,420
Yes, inevitable.

181
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,379
Inevitable.

182
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,620
Inevitable basically means unavoidable.

183
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,700
So this guy thinks that the recession is unavoidable.

184
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,500
It's gonna happen.

185
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,480
Yes, inevitable.

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,179
You know, this word inevitable, if you apply the root words, you can get a noun, an adjective, or an adverb, right?

187
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,840
Right.

188
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,220
So we've got some examples where you can see this word in action.

189
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,379
Example one.

190
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,659
Jason knew he was going to get laid off, but he was trying to delay the inevitable.

191
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,919
Example two.

192
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,240
As a new manager, it's inevitable that you're going to make mistakes.

193
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,620
Example three.

194
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:17,039
Inevitably, we all die at the end of our lives.

195
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:24,279
So as you can see, the noun and adjective form are the same.

196
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,059
Yes, inevitable.

197
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:25,440
Inevitable.

198
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,820
When we use it as an adverb, though, we add the ly to it.

199
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,440
Inevitably.

200
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:30,220
Inevitably.

201
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:30,799
Yes.

202
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,740
So yeah, as you can see, we could use it in many different ways depending on what we want to say.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,100
Right.

204
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,539
Well, inevitably, we have to move on to our third word.

205
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,379
Hit up.

206
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,259
Hit up.

207
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,799
So he says he's going to hit up mom for the cash.

208
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:46,279
Ask his mom.

209
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,139
Yeah, hit up.

210
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:49,419
Yeah, this is kind of a slangy term, isn't it?

211
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,639
Yeah, it's more informal.

212
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,659
A lot more slangy.

213
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:53,860
Yeah.

214
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,500
You wouldn't really use it with your boss, would you?

215
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,059
No, you're not going to go up to your boss and say, hey, I need to hit you up for some cash.

216
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,480
So Marco, I think this word is only applying to money, right?

217
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,240
Well, you wouldn't go up to your boss and say, oh, I need to hit you up for some vacation time.

218
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,360
No, it's typically used for money.

219
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,340
In this context.

220
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:11,639
Yeah.

221
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:12,080
Yeah.

222
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,460
Hit them up.

223
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,840
We've got some examples of the phrase hit up.

224
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,039
Let's listen.

225
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,899
Example one.

226
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,539
I'm going to hit up the boss for a raise.

227
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,720
Example two.

228
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,600
Are you trying to hit me up for money?

229
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,840
Example three.

230
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,279
I don't have any cash.

231
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:38,500
Have you tried hitting up Sophie?

232
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,320
She's rich.

233
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,899
Okay, so this is our first advanced lesson.

234
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,039
I hope you enjoyed it.

235
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,179
It is a lot more challenging, I think.

236
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,080
Especially because it's set in a business context.

237
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,240
So we have a lot of specific words and a lot of technical vocabulary.

238
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,039
That's right.

239
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Marco, you're exactly right.

240
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,559
And I think that our users are going to have a lot of questions about the language in this lesson.

241
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,700
So I'd like to invite you guys to come onto our website at EnglishPod.com.

243
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,820
But until then, it's goodbye.

244
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,860
Bye.
