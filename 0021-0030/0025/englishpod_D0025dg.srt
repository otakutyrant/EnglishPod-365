00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
EnglishPod.com Well right, let's move to our next order of business.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
As many of you are aware, in recent weeks there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding this bird flu issue.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu contingency plan.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Basically, we need to come up with a clear plan.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business functions in case a pandemic strikes.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So what I'd like to do is first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Ralph, I'd like you to head up this project.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Sure, no problem.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What issues do you want me to consider?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well let's see, there are a few points we need to be thinking about.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
First, I'll need you to analyse our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact and outbreak I have.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You'll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Think of ways to reduce employee customer contact.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I guess you'll need me to forecast employee absences as well, right?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I'll think about the impact this will have on our clients.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hey, what about vaccines?

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees?

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Exactly right.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So I'll leave this to you and...

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, we'll review the draft plan in two weeks.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, so anyone want to order some KFC for lunch?
