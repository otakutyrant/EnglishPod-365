00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:11,460
EnglishPod.com Well right, let's move to our next order of business.

2
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:19,859
As many of you are aware, in recent weeks there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding this bird flu issue.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,940
And it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu contingency plan.

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,039
Basically, we need to come up with a clear plan.

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,200
We need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business functions in case a pandemic strikes.

6
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:42,259
So what I'd like to do is first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan.

7
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,280
Ralph, I'd like you to head up this project.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,799
Sure, no problem.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,500
What issues do you want me to consider?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,280
Well let's see, there are a few points we need to be thinking about.

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,939
First, I'll need you to analyse our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact and outbreak I have.

12
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:04,180
You'll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected.

13
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,340
Think of ways to reduce employee customer contact.

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,260
Perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home.

15
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:16,299
I guess you'll need me to forecast employee absences as well, right?

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,819
And I'll think about the impact this will have on our clients.

17
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,219
Hey, what about vaccines?

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,799
Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees?

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,239
Exactly right.

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,820
So I'll leave this to you and...

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,480
Well, we'll review the draft plan in two weeks.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,879
Okay, so anyone want to order some KFC for lunch?
