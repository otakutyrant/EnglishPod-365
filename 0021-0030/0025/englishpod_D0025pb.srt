00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:06,660
Hello English learners and welcome to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:07,500
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,439
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,179
And today we're bringing you a great upper intermediate lesson.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:12,859
That's right.

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,260
We're going to talk about a topic that's been in the news recently.

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,000
And this topic is?

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,839
The bird flu.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,600
That's right.

10
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:22,579
So can you tell us what the bird flu really is?

11
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,960
Basically the story is a lot of chickens and birds keep getting this disease.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,660
And they've managed to pass this disease to humans.

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,859
And the fear is that humans will start to pass this disease to each other.

14
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:38,679
And a huge, huge number of people in the world could get really sick.

15
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:39,799
Yes.

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,859
So it sounds scary.

17
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:45,500
Well, it may be a little bit scary, but we do have some interesting language.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,119
We've got language to talk about a disease and language that you might use in a planning meeting at work.

19
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:52,799
All right.

20
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,899
So let's start by looking at our vocabulary preview for this dialogue.

21
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:58,799
Vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:00:59,659
Okay.

23
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,960
The first word on our vocabulary preview today is contingency plan.

24
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,500
Contingency plan.

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,900
Contingency plan.

26
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:07,879
Contingency plan.

27
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,579
So a contingency plan is a?

28
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,680
A plan that you make to prepare for an emergency.

29
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,920
So like a backup plan.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,439
Exactly.

31
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:16,980
Okay.

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:17,219
Yeah.

33
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,200
Contingency plan.

34
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,120
And our last word for the vocabulary preview today is pandemic.

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,060
Pandemic.

36
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,000
Pandemic.

37
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:25,640
Pandemic.

38
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,060
So a pandemic is something scary.

39
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:28,799
Well, yes.

40
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,019
It's an event where a disease affects a lot of people.

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,920
Like we're talking millions of people.

42
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:35,719
Okay.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,900
And it spreads very quickly.

44
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,159
And it goes international.

45
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:41,099
Okay.

46
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:44,700
So a disease that spreads very fast and goes everywhere.

47
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,319
Exactly.

48
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,319
Pandemic.

49
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:46,780
Okay.

50
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,159
Okay.

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,959
So we're ready to listen to our dialogue.

52
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,579
We are going to be at a business meeting where people are talking about a contingency plan.

53
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,439
Well, right.

54
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Let's move to our next order of business.

55
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,139
As many of you are aware, in recent weeks, there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding this bird flu issue.

56
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:20,300
And it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu contingency plan.

57
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,280
Basically, we need to come up with a clear plan.

58
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:30,340
We need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business functions in case a pandemic strikes.

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,539
So what I'd like to do is first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan.

60
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,520
Ralph, I'd like you to head up this project.

61
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,439
Sure.

62
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,060
No problem.

63
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,759
What issues do you want me to consider?

64
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:43,979
Well, let's see.

65
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,500
There are a few points we need to be thinking about.

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,199
First, I'll need you to analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact an outbreak may have.

67
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,439
You'll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected.

68
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:06,460
Think of ways to reduce employee customer contact, perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home.

69
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,580
I guess you'll need me to forecast employee absences as well, right?

70
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,080
And I'll think about the impact this will have on our clients.

71
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,460
Hey, what about vaccines?

72
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,060
Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees?

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,979
Exactly right, huh?

74
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:32,280
So I'll leave this to you, and we'll review the draft plan in two weeks, okay?

75
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:35,139
So anyone want to order some KFC for lunch?

76
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,520
All right, what an ironic meeting.

77
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,039
They are talking about the bird flu, and they are going to have chicken.

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,479
Yes, after sneezing all over.

79
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,599
Yeah, I guess now we could take a look at our language takeaway for this dialogue.

80
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,379
Language takeaway.

81
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,419
We heard a lot of really useful language in this dialogue, and right now we're going to look at four different words from the dialogue.

82
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,539
The first one is critical.

83
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,620
Critical.

84
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:09,479
Critical.

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,460
We've got some examples of this word that will help us to understand the meaning, so let's listen.

86
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,300
Example one.

87
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,819
It's absolutely critical that we increase our sales.

88
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,819
If not, the company will go bankrupt.

89
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,860
Example two.

90
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,259
We have a critical shortage of food.

91
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,620
If we don't get help, people will die.

92
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,000
Example three.

93
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:44,079
This is a critical step in the process.

94
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,899
You can't make a mistake here.

95
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:51,060
So when something's critical, it's basically...

96
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,579
Really important, really urgent.

97
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:53,079
Right.

98
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,319
Okay, great word.

99
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:54,779
Critical.

100
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,339
The next word we have is outbreak.

101
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,420
Outbreak.

102
00:04:58,899 --> 00:04:59,339
Outbreak.

103
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,680
An outbreak.

104
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,180
So an outbreak is a sudden start of a disease, right?

105
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,740
Can I say, oh, I got an outbreak of flu?

106
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,100
Can outbreak describe one person?

107
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
No, an outbreak means that it's infecting a lot of people.

108
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:16,300
Not only one person.

109
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,379
So that we could say there was an outbreak of the flu at the office.

110
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,660
Which there was.

111
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,920
Yeah, a lot of people got sick here with the flu.

112
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,480
Okay, why don't you tell us about our third word?

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,939
Our third word is forecast.

114
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,079
Forecast.

115
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,120
Forecast.

116
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,259
Forecast.

117
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,439
So to forecast basically means to predict.

118
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,019
Exactly.

119
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,779
For example, you talk about the weather forecast.

120
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,240
Yep.

121
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,220
Okay, great.

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,139
And the last word for our language takeaway is vaccines.

123
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:45,800
Vaccines.

124
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:46,529
Vaccines.

125
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:47,589
Vaccines.

126
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,879
So vaccines are something we all had when we were children.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,480
That's true.

128
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,079
They are injections that you get to prevent you from getting sick later.

129
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:05,100
Right, so an injection of medicine from your doctor so that you don't get a disease in the future.

130
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,879
Right, when we are small we get polio vaccines.

131
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,579
Yeah, or measles vaccines.

132
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:10,480
Measles, right.

133
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,600
A lot of common diseases.

134
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,180
Yes.

135
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,699
Okay, so that's all for language takeaway.

136
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,480
Some great language related to health and disease.

137
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,160
But we also heard some great business related words in this dialogue.

138
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,800
That's true.

139
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,079
There's a lot of words that you can use in a planning meeting.

140
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,620
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,759
Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,819
In today's Fluency Builder we're going to look at four useful phrases.

143
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:41,180
Now this first phrase you can use when you want to change the subject at a meeting.

144
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,839
Let's listen to what they said in the dialogue.

145
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,620
Let's move to our next order of business.

146
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,579
Let's move to our next order of business.

147
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,019
Okay, so let's move to our next order of business.

148
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,500
It's a great way of saying let's move on.

149
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:00,079
Exactly.

150
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:01,560
Let's pass to the next topic.

151
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,500
Great.

152
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,779
Speaking of passing to the next topic, we heard another really interesting phrase in the dialogue.

153
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,660
Let's listen.

154
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:10,100
We need to come up with a clear plan.

155
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,259
We need to come up with a clear plan.

156
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,040
So we need to come up with a clear plan.

157
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,680
We need to think of a clear plan.

158
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,000
We need to come up with.

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,180
Okay, our third phrase we heard in the dialogue is this.

160
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,439
Okay, I'd like you to head up this project.

161
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,100
So this phrase head up, this is a great phrase.

162
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,660
It means I'd like you to lead or take care of this project.

163
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:44,600
Okay, and the last phrase for Fluency Builder you can use when you want to give someone the responsibility of a job.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,879
We heard this.

165
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:49,120
So I'll leave this to you.

166
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,300
So I'll leave this to you.

167
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,079
So I'll leave this to you.

168
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,879
This is you take charge.

169
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:56,579
Exactly.

170
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,899
I'll leave this to you.

171
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,500
That's a great way of delegating a responsibility.

172
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:09,279
And so we're going to leave you to listen to our dialogue last time and be sure to pick up all the great vocabulary that we just talked about.

173
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,139
Well, right.

174
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:18,439
But let's move to our next order of business.

175
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:32,919
As many of you are aware in recent weeks, there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding this bird flu issue, and it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu contingency plan.

176
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,000
Basically, we need to come up with a clear plan.

177
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:43,019
We need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business functions in case a pandemic strikes.

178
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,240
So what I'd like to do is first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan.

179
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,279
Ralph, I'd like you to head up this project.

180
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,759
Sure, no problem.

181
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,440
What issues do you want me to consider?

182
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:56,679
Well, let's see.

183
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:59,200
There are a few points we need to be thinking about.

184
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:05,899
First, I'll need you to analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact and outbreak I have.

185
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,120
You will also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected.

186
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:19,220
Think of ways to reduce employee customer contact, perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home.

187
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,240
I guess you'll need me to forecast employee absences as well, right?

188
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,779
And I'll think about the impact this will have on our clients.

189
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,159
Hey, what about vaccines?

190
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,779
Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for employees?

191
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,179
Exactly right.

192
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:44,460
So I'll leave this to you and well, we'll review the draft plan in two weeks.

193
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,960
OK, so anyone want to order some KFC for lunch?

194
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,559
OK, great.

195
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,580
So this contingency plan idea is really interesting, right?

196
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, it makes sense for a company to prepare in case there is an outbreak of bird flu.

197
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,179
I mean, they need to maintain their critical business functions, even if all the employees are sick.

198
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:11,840
Right.

199
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,659
I guess that's really important.

200
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:23,620
And you have to forecast all these possibilities, like people are going to be away from the office or even forecast less sales, etc.

201
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:24,559
That's right.

202
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:33,200
The interesting thing is that businesses that may not actually be involved in food production or raising chickens or something like that are making these contingency plans.

203
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:34,539
I find that really fascinating.

204
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,340
So it seems there is a lot of fear out there about the possibility of a pandemic.

205
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:39,879
Yeah.

206
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,500
Yeah.

207
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,720
Well, hopefully they'll come out with a vaccine so we don't have to worry about these things.

208
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,559
That's true.

209
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,779
But until then, we'll have to create contingency plans.

210
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:49,279
That's right.

211
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:56,879
OK, guys, we're out of time today and I hope you enjoyed our lesson and found all these words and phrases really useful and you can apply them in real life.

Goodbye.
