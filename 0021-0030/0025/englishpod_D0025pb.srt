00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English learners and welcome to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we're bringing you a great upper intermediate lesson.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're going to talk about a topic that's been in the news recently.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And this topic is?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The bird flu.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's right.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So can you tell us what the bird flu really is?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Basically the story is a lot of chickens and birds keep getting this disease.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And they've managed to pass this disease to humans.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And the fear is that humans will start to pass this disease to each other.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And a huge, huge number of people in the world could get really sick.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So it sounds scary.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, it may be a little bit scary, but we do have some interesting language.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We've got language to talk about a disease and language that you might use in a planning meeting at work.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
All right.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So let's start by looking at our vocabulary preview for this dialogue.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The first word on our vocabulary preview today is contingency plan.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Contingency plan.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Contingency plan.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Contingency plan.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So a contingency plan is a?

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A plan that you make to prepare for an emergency.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So like a backup plan.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Exactly.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Contingency plan.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And our last word for the vocabulary preview today is pandemic.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Pandemic.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Pandemic.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Pandemic.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So a pandemic is something scary.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, yes.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's an event where a disease affects a lot of people.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Like we're talking millions of people.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And it spreads very quickly.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And it goes international.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So a disease that spreads very fast and goes everywhere.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Exactly.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Pandemic.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So we're ready to listen to our dialogue.

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We are going to be at a business meeting where people are talking about a contingency plan.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, right.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's move to our next order of business.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
As many of you are aware, in recent weeks, there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding this bird flu issue.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu contingency plan.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Basically, we need to come up with a clear plan.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business functions in case a pandemic strikes.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So what I'd like to do is first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ralph, I'd like you to head up this project.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Sure.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No problem.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What issues do you want me to consider?

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well, let's see.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There are a few points we need to be thinking about.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
First, I'll need you to analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact an outbreak may have.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You'll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Think of ways to reduce employee customer contact, perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I guess you'll need me to forecast employee absences as well, right?

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And I'll think about the impact this will have on our clients.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hey, what about vaccines?

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees?

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Exactly right, huh?

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So I'll leave this to you, and we'll review the draft plan in two weeks, okay?

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So anyone want to order some KFC for lunch?

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
All right, what an ironic meeting.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They are talking about the bird flu, and they are going to have chicken.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, after sneezing all over.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, I guess now we could take a look at our language takeaway for this dialogue.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Language takeaway.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We heard a lot of really useful language in this dialogue, and right now we're going to look at four different words from the dialogue.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The first one is critical.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Critical.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Critical.

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We've got some examples of this word that will help us to understand the meaning, so let's listen.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Example one.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's absolutely critical that we increase our sales.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If not, the company will go bankrupt.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Example two.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We have a critical shortage of food.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If we don't get help, people will die.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Example three.

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is a critical step in the process.

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You can't make a mistake here.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So when something's critical, it's basically...

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Really important, really urgent.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Right.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, great word.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Critical.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The next word we have is outbreak.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Outbreak.

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Outbreak.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
An outbreak.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So an outbreak is a sudden start of a disease, right?

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Can I say, oh, I got an outbreak of flu?

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Can outbreak describe one person?

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No, an outbreak means that it's infecting a lot of people.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Not only one person.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So that we could say there was an outbreak of the flu at the office.

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Which there was.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, a lot of people got sick here with the flu.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, why don't you tell us about our third word?

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Our third word is forecast.

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Forecast.

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Forecast.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Forecast.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So to forecast basically means to predict.

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Exactly.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
For example, you talk about the weather forecast.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yep.

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay, great.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And the last word for our language takeaway is vaccines.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Vaccines.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Vaccines.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Vaccines.

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So vaccines are something we all had when we were children.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's true.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They are injections that you get to prevent you from getting sick later.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Right, so an injection of medicine from your doctor so that you don't get a disease in the future.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Right, when we are small we get polio vaccines.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, or measles vaccines.

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Measles, right.

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
A lot of common diseases.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes.

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay, so that's all for language takeaway.

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Some great language related to health and disease.

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But we also heard some great business related words in this dialogue.

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's true.

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There's a lot of words that you can use in a planning meeting.

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
In today's Fluency Builder we're going to look at four useful phrases.

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Now this first phrase you can use when you want to change the subject at a meeting.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's listen to what they said in the dialogue.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's move to our next order of business.

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's move to our next order of business.

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay, so let's move to our next order of business.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's a great way of saying let's move on.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Exactly.

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's pass to the next topic.

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Great.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Speaking of passing to the next topic, we heard another really interesting phrase in the dialogue.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's listen.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We need to come up with a clear plan.

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We need to come up with a clear plan.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So we need to come up with a clear plan.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We need to think of a clear plan.

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We need to come up with.

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, our third phrase we heard in the dialogue is this.

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay, I'd like you to head up this project.

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So this phrase head up, this is a great phrase.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It means I'd like you to lead or take care of this project.

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay, and the last phrase for Fluency Builder you can use when you want to give someone the responsibility of a job.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We heard this.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So I'll leave this to you.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So I'll leave this to you.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So I'll leave this to you.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This is you take charge.

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Exactly.

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll leave this to you.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's a great way of delegating a responsibility.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And so we're going to leave you to listen to our dialogue last time and be sure to pick up all the great vocabulary that we just talked about.

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, right.

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But let's move to our next order of business.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:32,000
As many of you are aware in recent weeks, there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding this bird flu issue, and it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu contingency plan.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Basically, we need to come up with a clear plan.

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business functions in case a pandemic strikes.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So what I'd like to do is first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan.

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ralph, I'd like you to head up this project.

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Sure, no problem.

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What issues do you want me to consider?

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Well, let's see.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There are a few points we need to be thinking about.

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
First, I'll need you to analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact and outbreak I have.

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You will also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected.

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Think of ways to reduce employee customer contact, perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home.

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I guess you'll need me to forecast employee absences as well, right?

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And I'll think about the impact this will have on our clients.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hey, what about vaccines?

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for employees?

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Exactly right.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So I'll leave this to you and well, we'll review the draft plan in two weeks.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
OK, so anyone want to order some KFC for lunch?

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
OK, great.

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So this contingency plan idea is really interesting, right?

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, it makes sense for a company to prepare in case there is an outbreak of bird flu.

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I mean, they need to maintain their critical business functions, even if all the employees are sick.

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Right.

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I guess that's really important.

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And you have to forecast all these possibilities, like people are going to be away from the office or even forecast less sales, etc.

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's right.

202
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The interesting thing is that businesses that may not actually be involved in food production or raising chickens or something like that are making these contingency plans.

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I find that really fascinating.

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So it seems there is a lot of fear out there about the possibility of a pandemic.

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah.

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah.

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, hopefully they'll come out with a vaccine so we don't have to worry about these things.

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's true.

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But until then, we'll have to create contingency plans.

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's right.

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
OK, guys, we're out of time today and I hope you enjoyed our lesson and found all these words and phrases really useful and you can apply them in real life.

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Goodbye.
