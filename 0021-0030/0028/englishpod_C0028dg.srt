00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com I'm so relieved that your ankle wasn't broken.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I feel just awful about this whole thing.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to make it up to you.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let me take you out to dinner tonight, my treat.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, that sounds great.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'd love to.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Here's my address.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Pick me up at eight?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Perfect.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thank you for such a lovely evening.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The food was amazing and I had a great time.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Me too.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You look so beautiful tonight.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I wish this night would never end.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There's something that I have to tell you.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But what is it?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I woke up today thinking that this would be just like any other day.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But I was wrong.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The twist of fate brought us together.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I crashed into your life and you into mine.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you, Veronica.
