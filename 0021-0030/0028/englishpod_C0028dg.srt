00:00:01,999 --> 00:00:09,119
EnglishPod.com I'm so relieved that your ankle wasn't broken.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,400
I feel just awful about this whole thing.

3
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:12,919
I want to make it up to you.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,900
Let me take you out to dinner tonight, my treat.

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:16,719
Oh, that sounds great.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,699
I'd love to.

7
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:19,260
Here's my address.

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,440
Pick me up at eight?

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,359
Perfect.

10
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:36,640
Thank you for such a lovely evening.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,420
The food was amazing and I had a great time.

12
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,060
Me too.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,579
You look so beautiful tonight.

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,380
I wish this night would never end.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,500
There's something that I have to tell you.

16
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:47,659
But what is it?

17
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,820
I woke up today thinking that this would be just like any other day.

18
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:53,359
But I was wrong.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,820
The twist of fate brought us together.

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,140
I crashed into your life and you into mine.

21
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,780
This may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you, Veronica.
