00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,280
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,080
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're bringing you the sequel of I'm Sorry I Love You.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,960
Part two.

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:11,679
Part two.

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,400
That's right.

8
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,500
I guess a lot of our listeners enjoyed the first part.

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,420
And since it was such a romantic hit dialogue and hit, we're bringing part two.

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:28,059
So it's even more romantic and I'm sure everyone is going to find some great and useful language in it.

11
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:28,519
That's right.

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,780
We've got language that we use to talk about dates.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,740
A date, yeah.

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,640
So useful language for when you're going on a date.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,520
That's right.

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,280
Well, before we look at this date language, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,979
I'm so relieved that your ankle wasn't broken.

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,259
I feel just awful about this whole thing.

19
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,020
I want to make it up to you.

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,280
Let me take you out to dinner tonight.

21
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:55,740
My treat.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,600
Oh, that sounds great.

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,579
I'd love to.

24
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:00,119
Here's my address.

25
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,299
Pick me up a date.

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,200
Perfect.

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,500
Thank you for such a lovely evening.

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,280
The food was amazing and I had a great time.

29
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:20,900
Me too.

30
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,459
You look so beautiful tonight.

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,239
I wish this night would never end.

32
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:27,359
There's something that I have to tell you.

33
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,519
But what is it?

34
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,260
I woke up today thinking that this would be just like any other day, but I was wrong.

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,680
The twist of fate brought us together.

36
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,659
I crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you, Veronica.

37
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,959
Wow, such a romantic dialogue.

38
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,540
It really sounds like they're falling in love.

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:11,560
Yeah, it's a really romantic thing that's going on right now, but there was some really useful words here, so why don't we take a look at language takeaway.

40
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:14,680
Language takeaway.

41
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,120
Today we have three words for language takeaway and the first one is relieved.

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,419
Relieved.

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,460
Relieved.

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,680
So we have some great examples on how we use relieved and I'm really sure you can understand the meaning from the sentences.

45
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,740
Example one.

46
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,080
They were relieved to hear that the company would not be making any layoffs.

47
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,219
Example two.

48
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,879
I'm so relieved to hear your voice.

49
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,099
I was worried something happened to you.

50
00:02:51,919 --> 00:03:00,199
I guess relieved is like a happy or relaxed feeling that you get if you avoid something bad, right?

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,520
Right.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,659
I'm so relieved that didn't happen.

53
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,979
Now for our second word.

54
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:06,020
Pick me up.

55
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,340
Pick me up.

56
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,979
Pick me up.

57
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,560
So when you ask someone to pick you up, you're saying basically.

58
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:13,479
Come and get me.

59
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,659
OK, so let's let's give a couple of examples.

60
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,479
My husband was supposed to pick me up from work yesterday, but he forgot.

61
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,539
Does that really happen?

62
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,139
Yes.

63
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,620
All right, we'll have a talk with him or we could also say, oh, I need to hurry up.

64
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,400
The taxi will pick me up at seven.

65
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:33,960
So come and get me.

66
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,240
Right.

67
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,080
Pick me up.

68
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:43,560
And our final word in today's language takeaway is ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary.

69
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:47,240
So ordinary is a normal word.

70
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,840
Yes.

71
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:48,539
Meaning?

72
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,620
It's normal.

73
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,419
Nothing uncommon about it.

74
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:51,840
Yeah.

75
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:57,719
So you can have like an ordinary person, an ordinary day, an ordinary day, ordinary life.

76
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,300
Uh huh.

77
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,860
Nothing exciting about it.

78
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,800
What else is ordinary?

79
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,860
Ordinary podcast.

80
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,479
An ordinary podcast, which English pod is not.

81
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,919
So ordinary.

82
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:08,620
OK.

83
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,400
Great words.

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,439
And I guess now we can listen to our dialogue a second time.

85
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,639
This time it'll be a little bit slower and this will help you to understand the language more clearly.

86
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm so relieved that your ankle wasn't broken.

87
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:30,899
I feel just awful about this whole thing.

88
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:33,000
I want to make it up to you.

89
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,480
Let me take you out to dinner tonight.

90
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,519
My treat.

91
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
That sounds great.

92
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,199
I'd love to.

93
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,139
Here is my address.

94
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,199
Pick me up at eight.

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,600
Perfect.

96
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,800
Thank you for such a lovely evening.

97
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,800
The food was amazing and I had a great time.

98
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:53,959
Me too.

99
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,360
You look so beautiful tonight.

100
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,740
I wish this night would never end.

101
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,459
There's something I have to tell you.

102
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,339
What is it?

103
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,439
I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day.

104
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,839
But I was wrong.

105
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,939
A twist of fate brought us together.

106
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,360
I crashed into your life and you into mine.

107
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,060
This may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you, Veronica.

108
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,339
OK, so we looked at some great vocabulary and now we can look at some great phrases.

109
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,339
So let's start with Fluency Builder.

110
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:39,819
Fluency Builder.

111
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:43,779
On Fluency Builder today we have three great phrases.

112
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,060
So why don't we just start with the first one?

113
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,620
Yeah, the first one we heard at the beginning of the dialogue.

114
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,980
Make it up to you.

115
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,399
Make it up to you.

116
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,560
Make it up to you.

117
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,860
OK, so we have some great examples on how we use make it up.

118
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,819
So let's listen.

119
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,660
Example one.

120
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,680
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday.

121
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,699
How can I make it up to you?

122
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,860
Example two.

123
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,959
I feel terrible for calling your mother fat.

124
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:22,379
I want to make it up to her, so I got her these flowers.

125
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,620
Example three.

126
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,199
John forgot my anniversary again.

127
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,500
He's going to have to make it up to me.

128
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:51,480
We can see from the examples that when you use the phrase make it up to you, you're kind of saying you want to balance something bad you did with some good action, right?

129
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,279
Right.

130
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,000
So if you call your mother-in-law fat.

131
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,139
You better buy her at least some flowers or a card or something.

132
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,240
To make it up, right?

133
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,879
So the bad action was?

134
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,000
Calling her fat.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,819
And the balancing good action was the flowers.

136
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,600
I don't think flowers will be enough though.

137
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,420
Looks like a doomed marriage.

138
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,139
OK, our second phrase.

139
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,399
My treat.

140
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:16,779
My treat.

141
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,180
So we use this phrase when we want to say I'll invite you, I'll pay for you.

142
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:22,680
I'll pay.

143
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,300
Right, so I can say hey let's go get some beers.

144
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,420
It's my treat.

145
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,300
Oh, thanks Marco.

146
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,560
So I'm paying, right?

147
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,899
My treat.

148
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,339
And our last phrase for Fluency Builder.

149
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,920
A twist of fate.

150
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,019
A twist of fate.

151
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,399
A twist of fate.

152
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,620
So Erica, what is a twist of fate?

153
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:52,000
A twist of fate is an unplanned event that has a big impact on your future or your life.

154
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:52,680
OK.

155
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,579
Marco, can you give us an example of a twist of fate?

156
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,000
Alright, for example.

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,040
OK, you're supposed to catch a flight to another country, alright?

158
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,899
But you're late so you miss your flight.

159
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:05,540
OK.

160
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,939
And that flight crashes.

161
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:09,480
Wow.

162
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,600
Right, so that's a twist of fate.

163
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,819
So yeah, it's like fate, it's like destiny.

164
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:20,360
You weren't supposed to be on that flight.

165
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,040
OK, so a twist of fate.

166
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,819
A twist of fate.

167
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,339
Great.

168
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:28,500
On a happier note, let's listen to the dialogue a third time.

169
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,600
Great.

170
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:08,559
Thank you for such a lovely evening.

171
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,360
The food was amazing and I had a great time.

172
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:11,980
Me too.

173
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,500
You look so beautiful tonight.

174
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,299
I wish this night would never end.

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,399
There's something that I have to tell you.

176
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,600
But what is it?

177
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,840
I woke up today thinking that this would be just like any other day.

178
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,299
And I was wrong.

179
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,740
The twist of fate brought us together.

180
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,059
I crashed into your life and you into mine.

181
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,720
And this may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you, Veronica.

182
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,039
OK, so we're back.

183
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,639
Erika, I know you have a story of a twist of fate in your life.

184
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,299
Yes, recently actually this happened.

185
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:04,100
I went to this party and at the party there was a contest, like sort of a lottery.

186
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:06,919
You could buy some tickets and win a prize.

187
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,159
And the prize was a week-long vacation.

188
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,059
So I went with some friends of mine and they were tired.

189
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,500
So they left early and they gave me their tickets.

190
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,299
And guess what happened?

191
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,200
What happened?

192
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,139
We won.

193
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,200
We won the week-long vacation.

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah, it was amazing.

195
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:27,419
So that was a really lucky twist of fate for me.

196
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,340
Yeah, that's a good story.

197
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,419
I'm sure it wasn't that good of a twist of fate for your friends.

198
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,899
Yeah, but they were very generous and let me have the prize anyway.

199
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:37,899
All right.

200
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,620
Well, we want to hear your stories of maybe some type of twist of fate that you've had.

201
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

202
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:46,539
Maybe love stories, maybe tragic stories, any story.

203
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:57,919

Yes, that's right.

205
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,700
So I guess until then, it's goodbye.
