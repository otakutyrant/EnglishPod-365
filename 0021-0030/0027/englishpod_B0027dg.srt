EnglishPod.com Mr.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,460
McKenna, do you have a second?

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,259
I need to talk to you about something.

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:15,859
Sure.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,300
Liv, what can I do for you?

6
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,160
Well, I was just wondering.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:27,160
You see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister's getting married and the wedding is overseas and, well...

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,879
You want to take some time off, is that right?

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,859
Well, sir, I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,600
What dates are you planning on taking off?

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,759
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

12
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,899
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

13
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,299
Would you be okay with that?

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,439
Well, I guess so.
