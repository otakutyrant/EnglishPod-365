EnglishPod.com Mr.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
McKenna, do you have a second?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I need to talk to you about something.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sure.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Liv, what can I do for you?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, I was just wondering.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister's getting married and the wedding is overseas and, well...

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You want to take some time off, is that right?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, sir, I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What dates are you planning on taking off?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Would you be okay with that?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, I guess so.
