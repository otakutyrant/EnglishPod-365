00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:01,760
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,339
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,719
Today I'm here with Erika.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,519
Hi, Marco.

5
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,540
And I'm Marco.

6
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,099
And we're bringing you a great elementary lesson about a situation at an office.

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,779
That's true.

8
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,219
Today we're going to learn some phrases for asking for time off.

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:17,100
Right.

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,219
Asking for time off.

11
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,420
Or asking for leave.

12
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,440
Asking for leave.

13
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:20,760
Right.

14
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:21,260
Right.

15
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,219
So we're going to give you some great phrases and vocabulary for when you want to ask for leave.

16
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,320
So let's just listen to our dialogue today.

17
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,560
We're at an office where Liv wants some time off.

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:42,939
Mr.

19
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,240
McKenna, do you have a second?

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,039
I need to talk to you about something.

21
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:46,640
Sure.

22
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,100
Liv, what can I do for you?

23
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, I was just wondering.

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,939
You see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister's getting married and the wedding is overseas and, well...

25
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,679
You want to take some time off, is that right?

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,640
Well, sir, I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,420
What dates are you planning on taking off?

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,560
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,560
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,099
Would you be okay with that?

31
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,100
Well, I guess so.

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,659
Well, it sounds like the boss wasn't too happy about Liv's request.

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,760
Well, she wanted to take off for 30 days, so...

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,200
I guess that is a long time.

35
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,420
That is a long time.

36
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,400
I wish I could do that.

37
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:36,780
Yeah.

38
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,200
Okay, we have some great words for you today, so let's start with our language takeaway.

39
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:48,260
We have four words on our language takeaway today.

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,079
Erica, why don't you tell us the first one?

41
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,840
The first word is vacation days.

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,980
Vacation days.

43
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,299
Vacation days.

44
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,340
So what are vacation days?

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,359
Basically, it's the number of personal leave days.

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,659
So the number of days that you can take to go on vacation.

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,580
How many vacation days do you have?

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,419
Yeah, I think I have not so many.

49
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,520
I only have 10 vacation days.

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,479
Well, in some countries, their 10 vacation days is normal.

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,139
In others, I guess it's 10, 15, even 20, I've heard.

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,960
Yeah, yeah, well...

53
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,300
Vacation days.

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,400
We can't take too many vacation days or else we won't make any more podcasts.

55
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,139
I know.

56
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,919
Why don't we look at our second word?

57
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:31,500
Overseas.

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,319
Overseas.

59
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:34,740
Overseas.

60
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,580
When you travel overseas, you travel over the ocean.

61
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:40,199
Over the ocean to another country.

62
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,620
Exactly.

63
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,819
Okay, overseas.

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,080
Okay, and our third word for language takeaway, unpaid leave.

65
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,280
Unpaid leave.

66
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,500
Unpaid leave.

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,539
So this is time off without pay.

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,340
Without pay.

69
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:54,719
Simple.

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,280
Right, unpaid leave.

71
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,500
And our last word, notice.

72
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,599
Notice.

73
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:01,699
Notice.

74
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:02,300
Notice.

75
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,159
So we have some great examples on how we use notice and from these examples, I'm sure you'll be able to understand exactly what they mean.

76
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:13,060
Example one.

77
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,599
If you want to quit your job, make sure you give enough notice.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,460
You'll need to tell us four weeks in advance.

79
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,759
Example two.

80
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,219
You didn't give me enough notice about this project.

81
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,379
I didn't have enough time to finish it.

82
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,900
Example three.

83
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,060
So when you give someone notice, you give them information in advance.

84
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,060
In advance, right.

85
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:53,780
So if I want to take time off, I need to give my boss notice, advance information.

86
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,960
Right, 15-day notice or a 20-day notice, et cetera.

87
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,599
Great, so that's our language takeaway for today.

88
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:06,500
Now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time and this time it's going to be really slow.

89
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,620
Mr.

90
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,000
McKenna, do you have a second?

91
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,680
I need to talk to you about something.

92
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:19,759
Sure.

93
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,279
Liv, what can I do for you?

94
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:35,759
Well, I was just wondering, you see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister is getting married and the wedding is overseas and, well...

95
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,240
You want to take some time off, is that right?

96
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,480
Well, sir, I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

97
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,279
What dates are you planning on taking off?

98
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,720
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

99
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,920
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

100
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,839
Would you be okay with that?

101
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,319
I guess so.

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:15,420
A lot of non-native English speakers sometimes feel quite nervous about asking their boss for time off, hey?

103
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,040
Yeah, I guess it's kind of a difficult subject.

104
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:24,899
Yeah, but today we're going to teach you some great phrases that you can use next time you need to ask for some time off.

105
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,420
Great, so why don't we take a look at putting it together.

106
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,579
Putting it together.

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,920
Okay, so I'm putting it together today.

108
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,579
We're going to talk about some great phrases that you can use when approaching your boss.

109
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,339
Yes, we heard Liv say this, do you have a second?

110
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,560
Do you have a second?

111
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,379
This is a nice way to make sure your boss isn't busy when you want to ask him something.

112
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:58,000
Right, but we could also say this in two different ways.

113
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:58,920
Let's listen.

114
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,720
Do you have a minute?

115
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,399
I want to ask you something.

116
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,160
Do you have a sec?

117
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,500
I need to talk to you.

118
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,839
A great way to approach your boss.

119
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,759
Yeah, I love this phrase, do you have a sec?

120
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,399
Yeah, do you have a sec?

121
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,819
It's really natural.

122
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,420
Okay, so you've asked your boss for leave and you want to make sure that he agrees with you.

123
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,439
Yes, and this is how Liv did it.

124
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,300
Would you be okay with that?

125
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,860
This is a great pattern and we've got two other examples of how you can use it.

126
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,339
Example one.

127
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,060
Are you alright with that?

128
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,040
Example two.

129
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,139
Will you be okay with this?

130
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,779
Example three.

131
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm fine with that.

132
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,319
Okay, great examples, great patterns, really useful language.

133
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:54,720
Yes.

134
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,819
Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue a third time.

135
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,199
Mr.

136
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,480
McKenna, do you have a second?

137
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,279
I need to talk to you about something.

138
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,339
Sure, Liv, what can I do for you?

139
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:22,220
Well, I was just wondering, you see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister's getting married and the wedding is overseas and, well...

140
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,920
You want to take some time off, is that right?

141
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,879
Well, sir, I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

142
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,660
What dates are you planning on taking off?

143
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,800
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

144
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:38,839
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,339
Would you be okay with that?

146
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,340
Well, I guess so.

147
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,579
I really noticed how Liv in this dialogue used a lot of really polite language, hey?

148
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,600
Yeah, I guess when you're talking to your boss, you really have to be respectful and you have to use really polite language.

149
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,819
What sort of things did she do to make herself seem more polite?

150
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,319
Well, she said a couple of interesting phrases.

151
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,079
For example, well, I was just wondering.

152
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,220
Yeah, I was just wondering.

153
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,000
Right?

154
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,060
Well, she's kind of setting up to ask for a favor or something.

155
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,279
And she also used another phrase that I thought was interesting.

156
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,100
Yeah, she also said, I was just hoping that, right?

157
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,680
I was just hoping that maybe I could take some time off.

158
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,899
Yeah, again, that sort of doesn't sound too strong, so it seems a bit more polite.

159
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,440
Yeah, because if she said, well, I want to take some time off, that's too strong.

160
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,840
Yeah, so I was just hoping.

161
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,759
And then, well, the boss says, okay, well, when do you want to leave?

162
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,159
And she says, well, I was thinking of, right?

163
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,419
I was thinking of, again, if she would have said, I want to, too strong, right?

164
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,799
Yeah, in English, sometimes we are careful to not be too direct when we're asking for something, right?

165
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,320
Right, yeah.

166
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,779
Because if you're too direct, you sound a little bit impolite.

167
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:08,720
Yeah, you sound rude.

168
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,659
Okay, so great tips and great things to take into consideration the next time you're talking into your boss.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,720
All right, guys, we're out of time, but thanks for listening.

170
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,840
And be sure to check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,580
Right, where you can leave all your questions and comments and we'll be there to answer them.

172
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,379
But I guess until then, it's goodbye.
