00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Today I'm here with Erika.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi, Marco.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Marco.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And we're bringing you a great elementary lesson about a situation at an office.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's true.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today we're going to learn some phrases for asking for time off.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Right.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Asking for time off.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Or asking for leave.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Asking for leave.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Right.

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Right.

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we're going to give you some great phrases and vocabulary for when you want to ask for leave.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So let's just listen to our dialogue today.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We're at an office where Liv wants some time off.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Mr.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
McKenna, do you have a second?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I need to talk to you about something.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Sure.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Liv, what can I do for you?

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, I was just wondering.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister's getting married and the wedding is overseas and, well...

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You want to take some time off, is that right?

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, sir, I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What dates are you planning on taking off?

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Would you be okay with that?

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, I guess so.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, it sounds like the boss wasn't too happy about Liv's request.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, she wanted to take off for 30 days, so...

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I guess that is a long time.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That is a long time.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I wish I could do that.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay, we have some great words for you today, so let's start with our language takeaway.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We have four words on our language takeaway today.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Erica, why don't you tell us the first one?

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The first word is vacation days.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Vacation days.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Vacation days.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So what are vacation days?

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Basically, it's the number of personal leave days.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So the number of days that you can take to go on vacation.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How many vacation days do you have?

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, I think I have not so many.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I only have 10 vacation days.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, in some countries, their 10 vacation days is normal.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In others, I guess it's 10, 15, even 20, I've heard.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, yeah, well...

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Vacation days.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We can't take too many vacation days or else we won't make any more podcasts.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I know.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why don't we look at our second word?

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Overseas.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Overseas.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Overseas.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
When you travel overseas, you travel over the ocean.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Over the ocean to another country.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Exactly.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay, overseas.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, and our third word for language takeaway, unpaid leave.

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Unpaid leave.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Unpaid leave.

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So this is time off without pay.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Without pay.

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Simple.

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Right, unpaid leave.

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And our last word, notice.

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Notice.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Notice.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Notice.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So we have some great examples on how we use notice and from these examples, I'm sure you'll be able to understand exactly what they mean.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Example one.

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you want to quit your job, make sure you give enough notice.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You'll need to tell us four weeks in advance.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Example two.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You didn't give me enough notice about this project.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I didn't have enough time to finish it.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Example three.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So when you give someone notice, you give them information in advance.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
In advance, right.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So if I want to take time off, I need to give my boss notice, advance information.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Right, 15-day notice or a 20-day notice, et cetera.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Great, so that's our language takeaway for today.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time and this time it's going to be really slow.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Mr.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
McKenna, do you have a second?

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I need to talk to you about something.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sure.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Liv, what can I do for you?

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, I was just wondering, you see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister is getting married and the wedding is overseas and, well...

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You want to take some time off, is that right?

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, sir, I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What dates are you planning on taking off?

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Would you be okay with that?

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I guess so.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A lot of non-native English speakers sometimes feel quite nervous about asking their boss for time off, hey?

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, I guess it's kind of a difficult subject.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah, but today we're going to teach you some great phrases that you can use next time you need to ask for some time off.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Great, so why don't we take a look at putting it together.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Putting it together.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay, so I'm putting it together today.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We're going to talk about some great phrases that you can use when approaching your boss.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, we heard Liv say this, do you have a second?

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you have a second?

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is a nice way to make sure your boss isn't busy when you want to ask him something.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Right, but we could also say this in two different ways.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's listen.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you have a minute?

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want to ask you something.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Do you have a sec?

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I need to talk to you.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A great way to approach your boss.

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, I love this phrase, do you have a sec?

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, do you have a sec?

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's really natural.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, so you've asked your boss for leave and you want to make sure that he agrees with you.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes, and this is how Liv did it.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Would you be okay with that?

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is a great pattern and we've got two other examples of how you can use it.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Example one.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Are you alright with that?

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Example two.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Will you be okay with this?

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Example three.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm fine with that.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay, great examples, great patterns, really useful language.

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue a third time.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Mr.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
McKenna, do you have a second?

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I need to talk to you about something.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Sure, Liv, what can I do for you?

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Well, I was just wondering, you see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister's getting married and the wedding is overseas and, well...

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You want to take some time off, is that right?

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, sir, I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What dates are you planning on taking off?

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Would you be okay with that?

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, I guess so.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I really noticed how Liv in this dialogue used a lot of really polite language, hey?

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, I guess when you're talking to your boss, you really have to be respectful and you have to use really polite language.

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What sort of things did she do to make herself seem more polite?

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, she said a couple of interesting phrases.

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
For example, well, I was just wondering.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, I was just wondering.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Right?

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, she's kind of setting up to ask for a favor or something.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And she also used another phrase that I thought was interesting.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, she also said, I was just hoping that, right?

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I was just hoping that maybe I could take some time off.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, again, that sort of doesn't sound too strong, so it seems a bit more polite.

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, because if she said, well, I want to take some time off, that's too strong.

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, so I was just hoping.

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And then, well, the boss says, okay, well, when do you want to leave?

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And she says, well, I was thinking of, right?

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was thinking of, again, if she would have said, I want to, too strong, right?

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah, in English, sometimes we are careful to not be too direct when we're asking for something, right?

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Right, yeah.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because if you're too direct, you sound a little bit impolite.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah, you sound rude.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay, so great tips and great things to take into consideration the next time you're talking into your boss.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
All right, guys, we're out of time, but thanks for listening.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And be sure to check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Right, where you can leave all your questions and comments and we'll be there to answer them.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But I guess until then, it's goodbye.
