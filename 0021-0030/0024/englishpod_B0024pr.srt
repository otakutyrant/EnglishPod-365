1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,620
Hello everyone, welcome back to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,540
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:07,639
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,519
And today we're going out to eat.

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:12,800
Yes, good thing too, because I'm hungry.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,279
I know, it's almost lunchtime.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,600
So today we're going to be talking about eating at a restaurant and giving some great recommendations and suggestions.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:27,940
Yes, we have language for describing food, for describing restaurants, and for making suggestions.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,300
Great, so let's start with our vocabulary preview for this lesson.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,100
Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,880
We have two words today from our dialogue, which you'll need to know to understand the dialogue.

12
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:40,539
Great.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,259
The first one that we have today is food poisoning.

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,759
Food poisoning.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,920
Food poisoning.

16
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,039
Food poisoning.

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,280
So food poisoning is?

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,899
Not a good thing.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,759
Not a good thing.

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,740
It is when you eat some bad food and that food makes you sick.

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,600
So you get food poisoning.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,840
Okay, so food poisoning, yeah, not a good thing.

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,140
Okay, the next word.

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:05,879
Allergic.

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,159
Allergic.

26
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,060
Allergic.

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,579
Allergic.

28
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,239
So when you're allergic to something.

29
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:14,700
It makes you sick.

30
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,200
That one thing makes you sick.

31
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:19,019
For example, I'm allergic to seafood.

32
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:19,859
Right.

33
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,239
If I eat seafood, I cannot breathe.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,439
Okay, so you definitely want to stay away from fish.

35
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:26,879
Yes.

36
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:27,560
Yes.

37
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:30,180
Some people are allergic to nuts, like peanuts.

38
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,340
Or maybe milk.

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,280
Yeah.

40
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:32,859
Cool.

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,400
So when one type of food makes you sick, you are allergic to that food.

42
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:38,920
Okay, great.

43
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,500
So with this in mind, now we can listen to our dialogue for the first time at its normal speed.

44
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,719
But don't worry if you don't get everything now because...

45
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,980
Welcome back, and teach you the important language.

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,000
Do you two have any plans for the evening?

47
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,060
We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neighbourhood.

48
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,599
Do you have any suggestions?

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,000
I know this really nice Italian place.

50
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,959
The food is fantastic and the decor is beautiful.

51
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,699
I'd recommend giving it a try.

52
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,319
Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food.

53
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,680
I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

54
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,219
In that case, I know a great little bistro.

55
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,560
They make a really tasty seafood platter.

56
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,219
The fish is outstanding.

57
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,120
It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so...

58
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,219
Okay, well, let me think.

59
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,520
Oh, I know this great little place.

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,120
It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches.

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,719
You've got to give them a try.

62
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,719
Ella, you took me there last time I visited, and I got food poisoning, remember?

63
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,099
Well, I'm getting hungry just thinking about all of those great restaurants.

64
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,719
Yeah, some really good recommendations, except for food poisoning, right?

65
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,840
No, not so good.

66
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,759
Let's start with our language takeaway for this lesson.

67
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,659
Our first word on language takeaway is check out.

68
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:10,039
Check out.

69
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,020
Check out.

70
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,500
So we have some great examples on how we can use check out in different situations, and then you can understand the meaning.

71
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,979
Have you been to the new cafe next door?

72
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,719
Yeah, I checked it out yesterday.

73
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,939
The food was great.

74
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,919
Hey, check out my new car.

75
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,439
I'm going to check out the new shopping mall this weekend.

76
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,360
So I can understand that it just means look at.

77
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,639
Yeah, look at, or yeah, or go see, so let's go check out that new bar in town.

78
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,080
Yeah, okay, cool.

79
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,659
Next word is bistro.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,439
Bistro.

81
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,360
Bistro.

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,219
So what's a bistro?

83
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,759
It's kind of complicated, but it's like a small restaurant that's not really cheap, though.

84
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,740
Not so cheap, but not so expensive.

85
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,419
And it's usually French.

86
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,579
Small, informal restaurant.

87
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,360
Bistro.

88
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,959
Okay, so our third phrase for today is not all that crazy about.

89
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,300
Not all that crazy about.

90
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,240
I'm not all that crazy about.

91
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,220
Okay.

92
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:38,100
Again, kind of a funny phrase, but we've got some examples that will help you understand the meaning.

93
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,980
Do you want to go shopping with me tomorrow?

94
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,420
I'm not all that crazy about shopping.

95
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,180
I don't like spending money.

96
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,139
Example two.

97
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,259
I'm not crazy about jazz music.

98
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,459
Can I change the song?

99
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,680
So this is just a really polite way of saying you don't like something.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,259
Exactly.

101
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:13,000
But now the opposite of bistro would be tasty.

102
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:13,920
Tasty.

103
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,720
That's our fourth word, tasty.

104
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:16,579
Tasty.

105
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,699
So when something is tasty, it's good.

106
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,319
It's good.

107
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,079
Like delicious.

108
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:21,759
Delicious.

109
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,860
Yeah, you know what, in English we almost never say the food is delicious.

110
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,959
But we always say it's really tasty.

111
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,319
Yes.

112
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,399
This is really tasty.

113
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:30,699
Yes.

114
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,259
Okay.

115
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:31,839
Tasty.

116
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,279
And our last phrase for language takeaway in the mood for.

117
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,319
In the mood for.

118
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,899
In the mood for.

119
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,439
Let's listen to some examples of this phrase and we'll understand the meaning a little bit better.

120
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,160
Example one.

121
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,540
We always eat hamburgers for dinner.

122
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,300
I'm in the mood for something different.

123
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,300
Example two.

124
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
Let's watch a movie.

125
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,060
How about Texas Chainsaw Massacre?

126
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,980
I am not in the mood for a horror movie.

127
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:16,000
So if I'm in the mood for something, I feel like doing or eating or watching.

128
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,540
Yeah, it means you want to do that now.

129
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:19,279
Yeah.

130
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,560
I'm in the mood for.

131
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,420
Okay.

132
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,600
Some great language we just looked at and I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time.

133
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,759
Do you two have any plans for the evening?

134
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,100
We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neighbourhood.

135
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,120
Do you have any suggestions?

136
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,220
I know this really nice Italian place.

137
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,839
The food is fantastic and the decor is beautiful.

138
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,399
I'd recommend giving it a try.

139
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:59,459
Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food.

140
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,779
I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

141
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,740
In that case, I know a great little bistro.

142
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,899
They make a really tasty seafood platter.

143
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,100
The fish is outstanding.

144
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:19,420
It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so...

145
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,800
Okay, well, let me think.

146
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,879
Oh, I know this great little place.

147
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,899
It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches.

148
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,100
You've got to give them a try.

149
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:40,500
Ella, you took me there last time I visited and I got food poisoning, remember?

150
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:50,139
Okay, some really great and useful phrases there and I know you want to talk about specifically some of these phrases.

151
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:54,720
Yes, today's lesson is all about making recommendations, right?

152
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:55,379
Right.

153
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,000
So let's look at some useful phrases in Fluency Builder.

154
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:05,300
Fluency Builder So in the dialogue, we heard a great way of asking for a suggestion.

155
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:05,959
That's right.

156
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:06,720
Let's listen.

157
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:08,899
Do you have any suggestions?

158
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,480
Do you have any suggestions?

159
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,860
So that's how you would ask for a suggestion or you can say something else like do you have any ideas?

160
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,939
Yeah, or you might say, do you have any thoughts?

161
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,639
Okay, so that's asking for suggestions.

162
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:26,000
Yep.

163
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,240
In response to this, you can say something like this.

164
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,340
I'd recommend giving it a try.

165
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,039
I'd recommend giving it a try.

166
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,759
We also heard another phrase that we use for giving suggestions.

167
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,240
You've got to give them a try.

168
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,100
You've got to give them a try.

169
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,080
So these two phrases are great.

170
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:53,159
I'd recommend or you got to give them a try.

171
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah.

172
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:55,419
Great ways of suggesting.

173
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:55,980
Yes.

174
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,980
Now, what's really important here is the pronunciation of these words, right?

175
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,179
Yeah, you'll notice that we don't say I would recommend.

176
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:05,919
Right.

177
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,980
We use the contraction I'd.

178
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:08,759
I'd.

179
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,360
I'd.

180
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,059
I'd recommend.

181
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,960
I'd recommend.

182
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,860
Similarly, in the phrase you have got to, we shorten that to say You gotta.

183
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,580
You gotta.

184
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,840
You gotta give them a try.

185
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,460
You gotta.

186
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:24,039
You know what, guys?

187
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:31,679
If you can shorten your phrases like this, if you can push the sounds together, you'll sound a lot more natural, hey?

188
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:38,799
And also you'll be able to understand because in movies or in shows they will never say you have got to give them a try.

189
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:43,320
So if you know how to use this form, you'll understand what they mean.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,080
Exactly.

191
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,259
Okay, great.

192
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,279
Well, why don't we listen to the dialogue a third time and you'll hear some of these contractions in the dialogue.

193
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:58,220
Do you two have any plans for the evening?

194
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,299
We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neighborhood.

195
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,799
Do you have any suggestions?

196
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,240
I know this really nice Italian place.

197
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,200
The food is fantastic and the decor is beautiful.

198
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,960
I'd recommend giving it a try.

199
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:13,539
Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food.

200
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,919
I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

201
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,460
In that case, I know a great little bistro.

202
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,799
They make a really tasty seafood platter.

203
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,460
The fish is outstanding.

204
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,399
It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so...

205
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,460
Okay, well, let me think.

206
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,759
Oh, I know this great little place.

207
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,399
It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches.

208
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:37,980
You've got to give them a try.

209
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,940
Ella, you took me there last time I visited and I got food poisoning, remember?

210
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,700
Okay, great dialogue.

211
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,000
Erica, I know that you have some food poisoning stories for us.

212
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,279
I don't know about stories, but I've definitely had food poisoning before.

213
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,779
One of the worst times that I ever had food poisoning was when I was traveling in Morocco.

214
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:13,399
I had some really amazing orange juice, really fresh squeezed that day in the morning, and then I got on a bus.

215
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,480
I think you can see where this is going.

216
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:30,500
Yeah, so I was on the bus and then I started to feel really sick and I was just hoping and hoping and hoping that the bus ride would be over soon, but unfortunately it wasn't.

217
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,419
Oh, no.

218
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,759
All I can say is that I was sick.

219
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,720
All I can say is that I was pretty sick and really, really unhappy.

220
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:41,919
Yeah, I bet.

221
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,700
Well, that's very strange that you got sick from orange juice, huh?

222
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,840
Well, yeah, maybe it was with some dirty water or something like that.

223
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,279
I don't know.

224
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,539
It was a terrible situation.

225
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,559
Yeah, it's always complicated when you're traveling to other countries.

226
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,480
It could be the water.

227
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:58,679
It could be the way they prepare things.

228
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,960
Yeah, yeah.

229
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,639
Food poisoning.

230
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,159
Guys, I hope that you don't get food poisoning.

231
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,399
And if you have any food poisoning stories, it would be great for you to share them.

232
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,600
Yes, at our website, EnglishPod.com.

233
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,500
And we'll see you there to answer all your questions and comments, but now we have to go.

234
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,019
Okay, guys, thanks for listening.

235
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,000
We'll see you there.

236
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,600
Bye-bye.

237
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:17,860
Bye.
