1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're going out to eat.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, good thing too, because I'm hungry.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I know, it's almost lunchtime.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So today we're going to be talking about eating at a restaurant and giving some great recommendations and suggestions.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes, we have language for describing food, for describing restaurants, and for making suggestions.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Great, so let's start with our vocabulary preview for this lesson.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We have two words today from our dialogue, which you'll need to know to understand the dialogue.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Great.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The first one that we have today is food poisoning.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Food poisoning.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Food poisoning.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Food poisoning.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So food poisoning is?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Not a good thing.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Not a good thing.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It is when you eat some bad food and that food makes you sick.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So you get food poisoning.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, so food poisoning, yeah, not a good thing.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay, the next word.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Allergic.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Allergic.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Allergic.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Allergic.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So when you're allergic to something.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It makes you sick.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That one thing makes you sick.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For example, I'm allergic to seafood.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Right.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If I eat seafood, I cannot breathe.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay, so you definitely want to stay away from fish.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Some people are allergic to nuts, like peanuts.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Or maybe milk.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Cool.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So when one type of food makes you sick, you are allergic to that food.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, great.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So with this in mind, now we can listen to our dialogue for the first time at its normal speed.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But don't worry if you don't get everything now because...

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Welcome back, and teach you the important language.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Do you two have any plans for the evening?

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neighbourhood.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you have any suggestions?

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I know this really nice Italian place.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The food is fantastic and the decor is beautiful.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'd recommend giving it a try.

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
In that case, I know a great little bistro.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
They make a really tasty seafood platter.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The fish is outstanding.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so...

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, well, let me think.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, I know this great little place.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You've got to give them a try.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Ella, you took me there last time I visited, and I got food poisoning, remember?

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, I'm getting hungry just thinking about all of those great restaurants.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, some really good recommendations, except for food poisoning, right?

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, not so good.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's start with our language takeaway for this lesson.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Our first word on language takeaway is check out.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Check out.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Check out.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So we have some great examples on how we can use check out in different situations, and then you can understand the meaning.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Have you been to the new cafe next door?

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, I checked it out yesterday.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The food was great.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hey, check out my new car.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm going to check out the new shopping mall this weekend.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So I can understand that it just means look at.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, look at, or yeah, or go see, so let's go check out that new bar in town.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, okay, cool.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Next word is bistro.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Bistro.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Bistro.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So what's a bistro?

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's kind of complicated, but it's like a small restaurant that's not really cheap, though.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Not so cheap, but not so expensive.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And it's usually French.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Small, informal restaurant.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Bistro.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, so our third phrase for today is not all that crazy about.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Not all that crazy about.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm not all that crazy about.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Again, kind of a funny phrase, but we've got some examples that will help you understand the meaning.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you want to go shopping with me tomorrow?

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not all that crazy about shopping.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't like spending money.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Example two.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm not crazy about jazz music.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Can I change the song?

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So this is just a really polite way of saying you don't like something.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Exactly.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But now the opposite of bistro would be tasty.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Tasty.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's our fourth word, tasty.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Tasty.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So when something is tasty, it's good.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's good.

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Like delicious.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Delicious.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, you know what, in English we almost never say the food is delicious.

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But we always say it's really tasty.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This is really tasty.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Tasty.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And our last phrase for language takeaway in the mood for.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In the mood for.

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
In the mood for.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's listen to some examples of this phrase and we'll understand the meaning a little bit better.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Example one.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We always eat hamburgers for dinner.

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm in the mood for something different.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Example two.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let's watch a movie.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How about Texas Chainsaw Massacre?

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I am not in the mood for a horror movie.

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So if I'm in the mood for something, I feel like doing or eating or watching.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, it means you want to do that now.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah.

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm in the mood for.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Some great language we just looked at and I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you two have any plans for the evening?

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neighbourhood.

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Do you have any suggestions?

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I know this really nice Italian place.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The food is fantastic and the decor is beautiful.

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'd recommend giving it a try.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
In that case, I know a great little bistro.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
They make a really tasty seafood platter.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The fish is outstanding.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so...

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay, well, let me think.

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, I know this great little place.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You've got to give them a try.

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ella, you took me there last time I visited and I got food poisoning, remember?

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay, some really great and useful phrases there and I know you want to talk about specifically some of these phrases.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes, today's lesson is all about making recommendations, right?

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Right.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So let's look at some useful phrases in Fluency Builder.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Fluency Builder So in the dialogue, we heard a great way of asking for a suggestion.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's right.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's listen.

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you have any suggestions?

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you have any suggestions?

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So that's how you would ask for a suggestion or you can say something else like do you have any ideas?

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, or you might say, do you have any thoughts?

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, so that's asking for suggestions.

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yep.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
In response to this, you can say something like this.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'd recommend giving it a try.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'd recommend giving it a try.

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We also heard another phrase that we use for giving suggestions.

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You've got to give them a try.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You've got to give them a try.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So these two phrases are great.

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'd recommend or you got to give them a try.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Great ways of suggesting.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Now, what's really important here is the pronunciation of these words, right?

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, you'll notice that we don't say I would recommend.

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right.

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We use the contraction I'd.

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'd.

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'd.

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'd recommend.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'd recommend.

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Similarly, in the phrase you have got to, we shorten that to say You gotta.

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You gotta.

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You gotta give them a try.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You gotta.

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You know what, guys?

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If you can shorten your phrases like this, if you can push the sounds together, you'll sound a lot more natural, hey?

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And also you'll be able to understand because in movies or in shows they will never say you have got to give them a try.

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So if you know how to use this form, you'll understand what they mean.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Exactly.

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, great.

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Well, why don't we listen to the dialogue a third time and you'll hear some of these contractions in the dialogue.

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Do you two have any plans for the evening?

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neighborhood.

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Do you have any suggestions?

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I know this really nice Italian place.

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The food is fantastic and the decor is beautiful.

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'd recommend giving it a try.

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food.

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
In that case, I know a great little bistro.

202
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They make a really tasty seafood platter.

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The fish is outstanding.

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so...

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay, well, let me think.

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh, I know this great little place.

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches.

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You've got to give them a try.

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Ella, you took me there last time I visited and I got food poisoning, remember?

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay, great dialogue.

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Erica, I know that you have some food poisoning stories for us.

212
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know about stories, but I've definitely had food poisoning before.

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
One of the worst times that I ever had food poisoning was when I was traveling in Morocco.

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I had some really amazing orange juice, really fresh squeezed that day in the morning, and then I got on a bus.

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think you can see where this is going.

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, so I was on the bus and then I started to feel really sick and I was just hoping and hoping and hoping that the bus ride would be over soon, but unfortunately it wasn't.

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh, no.

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
All I can say is that I was sick.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
All I can say is that I was pretty sick and really, really unhappy.

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, I bet.

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, that's very strange that you got sick from orange juice, huh?

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Well, yeah, maybe it was with some dirty water or something like that.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't know.

224
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It was a terrible situation.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, it's always complicated when you're traveling to other countries.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It could be the water.

227
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It could be the way they prepare things.

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah, yeah.

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Food poisoning.

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Guys, I hope that you don't get food poisoning.

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And if you have any food poisoning stories, it would be great for you to share them.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes, at our website, EnglishPod.com.

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And we'll see you there to answer all your questions and comments, but now we have to go.

234
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay, guys, thanks for listening.

235
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We'll see you there.

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Bye-bye.

237
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Bye.
