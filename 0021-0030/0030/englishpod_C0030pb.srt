00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Today we're bringing you part two of another great lesson that we had.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
New guy in town.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The new guy in town.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Part two.

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Part two.

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Kind of a creepy story.

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes.

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, and this one is also a little bit strange, a little bit weird.

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah, unusual outcome, unusual ending.

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But it has to do a lot with invitations.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right.

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So an invitation is when you ask somebody to do something with you.

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
A dinner invitation.

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So we're going to be talking about invitations and inviting people to do things.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, with that, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Don't you think so, Ellen?

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, yes, of course.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We'd love to come over.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Can I bring anything?

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't worry about it.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll take care of everything.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll see you tonight.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Come with an appetite.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I know I will.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He gives me the creeps.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Why on earth did you accept?

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Come on, Ellen.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It'll be nice to get to know him.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I guess so.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He always wrote me into things like this.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Ladies.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you for coming.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You look delicious.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I mean beautiful.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Please, come in.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, Armand, you are too kind.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How did I get myself into this?

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Wow, I'm really anxious to see what happens in this dinner party.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, I guess we'll have to stay tuned and find out.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
For part three.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Alright, well, we have some really great vocabularies so I guess we can start with language takeaway.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Alright, on language takeaway today we have three great words.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Erika, why don't you start us off with the first one.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The first word is thoughtful.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thoughtful.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thoughtful.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thoughtful.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So when you're thoughtful, you're kind, right?

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're kind, you're considerate to other people.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You think about what the other person would like.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Right.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And you do that thing.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's so thoughtful of you.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Our second phrase, give me the creeps.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Give me the creeps.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Give me the creeps.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is kind of a funny phrase, but I think if we listen to some examples we'll understand the meaning.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Example one.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Horror movies give me the creeps.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Example two.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Stop it.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're giving me the creeps.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Example three.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I saw this really scary clown.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It gave me the creeps.

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So I can see this one means to make me feel uncomfortable.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Right.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It makes me feel like scared.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Scared.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Also gives me the creeps.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And our last phrase for language takeaway, rope me into.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Rope me into something.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Rope me into something.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So if you rope me into something, it's...

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's like you convince me to do something that I don't really want to do.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So I roped you into lending me your car.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That was a bad idea.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That was a bad idea.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And you roped me into going out for beers after work.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, that was a great idea.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
All right.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So rope me into.

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Convince.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
All right.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So I guess we could listen to our dialogue again.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This time a little bit slower and you'll be able to understand the language a little bit more clearly.

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't you think so, Ellen?

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, yes, of course.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We'd love to come over.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Can I bring anything?

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, don't worry about it.

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll take care of everything.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll see you tonight.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Come with an appetite.

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I know I will.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He gives me the creeps.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why on earth did you accept?

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, come on, Ellen.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It would be nice to get to know him.

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I guess so.

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You always rope me into things like this.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Ladies, thank you for coming.

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You look delicious.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I mean, beautiful.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Please come in.

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Come in.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh, Armand, you are too kind.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How did I get myself into this?

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, I guess that's a lot more clear and with that we can start putting it together today.

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Putting it together.

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Today we've got three words and phrases that we want to show you how you can put together and use differently.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The first one is appetite.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Appetite.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Appetite.

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Appetite.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So, appetite is like a strong desire for food, right?

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Right, an appetite.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We've got some examples that show you how to use this phrase.

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's listen.

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Example one.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Mmm, dinner smells so good.

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's giving me an appetite.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Example two.

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're sure eating a lot.

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You must have a big appetite.

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Example three.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm getting sick.

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I have a fever and I've lost my appetite.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay, so we saw some great examples of appetite.

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You can lose your appetite.

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's right.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You have a big appetite.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A small appetite.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
A healthy appetite.

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Right.

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So it just means?

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A desire for food.

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A hunger for food.

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, great.

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's our second phrase for today?

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Get to know someone.

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Get to know.

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Get to know.

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So when you get to know someone is you talk to them and you find out what they do.

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, you get more familiar with them.

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
More familiar, right.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
For example, we can say, I got to know her in Spanish class and she's a really nice person.

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, or you can say, Armand, Ellen, and Doris got to know each other at a dinner party.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Right.

168
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Or you can say, If you get to know me, you'll see that I'm not a bad guy.

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's true.

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, get to know.

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And our third phrase is, Why on earth?

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why on earth?

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Why on earth?

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why on earth?

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is like a saying or expression.

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can use it in a lot of different ways.

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So we've got some examples for you.

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let's listen.

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Example one.

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Where on earth is my phone?

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Example two.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
How on earth did you learn English in one month?

183
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Example three.

184
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What on earth is it?

185
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So when you ask a question with on earth, so why on earth, how on earth, what on earth, it's like you're showing a lot of surprise.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay, great stuff.

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So let's just listen to our dialogue a third time.

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Don't you think so, Ellen?

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh, yes, of course.

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We'd love to come over.

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Can I bring anything?

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No, don't worry about it.

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll take care of everything.

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll see you tonight.

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Come with an appetite.

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I know I will.

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He gives me the creeps.

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why on earth did you accept?

202
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, come on, Ellen.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It'll be nice to get to know him.

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I guess so.

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You always wrote me into things like this.

207
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Ladies, thank you for coming.

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You look delicious.

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I mean beautiful.

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Please come in.

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, Armand, you are too kind.

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
How did I get myself into this?

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We want to know what you think happens next.

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, what happens in this dialogue next.

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So we want you to send us your idea of what happens next and we're going to choose the best one.

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's right, Marco and I will choose the best continuation of the story and we'll use that in part three of the new guy in town.

217
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's right.

218
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So you can give it any direction you want.

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's right.

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And of course we'll publish the name of the author with the lesson.

221
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm really anxious to see what ideas come up and how we can end this dialogue.

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I know we've got a lot of really creative users out there so I'm really looking forward to this.

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's right.

224
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's right.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So be sure to send us your ideas, either a private message or you can post it on the comments section of this lesson.

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And any other questions or doubts, go to EnglishPod.com and you can leave them there.

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes, Marco and I are always happy to answer your questions.

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Okay, folks.

229
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So until then, it's goodbye.
