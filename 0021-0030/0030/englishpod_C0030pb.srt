00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:03,140
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:04,700
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:05,480
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,360
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,800
Today we're bringing you part two of another great lesson that we had.

6
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:10,500
Yes.

7
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:11,859
New guy in town.

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,960
The new guy in town.

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,500
Part two.

10
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:14,119
Part two.

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,560
Kind of a creepy story.

12
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:15,939
Yes.

13
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,940
Yeah, and this one is also a little bit strange, a little bit weird.

14
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,260
Yeah, unusual outcome, unusual ending.

15
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,879
But it has to do a lot with invitations.

16
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:26,600
That's right.

17
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,019
So an invitation is when you ask somebody to do something with you.

18
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,880
A dinner invitation.

19
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,500
So we're going to be talking about invitations and inviting people to do things.

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,179
Well, with that, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,060
Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

22
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,799
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,320
Don't you think so, Ellen?

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,399
Oh, yes, of course.

25
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,719
We'd love to come over.

26
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,140
Can I bring anything?

27
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:00,560
No.

28
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:02,380
Don't worry about it.

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll take care of everything.

30
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:07,299
I'll see you tonight.

31
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,799
Come with an appetite.

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,060
I know I will.

33
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,400
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

34
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,819
He gives me the creeps.

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,760
Why on earth did you accept?

36
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:22,280
Come on, Ellen.

37
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,079
It'll be nice to get to know him.

38
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,000
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

39
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:30,620
I guess so.

40
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,519
He always wrote me into things like this.

41
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:46,920
Ladies.

42
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,620
Thank you for coming.

43
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,500
You look delicious.

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,459
I mean beautiful.

45
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,579
Please, come in.

46
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:03,219
Oh, Armand, you are too kind.

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,579
How did I get myself into this?

48
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,419
Wow, I'm really anxious to see what happens in this dinner party.

49
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:25,900
Yeah, I guess we'll have to stay tuned and find out.

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,759
For part three.

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,139
Alright, well, we have some really great vocabularies so I guess we can start with language takeaway.

52
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,699
Alright, on language takeaway today we have three great words.

53
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:43,199
Erika, why don't you start us off with the first one.

54
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,439
The first word is thoughtful.

55
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,400
Thoughtful.

56
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,259
Thoughtful.

57
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,560
Thoughtful.

58
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,180
So when you're thoughtful, you're kind, right?

59
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,460
You're kind, you're considerate to other people.

60
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,819
You think about what the other person would like.

61
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,300
Right.

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,120
And you do that thing.

63
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,539
It's so thoughtful of you.

64
00:02:59,900 --> 00:02:59,919
Yeah.

65
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,719
Our second phrase, give me the creeps.

66
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,639
Give me the creeps.

67
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,580
Give me the creeps.

68
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:12,080
This is kind of a funny phrase, but I think if we listen to some examples we'll understand the meaning.

69
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,280
Example one.

70
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,659
Horror movies give me the creeps.

71
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,259
Example two.

72
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,699
Stop it.

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,960
You're giving me the creeps.

74
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,180
Example three.

75
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,659
I saw this really scary clown.

76
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,759
It gave me the creeps.

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,099
So I can see this one means to make me feel uncomfortable.

78
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:44,819
Right.

79
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:47,539
It makes me feel like scared.

80
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,219
Scared.

81
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,860
Also gives me the creeps.

82
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,860
And our last phrase for language takeaway, rope me into.

83
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,979
Rope me into something.

84
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,479
Rope me into something.

85
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,699
So if you rope me into something, it's...

86
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,819
It's like you convince me to do something that I don't really want to do.

87
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:06,340
Right.

88
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,060
So I roped you into lending me your car.

89
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:10,620
Yes.

90
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,979
That was a bad idea.

91
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:12,900
That was a bad idea.

92
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,639
And you roped me into going out for beers after work.

93
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,160
Yeah, that was a great idea.

94
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,400
All right.

95
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,180
So rope me into.

96
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:21,740
Convince.

97
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,699
All right.

98
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,199
So I guess we could listen to our dialogue again.

99
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,420
This time a little bit slower and you'll be able to understand the language a little bit more clearly.

100
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

101
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,579
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

102
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,519
Don't you think so, Ellen?

103
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,860
Oh, yes, of course.

104
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,680
We'd love to come over.

105
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,259
Can I bring anything?

106
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:58,319
No, don't worry about it.

107
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,459
I'll take care of everything.

108
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,139
I'll see you tonight.

109
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,040
Come with an appetite.

110
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,819
I know I will.

111
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,560
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

112
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,399
He gives me the creeps.

113
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,779
Why on earth did you accept?

114
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,319
Oh, come on, Ellen.

115
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,740
It would be nice to get to know him.

116
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,379
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

117
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,439
I guess so.

118
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,879
You always rope me into things like this.

119
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,860
Ladies, thank you for coming.

120
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,519
You look delicious.

121
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,519
I mean, beautiful.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,019
Please come in.

123
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:41,819
Come in.

124
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,579
Oh, Armand, you are too kind.

125
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,420
How did I get myself into this?

126
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:58,879
Well, I guess that's a lot more clear and with that we can start putting it together today.

127
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,540
Putting it together.

128
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,339
Today we've got three words and phrases that we want to show you how you can put together and use differently.

129
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,180
The first one is appetite.

130
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:13,420
Appetite.

131
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:14,279
Appetite.

132
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:15,819
Appetite.

133
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,139
So, appetite is like a strong desire for food, right?

134
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,519
Right, an appetite.

135
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,180
We've got some examples that show you how to use this phrase.

136
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,319
Let's listen.

137
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,300
Example one.

138
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,879
Mmm, dinner smells so good.

139
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,980
It's giving me an appetite.

140
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,420
Example two.

141
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,019
You're sure eating a lot.

142
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,000
You must have a big appetite.

143
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:47,620
Example three.

144
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:51,939
I'm getting sick.

145
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,579
I have a fever and I've lost my appetite.

146
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,899
Okay, so we saw some great examples of appetite.

147
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,399
You can lose your appetite.

148
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:02,959
That's right.

149
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,680
You have a big appetite.

150
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,259
A small appetite.

151
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
A healthy appetite.

152
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:08,100
Right.

153
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,540
So it just means?

154
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,939
A desire for food.

155
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,120
A hunger for food.

156
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,360
Yeah.

157
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,620
Okay, great.

158
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,220
What's our second phrase for today?

159
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,660
Get to know someone.

160
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,779
Get to know.

161
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,000
Get to know.

162
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,620
So when you get to know someone is you talk to them and you find out what they do.

163
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,920
Yeah, you get more familiar with them.

164
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,259
More familiar, right.

165
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:34,639
For example, we can say, I got to know her in Spanish class and she's a really nice person.

166
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,600
Yeah, or you can say, Armand, Ellen, and Doris got to know each other at a dinner party.

167
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:41,139
Right.

168
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,720
Or you can say, If you get to know me, you'll see that I'm not a bad guy.

169
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,420
That's true.

170
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,899
Okay, get to know.

171
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,259
And our third phrase is, Why on earth?

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,980
Why on earth?

173
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,300
Why on earth?

174
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,180
Why on earth?

175
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,660
This is like a saying or expression.

176
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:01,560
You can use it in a lot of different ways.

177
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,319
So we've got some examples for you.

178
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,259
Let's listen.

179
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,220
Example one.

180
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,160
Where on earth is my phone?

181
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,399
Example two.

182
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,079
How on earth did you learn English in one month?

183
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,040
Example three.

184
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:32,019
What on earth is it?

185
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:42,399
So when you ask a question with on earth, so why on earth, how on earth, what on earth, it's like you're showing a lot of surprise.

186
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,639
Okay, great stuff.

187
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,220
So let's just listen to our dialogue a third time.

188
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,379
Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

189
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,139
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

190
00:08:58,659 --> 00:08:59,639
Don't you think so, Ellen?

191
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,720
Oh, yes, of course.

192
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,019
We'd love to come over.

193
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:04,440
Can I bring anything?

194
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,720
No, don't worry about it.

195
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:08,320
I'll take care of everything.

196
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:11,639
I'll see you tonight.

197
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,139
Come with an appetite.

198
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,360
I know I will.

199
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,740
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

200
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:23,139
He gives me the creeps.

201
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,100
Why on earth did you accept?

202
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,620
Oh, come on, Ellen.

203
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,399
It'll be nice to get to know him.

204
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,320
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

205
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,940
I guess so.

206
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,279
You always wrote me into things like this.

207
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,940
Ladies, thank you for coming.

208
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,139
You look delicious.

209
00:09:58,779 --> 00:09:59,779
I mean beautiful.

210
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,700
Please come in.

211
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,500
Oh, Armand, you are too kind.

212
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:09,879
How did I get myself into this?

213
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,899
We want to know what you think happens next.

214
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,620
Yes, what happens in this dialogue next.

215
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,379
So we want you to send us your idea of what happens next and we're going to choose the best one.

216
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:44,340
That's right, Marco and I will choose the best continuation of the story and we'll use that in part three of the new guy in town.

217
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:45,080
That's right.

218
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,799
So you can give it any direction you want.

219
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,320
That's right.

220
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,919
And of course we'll publish the name of the author with the lesson.

221
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,019
I'm really anxious to see what ideas come up and how we can end this dialogue.

222
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,759
I know we've got a lot of really creative users out there so I'm really looking forward to this.

223
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,360
That's right.

224
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,840
That's right.

225
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:11,340
So be sure to send us your ideas, either a private message or you can post it on the comments section of this lesson.

226
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,240
And any other questions or doubts, go to EnglishPod.com and you can leave them there.

227
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,919
Yes, Marco and I are always happy to answer your questions.

228
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,159
Okay, folks.

229
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,799
So until then, it's goodbye.
