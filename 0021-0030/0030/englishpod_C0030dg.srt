00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:36,759
EnglishPod.com I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

2
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,140
He gives me the creeps.

3
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,100
Why on earth did you accept?

4
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,619
Well, come on, Ellen.

5
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,420
It'll be nice to get to know him.

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,340
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

7
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,960
I guess so.

8
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,399
You always wrote me into things like this.

9
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,280
Ladies.

10
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,939
Thank you for coming.

11
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,140
You look delicious.

12
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,799
I mean beautiful.

13
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,719
Please, come in.

14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,540
Oh, Arwand, you are too kind.

15
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:24,900
How did I get myself into this?

16
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,060
