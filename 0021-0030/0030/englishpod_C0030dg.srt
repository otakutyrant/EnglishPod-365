00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:36,000
EnglishPod.com I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He gives me the creeps.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why on earth did you accept?

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, come on, Ellen.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It'll be nice to get to know him.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I guess so.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You always wrote me into things like this.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Ladies.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Thank you for coming.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You look delicious.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I mean beautiful.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Please, come in.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, Arwand, you are too kind.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How did I get myself into this?

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
