1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello English learners, welcome to another great lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So Erica, how are you today?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm doing pretty well.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And I think we've got a good lesson today, a really helpful lesson.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What are we talking about today?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We have an elementary lesson about making an appointment.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All right, making an appointment.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, that's really helpful.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I guess you have to make appointments for the doctor or at work, maybe, or with your friends.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So this is language that you can use every day to make appointments.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, so why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We only have one word today, which you need to know to understand this dialogue.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And it is financial advisor.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Financial advisor.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Financial advisor.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So what is a financial advisor?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A financial advisor is a person who gives suggestions or recommendations about investing money.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Someone who wants you to put money in the stock market.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, great.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I guess we're ready now to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And as always, it's going to be at a normal speed, but you don't have to worry about it because...

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We'll come back and teach you all the important words.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hello, Fairbrook Consulting.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How may I help you?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, this is Julianne Horton, and I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
McNeely.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Certainly.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What day were you thinking of?

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How's Thursday?

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Does she have any time available then?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Um, let me double check.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Unfortunately she's booked solid on Thursday.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How does next Monday work for you?

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Can she do Tuesday?

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sure.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Tuesday's perfect.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
May I ask where you're calling from?

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Sure.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Merton Financial Advisors.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Actually, Tuesday's no good.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Sorry about that.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, I guess Ms.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
McNeely does not want to speak to any financial advisors.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, I guess she doesn't really want to invest in the stock market, huh?

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Or maybe she just gets too many phone calls from them.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you have money, I guess you'll get phone calls from people like that.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I guess we don't have that problem, hey?

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, we don't.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay, let's start with our language takeaway for today.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So four words today.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The first one is available.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Available.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Available.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Available.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Meaning?

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That you are not busy.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That you're free.

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're free.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're not busy.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Exactly.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's move to our next word.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Double check.

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Double check.

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Double check.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Double check.

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I think we've got some examples of this phrase.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Example one.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Do you have the tickets?

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I think so, but let me just double check.

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Example two.

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I thought I sent that email already, but let me double check.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, so double check basically means to check something twice.

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Exactly, to check it again.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Check it again.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Our third word for language takeaway today is scheduled.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Scheduled.

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Scheduled.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Scheduled.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
S-C-H-E-D-U-L-E.

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Scheduled.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Scheduled.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So when you have something scheduled, it means that you have something planned, right?

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Or booked at that time.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Booked at that time.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, we've got a lunch scheduled this afternoon, don't we?

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes, we do.

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
All right.

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
A great lunch.

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Looking forward to it.

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And our last word for today is booked solid.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Booked solid.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Booked solid.

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
B-O-O-K-E-D.

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Booked solid.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So we have some great examples on how you can use this great phrase, booked solid, and you can understand what it means.

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Example one.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I can't get a hotel room.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They're booked solid until after the new year.

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Example two.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sorry, there are no seats available on these flights.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We booked solid over the Christmas holidays.

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Example three.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Sorry, I can't meet with you today.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm booked solid.

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, great.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So booked solid basically is?

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have no free time, no available time.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Right.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So you've got appointments scheduled all day.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
All day, great.

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So with this in mind, now we can listen to our dialogue a second time.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This time it's going to be slow so we can understand a little bit better.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hello, Fairbrook Consulting.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
How may I help you?

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes, this is Julianne Horton and I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms.

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
McNeely.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Certainly.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What date were you thinking of?

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How's Thursday?

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Does she have any time available then?

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let me double-check.

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No, unfortunately she's booked solid on Thursday.

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
How does next Monday work for you?

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday.

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Can she do Tuesday?

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sure, Tuesday's perfect.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
May I ask where you're calling from?

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sure.

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Merton Financial Advisors.

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, actually Tuesday's no good.

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Sorry about that.

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, so now it's a little bit more clear and with this we can start with putting it together.

141
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Putting it together.

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There's some great examples in this dialogue of phrases you can use when you need to schedule an appointment.

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And we're going to look at those today.

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
In the dialogue, we heard Julianne ask about making an appointment and she said this.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms.

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
McNeely.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
McNeely.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So this is a great way to schedule an appointment, to ask for some time from somebody else.

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And we have some more examples of this phrase.

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Example one, please book an appointment for next week.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Example two, please schedule an appointment for next week.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Great, so after that when you're scheduling an appointment, you need to suggest a day when maybe that person has time.

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, let's listen to what they said in the dialogue.

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How's Thursday?

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Does she have any time available then?

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
How's Thursday?

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Does she have any time available then?

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You say, well, how's Thursday or how's Tuesday?

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And maybe that person doesn't have time that day so they'll say something like this.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Can she do Tuesday?

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Can she do Tuesday?

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay, Erica, so if I want to have a meeting with you, I would say, how's Monday sound?

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Or how's Monday?

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Monday's no good.

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm busy all day.

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How's Tuesday?

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Sorry, Tuesday's no good either.

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What about Wednesday?

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, Wednesday works.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
All right, great.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wednesday's perfect.

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay, great, so we have a meeting on Wednesday.

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay, yeah, those are some great phrases, hey, for scheduling an appointment.

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, they're really good.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, so now we can listen to our dialogue a third time and we're ready to understand everything that we've just talked about.

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Hello, Fairbrook Consulting.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How may I help you?

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes, this is Julianne Horton and I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
McNeely.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Certainly.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What day were you thinking of?

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
How's Thursday?

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Does she have any time available then?

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let me double check.

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Unfortunately, she's booked solid on Thursday.

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
How does next Monday work for you?

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday.

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Can she do Tuesday?

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Sure, Tuesday's perfect.

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
May I ask where you're calling from?

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Sure, Merton Financial Advisors.

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, actually Tuesday's no good.

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Sorry about that.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The language in this dialogue is really useful, isn't it, Marco?

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, it's from an everyday situation.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You always have to make appointments at some point.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes, and like we said earlier, it's language you can use when you need to talk about work with your boss maybe or when you need to do daily things like go to the doctor or even when you're planning something with your friends.

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You can use this in all those situations.

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,000
In all situations.

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Great.

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, we're out of time now, but I hope you enjoyed our lesson and found it useful.
