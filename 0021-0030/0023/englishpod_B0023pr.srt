00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,620
Hello English learners, welcome to another great lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,719
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,980
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:09,939
So Erica, how are you today?

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:11,019
I'm doing pretty well.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,779
And I think we've got a good lesson today, a really helpful lesson.

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,059
What are we talking about today?

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,039
We have an elementary lesson about making an appointment.

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,719
All right, making an appointment.

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:22,960
Yeah, that's really helpful.

11
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:29,140
I guess you have to make appointments for the doctor or at work, maybe, or with your friends.

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,379
Yeah.

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,299
So this is language that you can use every day to make appointments.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,359
Well, so why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,420
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:46,920
We only have one word today, which you need to know to understand this dialogue.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,859
And it is financial advisor.

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,799
Financial advisor.

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,960
Financial advisor.

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,820
So what is a financial advisor?

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:05,939
A financial advisor is a person who gives suggestions or recommendations about investing money.

22
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:09,719
Someone who wants you to put money in the stock market.

23
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,019
Okay, great.

24
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,040
I guess we're ready now to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,140
And as always, it's going to be at a normal speed, but you don't have to worry about it because...

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,060
We'll come back and teach you all the important words.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,560
Hello, Fairbrook Consulting.

28
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:33,680
How may I help you?

29
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,159
Yes, this is Julianne Horton, and I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms.

30
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,599
McNeely.

31
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:39,700
Certainly.

32
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,000
What day were you thinking of?

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,219
How's Thursday?

34
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,980
Does she have any time available then?

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,439
Um, let me double check.

36
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,659
Unfortunately she's booked solid on Thursday.

37
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,120
How does next Monday work for you?

38
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,400
Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday.

39
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,799
Can she do Tuesday?

40
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:54,980
Sure.

41
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,939
Tuesday's perfect.

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,340
May I ask where you're calling from?

43
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:58,959
Sure.

44
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,719
Merton Financial Advisors.

45
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,519
Oh.

46
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,980
Actually, Tuesday's no good.

47
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,379
Sorry about that.

48
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,979
Well, I guess Ms.

49
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,099
McNeely does not want to speak to any financial advisors.

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,479
Yeah, I guess she doesn't really want to invest in the stock market, huh?

51
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:22,080
Or maybe she just gets too many phone calls from them.

52
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,800
Yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,919
If you have money, I guess you'll get phone calls from people like that.

54
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,680
I guess we don't have that problem, hey?

55
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,860
No, we don't.

56
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,599
Okay, let's start with our language takeaway for today.

57
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,520
So four words today.

58
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,180
The first one is available.

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,259
Available.

60
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,080
Available.

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,319
Available.

62
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,060
Meaning?

63
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,580
That you are not busy.

64
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,340
That you're free.

65
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:48,879
You're free.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,580
You're not busy.

67
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,379
Exactly.

68
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's move to our next word.

69
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,240
Double check.

70
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,479
Double check.

71
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:55,879
Double check.

72
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:57,400
Double check.

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,360
I think we've got some examples of this phrase.

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
Example one.

75
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,240
Do you have the tickets?

76
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,860
I think so, but let me just double check.

77
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,180
Example two.

78
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,699
I thought I sent that email already, but let me double check.

79
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,900
Okay, so double check basically means to check something twice.

80
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:31,500
Exactly, to check it again.

81
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,159
Check it again.

82
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:32,740
Okay.

83
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,979
Our third word for language takeaway today is scheduled.

84
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:38,539
Scheduled.

85
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,400
Scheduled.

86
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:40,960
Scheduled.

87
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,159
S-C-H-E-D-U-L-E.

88
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,360
Scheduled.

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,080
Scheduled.

90
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,439
So when you have something scheduled, it means that you have something planned, right?

91
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,879
Or booked at that time.

92
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,699
Booked at that time.

93
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,580
Yeah, we've got a lunch scheduled this afternoon, don't we?

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,520
Yes, we do.

95
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,099
All right.

96
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,639
A great lunch.

97
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:00,819
Looking forward to it.

98
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,819
And our last word for today is booked solid.

99
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,539
Booked solid.

100
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,780
Booked solid.

101
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,780
B-O-O-K-E-D.

102
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,919
Booked solid.

103
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,540
So we have some great examples on how you can use this great phrase, booked solid, and you can understand what it means.

104
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,379
Example one.

105
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,100
I can't get a hotel room.

106
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,839
They're booked solid until after the new year.

107
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,459
Example two.

108
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm sorry, there are no seats available on these flights.

109
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,740
We booked solid over the Christmas holidays.

110
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:44,339
Example three.

111
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,779
Sorry, I can't meet with you today.

112
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,199
I'm booked solid.

113
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:55,540
Okay, great.

114
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
So booked solid basically is?

115
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,779
You have no free time, no available time.

116
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,600
Right.

117
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,800
So you've got appointments scheduled all day.

118
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,660
All day, great.

119
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,980
So with this in mind, now we can listen to our dialogue a second time.

120
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,959
This time it's going to be slow so we can understand a little bit better.

121
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,699
Hello, Fairbrook Consulting.

122
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,379
How may I help you?

123
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,139
Yes, this is Julianne Horton and I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms.

124
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:30,660
McNeely.

125
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:31,980
Certainly.

126
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,279
What date were you thinking of?

127
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,800
How's Thursday?

128
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,319
Does she have any time available then?

129
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,220
Let me double-check.

130
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,779
No, unfortunately she's booked solid on Thursday.

131
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,300
How does next Monday work for you?

132
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,420
Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday.

133
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:55,620
Can she do Tuesday?

134
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,579
Sure, Tuesday's perfect.

135
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,279
May I ask where you're calling from?

136
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,160
Sure.

137
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,839
Merton Financial Advisors.

138
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,459
Oh, actually Tuesday's no good.

139
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,959
Sorry about that.

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,339
Okay, so now it's a little bit more clear and with this we can start with putting it together.

141
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:22,680
Putting it together.

142
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:30,819
There's some great examples in this dialogue of phrases you can use when you need to schedule an appointment.

143
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:33,019
And we're going to look at those today.

144
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,899
In the dialogue, we heard Julianne ask about making an appointment and she said this.

145
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms.

146
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:44,259
McNeely.

147
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,620
I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms.

148
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,120
McNeely.

149
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,319
So this is a great way to schedule an appointment, to ask for some time from somebody else.

150
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,480
And we have some more examples of this phrase.

151
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,319
Example one, please book an appointment for next week.

152
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,160
Example two, please schedule an appointment for next week.

153
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:21,259
Great, so after that when you're scheduling an appointment, you need to suggest a day when maybe that person has time.

154
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,060
Yes, let's listen to what they said in the dialogue.

155
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:26,660
How's Thursday?

156
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,480
Does she have any time available then?

157
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,500
How's Thursday?

158
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,259
Does she have any time available then?

159
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,660
You say, well, how's Thursday or how's Tuesday?

160
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:42,079
And maybe that person doesn't have time that day so they'll say something like this.

161
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,980
Can she do Tuesday?

162
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,000
Can she do Tuesday?

163
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,740
Okay, Erica, so if I want to have a meeting with you, I would say, how's Monday sound?

164
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,740
Or how's Monday?

165
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,100
Monday's no good.

166
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,879
I'm busy all day.

167
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,139
How's Tuesday?

168
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,839
Sorry, Tuesday's no good either.

169
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,420
What about Wednesday?

170
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,319
Okay, Wednesday works.

171
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,300
All right, great.

172
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,560
Wednesday's perfect.

173
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,279
Okay, great, so we have a meeting on Wednesday.

174
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,620
Okay, yeah, those are some great phrases, hey, for scheduling an appointment.

175
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:15,720
Yeah, they're really good.

176
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, so now we can listen to our dialogue a third time and we're ready to understand everything that we've just talked about.

177
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,799
Hello, Fairbrook Consulting.

178
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,879
How may I help you?

179
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,379
Yes, this is Julianne Horton and I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms.

180
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,820
McNeely.

181
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:40,919
Certainly.

182
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,220
What day were you thinking of?

183
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,440
How's Thursday?

184
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,179
Does she have any time available then?

185
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,679
Let me double check.

186
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,879
Unfortunately, she's booked solid on Thursday.

187
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:51,320
How does next Monday work for you?

188
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,620
Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday.

189
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,019
Can she do Tuesday?

190
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,159
Sure, Tuesday's perfect.

191
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,519
May I ask where you're calling from?

192
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,940
Sure, Merton Financial Advisors.

193
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
Oh, actually Tuesday's no good.

194
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,700
Sorry about that.

195
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,960
The language in this dialogue is really useful, isn't it, Marco?

196
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,500
Yeah, it's from an everyday situation.

197
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,080
You always have to make appointments at some point.

198
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:34,440
Yes, and like we said earlier, it's language you can use when you need to talk about work with your boss maybe or when you need to do daily things like go to the doctor or even when you're planning something with your friends.

199
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:37,220
You can use this in all those situations.

200
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,759
In all situations.

201
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:38,820
Great.

202
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,500
Well, we're out of time now, but I hope you enjoyed our lesson and found it useful.
