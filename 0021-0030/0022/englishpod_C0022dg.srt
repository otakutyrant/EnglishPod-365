00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:34,000
EnglishPod.com It's Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to deliver.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Where's your Christmas spirit?

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What'll happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts in their stockings?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sorry buddy, you were parked in a no-parking zone.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You were speeding AND you have no ID.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh's been impounded and those reindeer were taken to the city zoo.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is unbelievable.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What's this world coming to?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Christmas is ruined!

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What's that up ahead?

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It looks like...

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Elves!

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Whoa!

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They're shooting candy canes!

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Mayday!

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Mayday!

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're under heavy attack!

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We need backup!

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thanks for watching!
