EnglishPod.com It's Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to deliver.

2
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,100
Where's your Christmas spirit?

3
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,719
What'll happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts in their stockings?

4
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Sorry buddy, you were parked in a no-parking zone.

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,719
You were speeding AND you have no ID.

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,679
Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh's been impounded and those reindeer were taken to the city zoo.

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,140
What?

8
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,340
This is unbelievable.

9
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,979
What's this world coming to?

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,880
Christmas is ruined!

11
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,299
What's that up ahead?

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,680
It looks like...

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:06,920
Elves!

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,359
Whoa!

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,540
They're shooting candy canes!

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:10,659
Mayday!

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,099
Mayday!

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,060
We're under heavy attack!

19
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,859
We need backup!

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:24,939
Thanks for watching!
