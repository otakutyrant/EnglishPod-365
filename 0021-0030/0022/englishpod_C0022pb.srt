00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,099
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,200
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:10,359
And today we're bringing you the second part of Christmas Chronicles.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,500
Another Christmas lesson to get you in the Christmas spirit.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,300
Christmas and useful language for all of our listeners today.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,140
That's right.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,940
In today's lesson, we'll be learning some great Christmas vocabulary.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,000
And police-related vocabulary as well.

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,879
Now, Christmas, police vocabulary, how exactly does that fit together?

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,659
Well, they don't.

12
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,280
But here at EnglishPod, we can make anything happen.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,780
So that's why we have done this.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,659
To be creative.

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,619
To be creative.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,060
So let's take a look at our vocabulary preview for this lesson.

17
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,079
Vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,259
In today's vocabulary preview, we've got two words from our dialogue that you will need to know to understand this dialogue.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,179
The first one is elves, elves, elves, elves, and this is the plural of the word elf elf, right?

20
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:09,959
So elves are little people, little people with pointy hats with pointy hats, census helpers.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,200
Okay, so elves, elves.

22
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,780
Our next word is candy cane.

23
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,079
Candy cane.

24
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,299
Candy cane.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,420
Candy cane.

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,099
So a candy cane is a traditional Christmas candy, right?

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,640
Yes, it's red and white.

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,079
And kind of shaped like a like a J?

29
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,319
Like a J, yeah.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
Okay, so it's very traditional.

31
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:33,359
Yeah, you hang them on the tree and you eat them at Christmas time.

32
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:33,620
Yes.

33
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,640
Tastes like peppermint.

34
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,739
Okay, well, I guess we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

35
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,879
And it's gonna be kind of fast, but...

36
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,500
Don't worry if you don't understand everything, because we'll come back and talk about some of the language later.

37
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:58,280
Really fellas, you can't take me to jail.

38
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:00,079
Don't you know who I am?

39
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,719
Chris Kringle, you know.

40
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,180
Papa haven't we, Joe?

41
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,699
Yeah, last week we booked this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy.

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,979
Can you believe that?

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,060
It's Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to deliver.

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,319
Where's your Christmas spirit?

45
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,919
What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts on their stockings?

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,139
Sorry buddy, you were parked in a no parking zone.

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,939
You were speeding and you have no ID.

48
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,960
Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh's been impounded and those reindeer were taken to the city zoo.

49
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,379
What?

50
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,539
This is unbelievable.

51
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,159
What's this world coming to?

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,099
Christmas is ruined.

53
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,520
What's that up ahead?

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,180
It looks like elves.

55
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,900
Whoa, they're shooting candy canes.

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,259
Mayday, Mayday, we're under heavy attack.

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,080
We need backup.

58
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,939
Okay, so Santa has escaped from the police car, eh?

59
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,780
Thank God.

60
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:16,939
It's like a war over there.

61
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,680
They were really firing everything.

62
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:22,340
I know, I mean those elves are aggressive.

63
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,599
Very aggressive.

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,740
Okay, well we can take a look at some great vocabulary from this dialogue.

65
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,219
Why don't we start with our language takeaway for today.

66
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,439
Language takeaway.

67
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:43,219
In today's language takeaway, we have five really important words that we hope you will take away from the lesson.

68
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,120
Exactly, and the first word that we have today is booked.

69
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,419
Booked.

70
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,539
Booked.

71
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,819
Booked is another way of saying arrested.

72
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,580
Arrested.

73
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,020
Yeah, it's a slang word, hey?

74
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,580
It's kind of slang, yeah.

75
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,139
Yeah, it's a slang word, booked.

76
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,419
Okay, next word, speeding.

77
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,199
Speeding.

78
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:02,120
Speeding.

79
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,439
Speeding.

80
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:07,319
So Santa was speeding because he was going too fast.

81
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,479
Driving too fast, yeah.

82
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,219
Going over the speed limit.

83
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:10,860
Exactly.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,400
Third word today is impounded.

85
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,060
Impounded.

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,639
Impounded.

87
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:20,079
That's when your car gets arrested.

88
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,639
Your car gets arrested.

89
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,879
Yeah, they take your car to car jail.

90
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,699
Okay, so my car is in car jail.

91
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,000
I think I understand.

92
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,160
It's impounded.

93
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,220
Okay, so the police take my car and I have to pay to get it out.

94
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,019
Okay, let's move to our next word, ruined.

95
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,480
Ruined.

96
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,720
Ruined.

97
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,019
Ruined.

98
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,100
We have a few examples for us to listen to to understand the meaning of this word.

99
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,100
Example one.

100
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,279
It's been raining for five days.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,620
Our vacation is ruined.

102
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:01,379
Example two.

103
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,019
Look at this hole.

104
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:09,139
You've ruined my favorite pair of jeans.

105
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,819
Example three.

106
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:19,540
Sam, you've been caught stealing from the company.

107
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,500
Your chances for a promotion are ruined.

108
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,060
Okay, great examples and basically ruined means destroyed.

109
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:30,800
Destroyed.

110
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,480
Yeah, messed up.

111
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,060
Messed up.

112
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,540
Okay, now for our last word, back up.

113
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,120
Back up.

114
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,660
So now for our last word.

115
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:46,980
Okay, so now for our last word and language takeaway, back up.

116
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,720
Back up.

117
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:48,639
Back up.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,480
Back up.

119
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,620
So back up is help.

120
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Help.

121
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:52,839
Yeah, right.

122
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,660
So when you call for back up, you call for help.

123
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:59,079
Yeah, you see it all the time in war movies, police call for backup.

124
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,480
Yeah.

125
00:05:59,639 --> 00:05:59,899
Right.

126
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,060
I think though, it's important to point out that here, the pronunciation and stress of this phrase is really important.

127
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,100
Hey, yes, yes.

128
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,180
You have to say back up.

129
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:10,800
Back up.

130
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,439
Back up.

131
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:11,800
Yeah.

132
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,939
So both words are stressed at about the same level.

133
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:16,519
Hey, back up.

134
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,980
Because if you were to say back up, that means to move back.

135
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,600
Exactly.

136
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,519
Yeah, it's different.

137
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,879
So back up, back up.

138
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,259
Yes, the stress is important stress.

139
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,079
All right.

140
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,800
Well, you know what, I think with those words in mind, it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time.

141
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,879
Really, fellas, you can't take me to jail.

142
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,420
Don't you know who I am?

143
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:53,259
Chris Kringle, you know, Papa Noel, Per Noel, Baba Natale, Shung Da La Ren.

144
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,740
Yeah, yeah, we've heard that one before, haven't we, Joe?

145
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,560
Yeah.

146
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,339
Last week, we booked this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy.

147
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Can you believe that?

148
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,839
It's Christmas Eve, and I have all these presents to deliver.

149
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,180
Where's your Christmas spirit?

150
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,579
What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts in their stockings?

151
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:27,199
Sorry, buddy, you were parked in a no parking zone, you were speeding, and you have no ID.

152
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:35,779
Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh has been impounded and those reindeer were taken to the city zoo.

153
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,379
What?

154
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,199
This is unbelievable.

155
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,920
What's the world coming to?

156
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,879
Christmas is ruined.

157
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,379
What's that up ahead?

158
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,800
It looks like elves.

159
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,680
Whoa, they're shooting candy canes.

160
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,339
Mayday!

161
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,279
Mayday!

162
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,100
We are under heavy attack.

163
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,399
We need backup.

164
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,879
Okay, so without the sound effects and without any noise, I think it's much more clear now, right?

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,139
A little less dramatic.

166
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,639
Less dramatic, but good language.

167
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:17,839
Yes, speaking of good language, there's some great phrases I want to look at in this dialogue, and so let's do that in Putting It Together.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,939
Putting it together.

169
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:29,240
We have two phrases in Putting It Together that we want to show you how you can use in many different situations.

170
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,899
In the dialogue, we heard this.

171
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,200
Last week, we booked this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy.

172
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,940
Last week, we booked this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy.

173
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:45,340
So when you claim to be something, you're saying that you are something, but it might not be true, right?

174
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:50,039
Right, so for example, you can say, this woman claimed to be your wife.

175
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,100
But she's not.

176
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:51,759
But she's not.

177
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,100
Okay, we have a few other examples of how you can use the phrase claim to.

178
00:08:58,659 --> 00:08:59,539
Example one.

179
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,600
Daniel claimed to be the son of a government minister, but later we found out that he was lying.

180
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,180
Example two.

181
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,820
The criminals came to have a gun.

182
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,179
Example three.

183
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,639
This man here is claiming to know your father.

184
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,240
That's such a great phrase.

185
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:39,659
Just by putting it together with another verb, means something different, but still expresses that same idea.

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,559
Right, claimed to have, she claimed to have a baby or something.

187
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Yeah.

188
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,440
Okay.

189
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,559
Okay, so let's move to our next phrase.

190
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,000
Under heavy.

191
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,700
Under heavy.

192
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,379
Under heavy.

193
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,620
So in the dialogue, they said we're under heavy attack.

194
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,299
Right.

195
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:58,679
You can also use this phrase in a couple of other ways.

196
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,500
Example one.

197
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,179
We're in the heavy attack.

198
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,480
Example two.

199
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,740
We're under heavy fire.

200
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,539
Example three.

201
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,799
The prime minister is in the heavy security.

202
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:28,019
So if you're under heavy fire means that there's a lot of fire, like gunfire, gunfire.

203
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,659
Yeah, not like fire, fire.

204
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:30,259
Yeah.

205
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,240
Okay.

206
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,139
And if you're under heavy security.

207
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,179
It means that you have a lot of security, a lot of bodyguards or a lot of.

208
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:38,940
Right.

209
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,779
Like a prime minister, a president will be under heavy security.

210
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,259
Exactly.

211
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:42,820
Okay.

212
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,600
A couple of great phrases.

213
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:45,960
Really good phrases.

214
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,039
And with this, we can listen to our dialogue a third time.

215
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:10,639
Yeah.

216
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:10,940
Yeah.

217
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:12,299
We've heard that one before.

218
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,179
Haven't we, Joe?

219
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,220
Yeah.

220
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,720
Last week we booked this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy.

221
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,980
Can you believe that?

222
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,080
It's Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to deliver.

223
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,340
Where's your Christmas spirit?

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,960
What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts on their stockings?

225
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,519
Sorry, buddy.

226
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,159
You were parked in a no parking zone.

227
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,960
You were speeding and you have no ID.

228
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:42,919
Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh's been impounded and those reindeer were taken to the city zoo.

229
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,399
What?

230
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,539
This is unbelievable.

231
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,200
What's this world coming to?

232
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,139
Christmas is ruined.

233
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:52,519
What's that up ahead?

234
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,220
It looks like elves.

235
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,580
Whoa.

236
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,660
They're shooting candy canes.

237
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:58,879
Mayday.

238
00:11:59,019 --> 00:11:59,320
Mayday.

239
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:00,279
We're under heavy attack.

240
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,139
We need backup.

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,360
So Marco, the police mentioned something about the tooth fairy.

242
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,620
The tooth fairy.

243
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,360
I don't know.

244
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,799
Maybe some of our listeners don't know the story about the tooth fairy.

245
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:24,500
Can I go ahead and say it?

246
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,460
Yes, go ahead.

247
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:25,860
Okay.

248
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:28,399
Well, when you're small and you lose a tooth.

249
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,259
Your baby teeth.

250
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:29,820
Yeah.

251
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,220
You put it underneath your pillow and then you go to sleep.

252
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:43,120
And then in the night, the tooth fairy comes into the house, flies into the house, sneaks under your pillow, takes the tooth and puts money there.

253
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,539
So this is a story that parents tell their kids about what happens to their baby teeth.

254
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,220
And they get money exchanged for it.

255
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:50,500
Right.

256
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,259
So I guess it takes away the sadness of losing that tooth.

257
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:53,679
Yeah.

258
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:54,340
Yeah.

259
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,899
But in South America, for example, we have the tooth mouse.

260
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,120
The tooth mouse?

261
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,440
Yes.

262
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:00,960
Okay.

263
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:01,980
What is it?

264
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,360
How is it called in Spanish?

265
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,720
Oh, well, in some places it's called Ratoncito Perez.

266
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:09,179
Like it has a last name, Perez.

267
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:09,879
Oh, really?

268
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,480
In other places, it's just called Ratoncito, which means mouse.

269
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:14,899
Okay.

270
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,500
So it'd be like Tooth Fairy Smith.

271
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,379
Yeah, Tooth Fairy Smith.

272
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,779
And it's the same thing.

273
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,259
It's a little mouse that comes in and steals a little tooth from you and leaves money in exchange.

274
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,240
Cool.

275
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:25,860
Very cool.

276
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:30,600
So we go from Santa Claus to Guns and Wars to the Tooth Fairy.

277
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Only at EnglishPod.

278
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:32,659
Exactly.

We've got to go.

283
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:45,639
We've got some Christmas shopping to do.

284
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,600
Yes, Christmas shopping.

285
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,279
So we'll see you guys later.

286
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,000
