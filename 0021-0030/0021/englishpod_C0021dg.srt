Great, they saw us.

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They're coming this way.

Hi!

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'd like you to meet my boyfriend Greg.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He's the VP of Quality and Safety for a top Fortune 500 food company.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is my husband Arthur.

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey, how's it going?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hello.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Caroline talks about you all the time.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I guess you must be pretty busy at work.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, yeah, a VP position is not easy, you know.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I implement policies and procedures nationwide in various departments, as well as train junior managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Wow, yeah, that sounds exciting.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And what about you, Arthur?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What do you do for a living?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, I'm a top gun pilot.
