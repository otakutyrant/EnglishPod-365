Hi!

I'd like you to meet my boyfriend Greg.

Nice to meet you.

12

This is my husband Arthur.

Hey, how's it going?

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,439
Hello.

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,380
Caroline talks about you all the time.

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,460
I guess you must be pretty busy at work.

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,020
Well, yeah, a VP position is not easy, you know.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,780
I implement policies and procedures nationwide in various departments, as well as train junior managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,719
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

20
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,359
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

21
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,439
Wow, yeah, that sounds exciting.

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,980
And what about you, Arthur?

23
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,019
What do you do for a living?

24
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,859
Oh, I'm a top gun pilot.
