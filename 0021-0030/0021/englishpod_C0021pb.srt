00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English learners and welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And today we're bringing you a great intermediate lesson with some really useful vocabulary.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Some vocabulary you can use to describe your job.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is a really common situation when someone asks you what you do and you have to tell them.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Exactly.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So today's lesson is all about that.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So before we jump into our dialogue, let's start with our vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We have two simple phrases today that you'll hear in our dialogue for our vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The first one is VP.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
VP.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
VP.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So the VP of a company is?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The Vice President.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The Vice President.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Exactly.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yep.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Simple little acronym.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And the next word is Fortune 500 Company.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Fortune 500 Company.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Fortune 500 Company.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So a Fortune 500 Company is?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll let you explain.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, Fortune magazine ranks the 500 biggest companies in the US.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So a Fortune 500 Company basically is?

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
One of the 500 biggest companies in the US.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's simple.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yep.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
All right.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, with those words, it sounds like we're going to be talking to some important people today.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes, we are going to be talking to some important people, so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now, it's going to be a little bit fast, but you don't have to worry about it.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Because we'll come back and explain all of the important vocabulary.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, look.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's Caroline and her boyfriend.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She's always going on about him at the office.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, man.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jessica, Arthur, hi.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Greg.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's the VP of quality and safety for a top Fortune 500 food company.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is my husband, Arthur.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hey, how's it going?

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hello?

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Caroline talks about you all the time.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I guess you must be pretty busy at work.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, yeah.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
VP position is not easy, you know.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I implement policies and procedures nationwide in various departments, as well as trained junior managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Wow.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah, that sounds exciting.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And what about you, Arthur?

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What do you do for a living?

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, I'm a Top Gun pilot.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
All right, great music for our dialogue again, huh?

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Chosen by?

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
By moi.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Of course.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, Top Gun is one of my all-time favorite movies.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And Top Gun pilot, what a cool profession.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
An excellent profession, much cooler than being like the VP.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How boring is that?

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Anyway, this guy was a bit of a jerk, don't you think?

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, you can tell a little bit of the sarcastic tone he had in his voice.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Definitely.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But he did use some interesting phrases and we can talk about those now.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So let's take a look at language takeaway.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Language takeaway.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Our first word for language takeaways is implement.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Implement.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Implement.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Implement.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's listen to some examples of this word to help us understand its meaning.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Example one.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Our company has to implement this sales strategy.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Example two.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Sarah will be responsible for implementing the plan.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Example three.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I implemented several new policies.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, great examples.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And just in case, to implement means to?

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Put into action.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Put into action.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Great.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Our second word for language takeaway, policies.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Policies.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Policies.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Policies.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So policies are basically rules and regulations.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Exactly.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Formal rules.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
For a company or an organization.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Exactly.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Policies.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Great.

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Third word?

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oversee.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oversee.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oversee.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oversee.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So when you oversee operations, it means?

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Like you watch it to make sure it's okay.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You supervise it.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is an excellent word to use when you want to talk about your job responsibilities.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Right.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Oversee.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Great.

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And our last word for language takeaway, it's kind of tricky.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So let's listen to how it was used in our dialogue.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That alone means I have 1500 employees under me.

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That alone means I have 1500 employees under me.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So this guy has 1500 employees under him, meaning he supervises 1500 employees.

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Right.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He manages 1500 employees.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He must be a busy man.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
For 1500 employees.

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So how many employees do you have under you, Erika?

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Two.

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, not quite as much as 1500.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, I guess I'm not a VP right yet, hey?

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Not yet, but you will.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
All right.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So with this in mind, we are ready to listen to our dialogue for a second time.

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And this time it's going to be slower.

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, look, there's Caroline and her boyfriend.

135
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
She's always going on about him at the office.

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, great.

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They saw us.

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They're coming this way.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, man.

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Jessica, Arthur.

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hi.

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Greg.

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He's the VP of quality and safety for a top Fortune 500 food company.

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Nice to meet you.

145
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is my husband, Arthur.

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Hey, how's it going?

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Caroline talks about you all the time.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I guess you must be pretty busy at work.

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, yeah, a VP position is not easy, you know.

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I implement policies and procedures nationwide of various departments, as well as trained junior managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Wow, yeah, that sounds exciting.

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And what about you, Arthur?

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What do you do for a living?

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh, I'm a top gun pilot.

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay, great stuff.

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
With this, now we can start with our fluency builder for today.

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Fluency builder.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We heard some excellent phrases in this dialogue.

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Some phrases that sound really natural, hey?

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes, especially the first one that we have today is whenever someone talks and talks and talks and continuously talks without stopping, you would say...

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
She's always going on about him at the office.

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
She's always going on about him at the office.

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is a really natural way of saying keeps talking about.

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Right, keeps talking about him.

167
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So we have a few examples of how this phrase works.

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's listen.

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Example one.

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
My boss is always going on about how we need to save money.

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's all he talks about.

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Example two.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Example three.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Gary is always going on about his kids.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He's always talking about how smart they are.

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Example three.

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
My mom is always going on about how I should get married.

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay, excellent.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's clear now.

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes.

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay, so let's move on to our second phrase for today.

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And this is a great one to use whenever you meet someone for the first time.

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Or when you start to talk to someone for the first time.

184
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Hey, how's it going?

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hey, how's it going?

186
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So this is a really relaxed and natural way of saying how are you?

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How are you?

188
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah.

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So yeah, you can just say, hey, how's it going?

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yep, really natural sounding.

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now our third phrase is the most important one of our dialogue.

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes.

193
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And it's a really common situation.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
When someone asks you about your job, they might say this.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Arthur, what do you do for a living?

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Arthur, what do you do for a living?

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So this is a really great way of asking what work do you do or what is your job?

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I know a lot of students sometimes say, what is your job?

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, and that is, well, it's kind of correct, but not really.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It doesn't sound very natural, right?

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So you want to use what do you do or what do you do for a living?

203
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sounds great.

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's the way you ask someone what is their job.

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And that's how you sound supernatural.

206
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
OK, so we're ready now to listen to our dialogue last time.

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And now you are ready to understand everything.

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, look, there's Caroline and her boyfriend.

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
She's always going on about him at the office.

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Great.

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They saw us.

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
They're coming this way.

213
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, man.

214
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Jessica, Arthur, hi.

215
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Greg.

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He's the VP of quality and safety for a top Fortune 500 food company.

217
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Nice to meet you.

218
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This is my husband, Arthur.

219
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Hey, how's it going?

220
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Hello.

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Caroline talks about you all the time.

222
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I guess you must be pretty busy at work.

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Well, yeah, VP position is not easy, you know.

224
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I implement policies and procedures nationwide in various departments, as well as train junior managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

226
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Wow.

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah, that sounds exciting.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And what about you, Arthur?

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What do you do for a living?

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, I'm a top gun pilot.

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay, so I have a little challenge for our listeners today.

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What is it?

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have two challenges, actually.

235
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The first one, who performs the song that you heard and what is the song called?

236
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay, I don't know the answer.

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So I'm looking forward to seeing what users do.

238
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And the second one is what is the number one company in the Fortune 500?

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh, I also don't know this answer.

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Two great questions, so I expect to see your answers on the comments page, but also we want to know about your profession.

241
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes, tell us about your job.

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Tell us what you do and use some of the great phrases you learned today to describe your answer.

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Great.

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So we hope to see you there, but we're out of time now.

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So we'll see everyone at EnglishPod.com.

246
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Leave all your questions and, of course, all the comments.

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And Marco and I are always around to answer your questions.

248
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, until then, it's goodbye.
