00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,480
Hello English learners and welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,259
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,259
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,220
And today we're bringing you a great intermediate lesson with some really useful vocabulary.

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,460
Some vocabulary you can use to describe your job.

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,059
Yes.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,140
This is a really common situation when someone asks you what you do and you have to tell them.

8
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:23,679
Exactly.

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,699
So today's lesson is all about that.

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,780
So before we jump into our dialogue, let's start with our vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:32,960
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:38,359
We have two simple phrases today that you'll hear in our dialogue for our vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,420
The first one is VP.

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,420
VP.

15
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,140
VP.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,079
So the VP of a company is?

17
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:47,100
The Vice President.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
The Vice President.

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,020
Exactly.

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:49,600
Yep.

21
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:50,719
Simple little acronym.

22
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,859
And the next word is Fortune 500 Company.

23
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:57,259
Fortune 500 Company.

24
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,060
Fortune 500 Company.

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,039
So a Fortune 500 Company is?

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,780
I'll let you explain.

27
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,340
Well, Fortune magazine ranks the 500 biggest companies in the US.

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,340
So a Fortune 500 Company basically is?

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,859
One of the 500 biggest companies in the US.

30
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:16,379
Okay.

31
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:16,939
That's simple.

32
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:17,359
Yep.

33
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:17,900
All right.

34
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,920
Well, with those words, it sounds like we're going to be talking to some important people today.

35
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,099
Yes, we are going to be talking to some important people, so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,459
Now, it's going to be a little bit fast, but you don't have to worry about it.

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,819
Because we'll come back and explain all of the important vocabulary.

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,560
Oh, look.

39
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,560
There's Caroline and her boyfriend.

40
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,599
She's always going on about him at the office.

41
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:50,719
Oh, great.

42
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,560
They saw us.

43
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,159
They're coming this way.

44
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,719
Oh, man.

45
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,620
Jessica, Arthur, hi.

46
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,519
I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Greg.

47
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,860
He's the VP of Quality and Safety for a top Fortune 500 food company.

48
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,460
Nice to meet you.

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,759
This is my husband, Arthur.

50
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,500
Hey, how's it going?

51
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:16,000
Hello.

52
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,000
Caroline talks about you all the time.

53
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,580
I guess you must be pretty busy.

54
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,680
Well, yeah, a VP position is not easy, you know.

55
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:33,400
I implement policies and procedures nationwide in various departments, as well as train junior managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,379
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

57
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,000
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

58
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,599
Wow.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,080
Yeah, that sounds exciting.

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,599
And what about you, Arthur?

61
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,680
What do you do for a living?

62
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,500
Oh, I'm a Top Gun pilot.

63
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:10,180
All right, great music for our dialogue again, huh?

64
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,300
Chosen by?

65
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,219
By moi.

66
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:12,780
Of course.

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,400
Yeah, Top Gun is one of my all-time favorite movies.

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,780
And Top Gun pilot, what a cool profession.

69
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,259
An excellent profession, much cooler than being, like, the VP.

70
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,900
How boring is that?

71
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,099
Anyway, this guy was a bit of a jerk, don't you think?

72
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:30,819
Yeah, you can tell a little bit of the sarcastic tone he had in his voice.

73
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,419
Definitely.

74
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:35,319
But he did use some interesting phrases, and we can talk about those now.

75
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,000
Right, so let's take a look at language takeaway.

76
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,719
Language takeaway.

77
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,180
Our first word for language takeaways is implement.

78
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,099
Implement.

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,840
Implement.

80
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:47,879
Implement.

81
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:53,419
Let's listen to some examples of this word to help us understand its meaning.

82
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,340
Example one.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,659
Our company has to implement this sales strategy.

84
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,259
Example two.

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,539
Sarah will be responsible for implementing the plan.

86
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,620
Example three.

87
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,720
I implemented several new policies.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,939
Okay, great examples, and just in case, to implement means to?

89
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,920
Put into action.

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,939
To put into action.

91
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,420
Exactly.

92
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,019
Our second word for language takeaway, policies.

93
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:36,199
Policies.

94
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:37,959
Policies.

95
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:42,699
So, policies are basically rules and regulations.

96
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:43,339
Exactly.

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,339
Formal rules.

98
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,480
For a company or an organization.

99
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,040
Exactly.

100
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:47,639
Policies.

101
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,100
Great.

102
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,079
Third word?

103
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,339
Oversee.

104
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,899
Oversee.

105
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:53,540
Oversee.

106
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,699
Oversee.

107
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,779
So, when you oversee operations, it means?

108
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,019
Like, you watch it to make sure it's okay.

109
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,060
You supervise it.

110
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,839
This is an excellent word to use when you want to talk about your job responsibilities.

111
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:07,959
Oversee.

112
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:09,139
Great.

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,699
And our last word for language takeaway, it's kind of tricky.

114
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,980
So, let's listen to how it was used in our dialogue.

115
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,240
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

116
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:28,240
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

117
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:36,819
So, this guy has 1,500 employees under him, meaning he supervises 1,500 employees.

118
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,060
Right.

119
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,420
He manages 1,500 employees.

120
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,120
He must be a busy man.

121
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:40,860
Yes.

122
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:41,939
For 1,500 employees.

123
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:44,800
How many employees do you have under you, Erika?

124
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:45,819
Two.

125
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:46,579
Yeah.

126
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,860
Not quite as much as 1,500.

127
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:48,560
Yeah.

128
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,839
I guess I'm not a VP right yet, hey?

129
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,519
Not yet, but you will.

130
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

131
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:53,800
All right.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,860
So, with this in mind, we are ready to listen to our dialogue for a second time.

133
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,579
And this time, it's going to be slower.

134
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:04,139
Oh, look.

135
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,480
There's Caroline and her boyfriend.

136
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,800
She's always going on about him at the office.

137
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:11,680
Oh, great.

138
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,939
They saw us.

139
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,819
They're coming this way.

140
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,480
Oh, man.

141
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:19,139
Jessica.

142
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,279
Arthur.

143
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,399
Hi.

144
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,279
Hey.

145
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,680
I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Greg.

146
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,740
He's the VP of Quality and Safety for a top Fortune 500 food company.

147
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,100
Nice to meet you.

148
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:35,459
This is my husband, Arthur.

149
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,439
Hey.

150
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:36,959
How's it going?

151
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:37,339
Hello.

152
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,980
Caroline talks about you all the time.

153
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,420
I guess you must be pretty busy at work.

154
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:45,439
Well, yeah.

155
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:48,199
A VP position is not easy, you know.

156
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:59,459
I implement policies and procedures nationwide of various departments, as well as trained junior managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

157
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:06,100
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

158
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,339
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

159
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,899
Wow.

160
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah.

161
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,300
That sounds exciting.

162
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:17,779
And what about you, Arthur?

163
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,399
What do you do for a living?

164
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,439
Oh, I'm a top gun pilot.

165
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,939
Okay, great stuff.

166
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,139
With this, now we can start with our fluency builder for today.

167
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,319
Fluency builder.

168
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,879
We heard some excellent phrases in this dialogue, some phrases that sound really natural, hey?

169
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:41,860
Yes.

170
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:51,860
Especially the first one that we have today is whenever someone talks and talks and talks and just continuously talks without stopping, you would say...

171
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,199
She's always going on about him at the office.

172
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,459
She's always going on about him at the office.

173
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,160
This is a really natural way of saying keeps talking about.

174
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:06,660
Right.

175
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:07,699
Keeps talking about him.

176
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,800
So we have a few examples of how this phrase works.

177
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,199
Let's listen.

178
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,899
Example one.

179
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,920
My boss is always going on about how we need to save money.

180
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,959
It's all he talks about.

181
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,339
Example two.

182
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,960
Gary is always going on about his kids.

183
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,740
He's always talking about how smart they are.

184
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,580
Example three.

185
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,580
My mom is always going on about how I should get married.

186
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:52,240
Okay, excellent.

187
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,159
It's clear now.

188
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:53,639
Yes.

189
00:08:54,039 --> 00:09:00,580
Okay, so let's move on to our second phrase for today, and this is a great one to use whenever you meet someone for the first time.

190
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,000
Or when you start to talk to someone for the first time.

191
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,299
Great.

192
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:05,879
Hey, how's it going?

193
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,620
Hey, how's it going?

194
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:15,200
So this is a really relaxed and natural way of saying, how are you?

195
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:15,700
How are you?

196
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,139
Yeah.

197
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,419
So yeah, you can just say, hey, how's it going?

198
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:18,759
Yep.

199
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:19,259
Great.

200
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,240
Really natural sounding.

201
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,179
Now our third phrase is the most important one of our dialogue.

202
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:24,899
Yes.

203
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,740
And it's a really common situation.

204
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,659
When someone asks you about your job, they might say this.

205
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,000
Arthur, what do you do for a living?

206
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:38,100
Arthur, what do you do for a living?

207
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:45,240
So this is a really great way of asking what work do you do or what is your job?

208
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,159
I know a lot of students sometimes say, what is your job?

209
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:50,779
Yeah.

210
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,159
And that is, it's kind of correct, but not really.

211
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,159
It doesn't sound very natural.

212
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,539
So you want to use, what do you do?

213
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,700
Or, what do you do for a living?

214
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:01,620
Sounds great.

215
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,899
That's the way you ask someone what is their job.

216
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,519
And that's how you sound supernatural.

217
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:06,600
Okay.

218
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,620
So we're ready now to listen to our dialogue a last time.

219
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,919
And now you are ready to understand everything.

220
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:23,500
Oh, look, there's Caroline and her boyfriend.

221
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,659
She's always going on about him at the office.

222
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,179
Great.

223
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,600
They saw us.

224
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,980
They're coming this way.

225
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,659
Oh, man.

226
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,340
Jessica, Arthur, hi.

227
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,440
I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Greg.

228
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:45,759
He's the VP of quality and safety for a top fortune 500 food company.

229
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,379
Nice to meet you.

230
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,659
This is my husband, Arthur.

231
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,399
Hey, how's it going?

232
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:51,960
Hello.

233
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,919
Caroline talks about you all the time.

234
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,980
I guess you must be pretty busy at work.

235
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,480
Well, yeah, VP position is not easy, you know.

236
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:09,299
I implement policies and procedures nationwide, various departments, as well as trained junior managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

237
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,259
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

238
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,899
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

239
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,399
Wow.

240
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,960
Yeah, that sounds exciting.

241
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,500
And what about you, Arthur?

242
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,559
What do you do for a living?

243
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,419
Oh, I'm a top gun pilot.

244
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,919
You're in here for a pilot approach.

245
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay, so I have a little challenge for our listeners today.

246
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:47,860
What is it?

247
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,820
Two challenges, actually.

248
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:55,220
The first one, who performs the song that you heard and what is the song called?

249
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,100
Okay, I don't know the answer, so I'm looking forward to seeing what users do.

250
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,740
And the second one is, what is the number one company in the Fortune 500?

251
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,080
Oh, I also don't know this answer.

252
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:15,559
Two great questions, so I expect to see your answers on the comments page, but also we want to know about your profession.

253
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:24,159
Yes, tell us about your job, tell us what you do, and use some of the great phrases you learned today to describe your answer.

254
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:31,179
Great, so we hope to see you there, but we're out of time now, so we'll see everyone at EnglishPod.com.

255
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,740
Leave all your questions and, of course, all the comments.

256
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,240
And Marco and I are always around to answer your questions.

257
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,259
Well, until then, it's goodbye.
