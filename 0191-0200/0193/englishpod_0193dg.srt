00:00:01,759 --> 00:00:07,580
EnglishPod.com Mr.

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,000
and Mrs.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,339
Robinson, let's get straight to it.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,759
You have saved up your money for years and are now ready to build your dream home.

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,359
What did you have in mind?

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,339
A suburban bungalow straight out of the 60s.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,800
A perfect lawn with minimal landscaping.

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,859
A brick patio in the backyard with an old-fashioned grill, quaint lawn furniture, and a swimming pool.

9
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:33,859
A two-car carport, pastel siding, and a gable roof, completed with white shutters and a white picket fence.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,200
Uh, honey?

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,340
In the living room, we would have moss-green rugs, and a fireplace with a stone mantle and wood paneling on the walls.

12
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:47,840
In the kitchen, the cupboards would be a pale yellow, and we would have a turquoise metal oven and vinyl flooring.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:55,460
Um, sweetie, but I was thinking of more modern-style house, an open-concept house, or glass, wood, metal, and concrete.

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,780
But sweetums, there's always a lot of wasted space in those kinds of homes.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,600
Besides, it's just a fad.

16
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:05,519
It doesn't have the homey feeling the old homes do.

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,060
Sweetie pie, it's not a lot of wasted space.

18
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:16,640
It is relaxing, and the house would be eco-friendly with an in-floor heating system and designed to retain the heat of the sun in the winter and keep the house cool in the summer.

19
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:18,799
We would have solar panels on the roof.

20
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:21,060
Do you know how much those things cost?

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,120
What about your vintage furniture, dearest?

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:35,180
And instead of a lawn, which is also a lot of wasted space and would require environmentally harmful pesticides, we would have a fish pond in the backyard and a garden that would cover the whole yard so we could grow our own food.

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,920
But, buttercup, I thought you always said that you love visiting your grandmother's house.

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,840
And I thought you, Mr.

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,159
Scientist, were all up on saving the planet with your technological advancements.

26
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,400
Um, well, I am just going to get some coffee while you two keep discussing.

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,180
Thanks for watching.
