00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Mr.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and Mrs.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Robinson, let's get straight to it.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You have saved up your money for years and are now ready to build your dream home.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What did you have in mind?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A suburban bungalow straight out of the 60s.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A perfect lawn with minimal landscaping.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A brick patio in the backyard with an old-fashioned grill, quaint lawn furniture, and a swimming pool.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A two-car carport, pastel siding, and a gable roof, completed with white shutters and a white picket fence.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Uh, honey?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In the living room, we would have moss-green rugs, and a fireplace with a stone mantle and wood paneling on the walls.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In the kitchen, the cupboards would be a pale yellow, and we would have a turquoise metal oven and vinyl flooring.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Um, sweetie, but I was thinking of more modern-style house, an open-concept house, or glass, wood, metal, and concrete.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But sweetums, there's always a lot of wasted space in those kinds of homes.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Besides, it's just a fad.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It doesn't have the homey feeling the old homes do.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Sweetie pie, it's not a lot of wasted space.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It is relaxing, and the house would be eco-friendly with an in-floor heating system and designed to retain the heat of the sun in the winter and keep the house cool in the summer.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We would have solar panels on the roof.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Do you know how much those things cost?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What about your vintage furniture, dearest?

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And instead of a lawn, which is also a lot of wasted space and would require environmentally harmful pesticides, we would have a fish pond in the backyard and a garden that would cover the whole yard so we could grow our own food.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But, buttercup, I thought you always said that you love visiting your grandmother's house.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And I thought you, Mr.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Scientist, were all up on saving the planet with your technological advancements.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Um, well, I am just going to get some coffee while you two keep discussing.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thanks for watching.
