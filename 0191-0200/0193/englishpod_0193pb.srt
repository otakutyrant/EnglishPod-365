00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about a dream home, so building the home of your dreams.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's right, and this lesson today is advanced, so it might be a little bit hard, and we're gonna be taking a look at not only some vocabulary related to your home or decorations and stuff, but also how to treat your loved one in a nice way, or little, what do you call them, nicknames.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Cute names, pet names, that's right.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So stay tuned, we'll be talking about very specific things having to do with building a home and home remodeling, and so we'll hear this dialogue one time, but when we're back in just a minute here we'll be talking about what those things mean.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:19,000
A suburban bungalow straight out of the 60s, a perfect lawn with minimal landscaping, a brick patio in the backyard with an old-fashioned grill, quaint lawn furniture, and a swimming pool, a two-car carport, pastel siding, and a gable roof, completed with white shutters and a white picket fence.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In the living room we would have moss green rugs, and a fireplace with a stone mantle and wood paneling on the walls.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
In the kitchen the cupboards would be a pale yellow, and we would have a turquoise metal oven and vinyl flooring.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Um, sweetie, but I was thinking of more a modern-style house, an open-concept house all glass, wood, metal, and concrete.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But sweetums, there's always a lot of wasted space in those kinds of homes.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Besides it's just a fad, it doesn't have the homey feeling the old homes do.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Sweetie pie, it's not a lot of wasted space, it is relaxing and the house would be eco-friendly with an in-floor heating system and designed to retain the heat of the sun in the winter and keep the house cool in the summer.

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We would have solar panels on the roof.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you know how much those things cost?

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What about your vintage furniture, dearest?

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And instead of a lawn, which is also a lot of wasted space and would require environmentally harmful pesticides, we would have a fish pond in the backyard and a garden that would cover the whole yard so we could grow our own food.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But buttercup, I thought you always said that you love visiting your grandmother's house.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And I thought you, Mr.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Scientist, were all up on saving the planet with your technological advancements.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Um, well, I am just going to get some coffee while you two keep discussing.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Alright, we're back.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So apparently the couple can't seem to agree.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He wants something different than what she does and in the end I think they were a little bit irritated with each other.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Doesn't this always happen though?

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I mean, my dream home is probably not your dream home.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't know.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's weird.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But I mean, you would probably have to, I don't know, compensate somehow or...

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, that's the beauty of compromise, I think.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You can go back and forth, but with your loved one or your spouse, you have to make some decisions about what you want and what they want.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
All you need to do is give a guy his own room in which he can decorate and do whatever he wants with it.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's all you need.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No, no, not me, just any guy.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Just, you want to decorate the house in any way you want, fine, but just give us one room, you know, like five meters by five meters where we can put anything we want.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
A beer cooler, a TV, a PS3, a sound system, and a couple of guitars.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, probably.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's enough.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You described it.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I've been to your house.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I know.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Anyway, we've got a lot of great words here in Language Takeaway, so let's take a peek at some of those.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Language Takeaway All right, so the first word that we have, or it's actually a concept, minimal landscaping.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, so minimal is a style, minimal list actually, and minimal landscaping is this kind of style of, well, designing your lawn or your garden.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So minimal means not having adornments or decorations.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay, so it's kind of like the less is more type thing.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Exactly.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So minimal architecture could be very simple, lots of clean lines, not much decoration.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's the opposite of something that's baroque and highly ornamented.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, I don't like that.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm into minimal.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
All right, minimalist.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Anyways, we have minimal landscaping, and boy, he's talking about his patio and old fashioned grill, and he said quaint lawn furniture.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Quaint is sometimes, well, it's usually kind of a bad thing.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We say something is quaint in the way of saying that it's cute, but we don't really like it because it's maybe old fashioned or, you know, kind of old style.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So oh, isn't that quaint?

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's something that people from the city often say about people in the country, at least in America.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So, oh, because, you know, I went to school on the East Coast, and I'm from the Midwest.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So people on the East Coast would say, oh, your house is so quaint, small and cute and old fashioned, because they live in a big, fancy New York apartment or whatever.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So quaint is usually something that's not the nicest.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So he's looking for some lawn furniture that's not like plastic or new.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's more like old fashioned, maybe wood, right?

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Right, and kind of traditional and not, yeah, not fancy, kind of simple.

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Now he's also talking about the house, and he wants, well, a two carport, pastel siding, and a gable roof.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So now we know what a roof is, but what is a gable roof?

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A gable is a thing, right?

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And it's, it's almost like an extension of the roof in certain parts.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
For example, on a traditional Cape Cod style house, you have windows in the front that they're not a part of the roof.

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They're an extension.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They come out.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They're kind of like popping out like eyes.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Exactly.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
They're coming out like eyes.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And so the roof, obviously you need a roof on top of those windows.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So that kind of roof, that little extension, that's called a gable.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And so there's a wonderful book that's famous in American history called The House of Seven Gables.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That means that on this roof of the house, there are seven different parts that come out.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Seven gables.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's very unique.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Those houses usually look a little bit scary.

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They do, Victorian and imposing.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So you have a gable roof.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Now you have shutters and a white picket fence.

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This is typical.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Everyone talks about a white picket fence around their house.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's right.

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There was even a TV show in America years ago called Picket Fences.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I think a picket fence is kind of this ideal in American culture about having your own home in the suburbs and having your own space.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And so around your yard, around your garden, you have this white picket fence.

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And so a picket is, I think the pointed part.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So a picket fence is thin pieces of wood that stand in the ground and are connected to protect your property from other people coming inside.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So that's a white picket fence.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You'll hear it all the time.

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Usually in movies or in TV shows, they talk about having their own little house with their dog and a white picket fence.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Two kids, two cars.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And a white picket fence.

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
All right.

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So now the woman argued that she wanted something a little bit more modern.

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And well, the guy said, you know what?

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's just wasted space.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And those types of homes are just a fad.

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
A fad.

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So a fad is something that is passing.

106
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's something that's popular for a short time, but then it goes away.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's not popular anymore.

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So, for example, I think for a while, remember those shoes, they used to have little red lights in the back and the heel.

109
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh yeah.

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
L.A.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
lights.

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
L.A.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
lights.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Those were a fad.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It was really popular for like a year.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Everyone had them.

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Everyone wore them.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And then they just went away.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
One of my favorite fads of the 1980s were those shirts that would change color if the room temperature changed color.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So if you go outside and it's hot, they would become bright pink.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But if you're in a cold room, they would go blue and green.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It was really fun.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But they're definitely out of fashion.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, I don't think they wear them anymore.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So that's a fad.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Something that's temporary.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's popular for a while.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So he called her house a fad and she says, well, what about your house?

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All this vintage furniture.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What's vintage?

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, some people think that vintage is a fad.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
A lot of people really enjoy buying vintage furniture or vintage clothing.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Vintage means old.

134
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's a nice way of saying old or like a nice or cool way of saying old.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, so it's almost like, for example, right now, 1940s and 50s clothes are very popular.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
A lot of girls are into this kind of style.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So it's called vintage clothing because it's not from today's styles.

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's an old style.

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Or you could even call those big, flowing dresses from the 1970s vintage clothing.

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So vintage furniture would be furniture that comes from a different time, a different era.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And it's popular now.

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Right, they're popular now.

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Or people like to buy them now.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So they're special because they come from a different time.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay.

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So those are the words that we have for today on Language Takeaway.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why don't we move on now to some pet names or some sweet ways that you can call your loved ones on Fluency Builder.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So the reason this dialogue is very funny is because we have these two people who are clearly in disagreement about the kinds of furniture and house they want, but they're being so nice to each other.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
They have these cute names for each other.

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So it's really, I don't know, it's really funny.

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It almost seems like they're newlyweds, but apparently they've been saving up their entire life.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So maybe they're just one of those really loving couples.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, sweetums, kittypie, kitty.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
All right, so that's the first one.

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Sweetums.

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Sweetums.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So obviously the main part of this word is sweet.

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Sweetums.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Sweetums.

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And this is a way to say, hey, sweetie.

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Sweetums.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Sweetums.

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So you can say sweetie or sweetums.

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Exactly.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And that's a nice way of saying something.

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Or you can go sweetie pie.

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Sweetie pie.

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So pie is a food.

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You know, it's like a dessert.

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Pie is sweet.

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's a sweet.

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So sweetie pie.

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Or you could say honey pie.

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Honey pie, sweetie pie.

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So these are all cute.

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And you know, the nice thing about these kind of pet names, these cute names, is you can change them if you want.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And they're yours.

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So you could say honey pie, sugar bun, you know, these are, they're silly, but there's no real rule.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But these are the most common.

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Right, right.

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Sweetums and sweetie pie.

183
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay.

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Now, moving on to something a little bit maybe more formal.

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Dearest.

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Dearest.

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This makes me think of my grandparents.

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh, really?

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Dearest.

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So dearest comes from deer.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Dearest is the most dear.

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So someone who's the most important to you.

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay.

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And so you could say mummy dearest, mother dearest.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh, really?

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You heard that so much?

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, yeah.

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Do people call it, their mother's like mother dearest?

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Mother dearest.

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No, it's very 1930s.

201
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Sounds so arrogant.

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It is, well, it's an old time thing.

203
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's not, we do not say this anymore, but you can say, you know, dearest, would you mind moving the car, please?

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I like the accent you have, it's kind of like English.

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
All right.

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And the last one, buttercup.

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is really popular.

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is really popular and you've heard this in a song before.

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You want to sing the song?

210
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, you sing the song.

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why do you build me up?

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Buttercup, baby.

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So that was in a lot of movies.

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The word is buttercup.

216
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Buttercup.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Also in the movie, the princess bride was the character of princess buttercup.

218
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And so this is a sweet, you know, obviously a sweet thing.

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I think a buttercup is a flower.

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, really?

221
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And so these are all words you can use, names you could use with men and women, but buttercup is mostly women.

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think the other ones are more general.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But do you think, like, do guys say to their loved ones, like, sweetum, sweetie pie?

225
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh, yeah.

226
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah?

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, yeah.

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
All right.

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So I guess, guys, if you want to be really sweet and you want to win over the hearts of the ladies, you can use these these words as well.

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Another popular one is babe, which is more of a young person thing to say.

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, I think it's more modern as well.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Honey or babe.

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Baby.

234
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Baby.

235
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're verging on.

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Not so.

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Not so sweet.

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No, but like, hey, baby.

239
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
How are you?

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Nice.

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Not like, hey, baby.

242
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
All right.

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, we're going to leave you with that thought and go listen to this dialogue one more time, but we'll be back in a moment.

244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Mr.

245
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and Mrs.

246
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Robinson, let's get straight to it.

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You have saved up your money for years and are now ready to build your dream home.

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What did you have in mind?

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
A suburban bungalow straight out of the 60s.

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:26,000
A perfect lawn with minimal landscaping, a brick patio in the backyard with an old fashioned grill, quaint lawn furniture and a swimming pool, a two car carport, pastel siding and a gable roof completed with white shutters and a white picket fence.

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Honey?

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
In the living room, we would have moss green rugs and a fireplace with a stone mantle and wood paneling on the walls.

253
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
In the kitchen, the cupboards would be a pale yellow and we would have a turquoise metal oven and vinyl flooring.

254
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Um, sweetie, but I was thinking of more a modern style house, an open concept house or glass, wood, metal and concrete.

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But sweetums, there's always a lot of wasted space in those kinds of homes.

256
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Besides, it's just a fad.

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It doesn't have the homey feeling the old homes do.

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Sweetie pie, it's not a lot of wasted space.

259
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It is relaxing and the house would be eco-friendly with an in-floor heating system and designed to retain the heat of the sun in the winter and keep the house cool in the summer.

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We would have solar panels on the roof.

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Do you know how much those things cost?

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What about your vintage furniture, dearest?

263
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And instead of a lawn, which is also a lot of wasted space and would require environmentally harmful pesticides, we would have a fish pond in the backyard and a garden that would cover the whole yard so we could grow our own food.

264
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But Buttercup, I thought you always said that you love visiting your grandmother's house.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And I thought you, Mr.

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Scientist, were all up on saving the planet with your technological advancements.

267
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Um, well, I am just going to get some coffee while you two keep discussing.

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Alright, we're back.

269
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So apart from these decorations and stuff, do you agree with the vintage home, the more like minimalist thing, or do you like the open concept one, the bigger one?

270
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I, I love the look of minimalism.

271
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But as a place to live, it's not comfortable.

272
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Right.

273
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And so when I think of an aesthetic that I like, you know, a look that I like, I really like kind of dark wood, velvety, century kind of Wow.

274
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Like I think of old Vienna, you know, like Castle Dracula, no, not dark.

275
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I like things to be open.

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And I like a lot of natural light, but I also like oversized kind of heavy furniture and really luscious fabrics and things like that.

277
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So that's my I'm actually completely different because I do like this open concept.

278
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I like those houses that I like the way they look inside as well as outside when they're kind of squared, big windows, clean lines.

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Inside is like for example, in the kitchen, you have polished aluminum or polished steel furniture in the kitchen, as well as a lot of white and red or black, especially.

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I kind of like that kind of open spaces.

281
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Primary colors.

282
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Flat screen TVs on the wall and stuff like that, like remote control IKEA lamps.

283
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah.

284
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You know, like those remote controls where you can open your curtains, your TV and the lights all the same time.

285
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I kind of like that stuff.

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Cool.

287
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Well, let us know what you guys like, because everyone has their own opinion on beautiful houses.

288
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And if you have any pictures, feel free to share them with us on our website, EnglishPod.com.

289
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,000
All right.

290
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We'll see you guys there.

291
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Bye.

292
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Bye.
