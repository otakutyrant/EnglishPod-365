EnglishPod.com Alright class, now that we're all dressed up, let's see what professions you chose.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ah, I see a fireman, a police officer, a medic, and a lifeguard.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Can anyone tell me what these people have in common?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They save people from bad things?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's right!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now class, if something bad happened and you had to get help, do you know what phone number you would call?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
9-1-1 Yes!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You would pick up the phone and dial 9-1-1.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What are some emergency situations in which you would need to dial 9-1-1?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If my grandpa had a heart attack.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If there was an accident.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If a robber broke into the house.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If the fire alarm went off.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I wouldn't call 9-1-1 if the fire alarm went off in my house.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The only time that ever happens is when we're having spaghetti for supper and my mom burns the garlic bread as usual.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Thanks for watching!
