00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,080
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:05,780
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:10,919
My name is Katherine, and today we've got a great, informative lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,759
That's right.

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,859
We are going to talk about an emergency situation.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,879
So what do you do when you have an emergency?

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,719
You dial 911.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:19,859
Exactly.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,379
All right, well, maybe not in your country, but today we're talking about emergencies in America and jobs, so people who can help you in an emergency.

10
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,320
So before we get into those words and phrases, let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,399
All right, class, now that we're all dressed up, let's see what professions you chose.

12
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,359
I see a fireman, a police officer, a medic, and a lifeguard.

13
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,740
Can anyone tell me what these people have in common?

14
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,299
They save people from bad things?

15
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,340
That's right.

16
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:57,420
Now, class, if something bad happened and you had to get help, do you know what phone number you would call?

17
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:58,560
911.

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,039
Yes!

19
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,560
You would pick up the phone and dial 911.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,579
What are some emergency situations in which you would need to dial 911?

21
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,760
If my grandpa had a heart attack.

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,579
If there was an accident.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,939
If a robber broke into the house.

24
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:15,120
If the fire alarm went off.

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,459
I wouldn't call 911 if the fire alarm went off in my house.

26
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:24,299
The only time that ever happens is when we're having spaghetti for supper and my mom burns the garlic bread as usual.

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,219
All right, we're back.

28
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:37,180
So now we have a couple of different jobs for people that are working specifically in emergency situations.

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,200
So let's take a look at those now in Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:43,959
Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,500
All right, so we have a teacher in today's dialogue who's talking to her students about jobs.

32
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,920
So probably these students are very young and she says another word that means jobs.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,120
What's the word she uses?

34
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Professions.

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,239
Professions.

36
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,200
That's the plural.

37
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,060
So profession is a job.

38
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:04,040
Let's say, for example, a lawyer is a profession.

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,640
Or a doctor.

40
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:07,359
A doctor, a lawyer.

41
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,939
So what's your profession is another way to ask what's your job.

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,620
All right, so they're talking about professions and some of the kids dressed up as different people.

43
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,680
The first one was a fireman.

44
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,000
A fireman.

45
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,740
So you know the first word fire.

46
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,419
A fireman is a person who puts out a fire.

47
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,939
That means he uses water to stop a fire.

48
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:30,780
Very good.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,219
So a fireman puts out fires.

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,580
Now apart from a fireman, we also have a police officer.

51
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,620
A police officer.

52
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,080
So an officer is someone who works in an official capacity, so in a job.

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,439
So we could say he is a police officer or a policeman or a policewoman.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,800
So three ways to say this.

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,139
So officer is for both genders, right?

56
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,419
A man or a woman could be a police officer.

57
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:56,939
That's right.

58
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,740
So you're going to hear this very often because policeman doesn't explain a woman police officer.

59
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,060
So we use police officer to be general.

60
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:05,699
Okay.

61
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,620
So we have a fireman, a police officer, a medic.

62
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:10,939
Now what is this medic?

63
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,979
A medic is a kind of doctor.

64
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:16,900
Someone who will look at your health or help you if you've hurt yourself.

65
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:24,500
Who usually works on the road like driving to an accident or driving to a fire with police officers.

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,419
So these people help police officers and firemen when there's an emergency.

67
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,419
So a medic is not really a doctor.

68
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,080
He's more of a specific person that can help you if you have maybe some cuts or bruises or will help you out.

69
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:37,479
Right.

70
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:44,060
So this person will stop your bleeding or will help take you to the hospital and they'll make sure that you're healthy when you get to the hospital.

71
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,819
But they are not really like a doctor where you work in a hospital or a doctor's office.

72
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,340
Okay.

73
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,360
And our last profession is a lifeguard.

74
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,099
Well think about these two words.

75
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,960
We have life and we have guard.

76
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,080
Guard is like protect.

77
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,819
So a person that protects your life.

78
00:03:59,659 --> 00:03:59,979
Interesting.

79
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,479
Well this is someone who usually works at the beach or at a pool.

80
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,400
They have a special chair and usually they have a cross on their bathing suit or on their towel.

81
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,860
And this means that they're going to help protect people who are at the beach.

82
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,379
So if someone can't swim, the lifeguard will run or swim to get them and save them.

83
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:19,959
Okay.

84
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,560
Very good.

85
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,060
So you have a lifeguard.

86
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,500
Now this is for men and women as well, right?

87
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,060
A lifeguard.

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,540
Okay.

89
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,139
So interesting professions.

90
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,339
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back shortly.

91
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,060
All right class.

92
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,839
Now that we're all dressed up, let's see what professions you chose.

93
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,779
I see a fireman, a police officer, a medic and a lifeguard.

94
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,139
Can anyone tell me what these people have in common?

95
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
They save people from bad things?

96
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,740
That's right.

97
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,819
Now class, if something bad happened and you had to get help, do you know what phone number you would call?

98
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,000
911.

99
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,420
Yes.

100
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,959
You would pick up the phone and dial 911.

101
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:03,980
What are some emergency situations in which you would need to dial 911?

102
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,220
If my grandpa had a heart attack.

103
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
If there was an accident.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,379
If a robber broke into the house.

105
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:12,540
If the fire alarm went off.

106
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,839
I wouldn't call 911 if the fire alarm went off in my house.

107
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,720
The only time that ever happens is when we're having spaghetti for supper and my mom burns the garlic bread as usual.

108
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:25,639
All right.

109
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,000
We're back.

110
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,759
So now let's start with Fluency Builder.

111
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,079
Fluency Builder.

112
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,279
Our first item in Fluency Builder we've already talked about.

113
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,220
The number in America to call when you have an emergency is 911.

114
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,459
So we usually say, hey, dial 911.

115
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,040
Okay.

116
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,939
So that's a verb there, to dial.

117
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:46,660
Exactly.

118
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,579
To dial means to select the numbers for a phone call.

119
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:51,899
To telephone someone.

120
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:52,939
To telephone someone.

121
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,500
To dial.

122
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,800
So you can dial 911 or dial my office number.

123
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,379
Or I tried to dial your home number, but no one answered.

124
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,060
Okay.

125
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,660
Now, you can call 911 for many different situations or emergency.

126
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:11,500
One of the kids said, well, if my grandpa had a heart attack.

127
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,399
Okay.

128
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,360
So this is an example of an emergency.

129
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,379
A heart attack is a medical problem.

130
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,639
It's when your heart cannot receive oxygen.

131
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,620
So your heart stops beating sometimes.

132
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:24,379
That's right.

133
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:25,899
Sorry.

134
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,100
It's when your heart does not receive enough blood or oxygen.

135
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,759
So it's when your heart stops beating.

136
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:31,500
Okay.

137
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:31,680
Okay.

138
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:32,079
Very good.

139
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,920
So that's a heart attack.

140
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:40,240
Now, another possible emergency situation is if the fire alarm goes off.

141
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,420
This often happens in office buildings and schools.

142
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,560
So you hear a dee, dee, dee.

143
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:47,779
Right.

144
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,339
Or some kind of strange noise.

145
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,819
Well, that's because there's maybe a fire or some smoke in your building.

146
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,480
Mm-hmm.

147
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay.

148
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,220
Now, there's an interesting phrasal verb that is used along with this word fire alarm.

149
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,980
We say the fire alarm goes off or the fire alarm went off.

150
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,680
So that means it started to sound, to emit a sound.

151
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:20,500
So the verb here, as you said, it's a phrasal verb, is to go off, to go off.

152
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,120
We could say my alarm went off.

153
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,540
Mm-hmm.

154
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,139
Or every morning at 7 o'clock, my alarm goes off.

155
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,600
Okay.

156
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,240
That means your alarm begins to make a sound.

157
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,620
A very annoying sound.

158
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,680
You know, it's the worst sound ever.

159
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:37,160
But a lot of things can go off.

160
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,120
We could talk about a bell or an alarm.

161
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,079
Or fireworks.

162
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,500
Fireworks go off.

163
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,379
Okay.

164
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:50,240
And, well, the last emergency that we were talking about is if a robber broke into the house.

165
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,860
So if a robber breaks in.

166
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,519
To break into.

167
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,620
This means to enter, to go inside without permission or without a key.

168
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,379
Illegally.

169
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,000
Illegally.

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,459
So you don't have to break something, but usually you break a window or a door.

171
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:05,079
Or a door, uh-huh.

172
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,220
But this means that someone comes into your house looking to steal something.

173
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,160
So usually you have to use force.

174
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:20,360
For example, if I forget my keys inside my car and I have to break into my own car, that means maybe I have to force the door open or maybe break the window.

175
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,420
Yeah, it's not fun.

176
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,060
I think it usually ends up being very expensive.

177
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,040
Yes, it does.

178
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:26,779
All right.

179
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,779
So those are all the phrases we have for today.

180
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,480
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the very last time?

181
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,000
All right, class.

182
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,799
Now that we're all dressed up, let's see what professions you chose.

183
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,759
Ah, I see a fireman, a police officer, a medic, and a lifeguard.

184
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,120
Can anyone tell me what these people have in common?

185
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,639
They save people from bad things?

186
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,740
That's right!

187
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,799
Now, class, if something bad happened and you had to get help, do you know what phone number you would call?

188
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:57,960
911.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,440
Yes!

190
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,960
You would pick up the phone and dial 911.

191
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,980
What are some emergency situations in which you would need to dial 911?

192
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,139
If my grandpa had a heart attack.

193
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,980
If there was an accident.

194
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,340
If a robber broke into the house.

195
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,519
If the fire alarm went off.

196
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,840
I wouldn't call 911 if the fire alarm went off in my house.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,700
The only time that ever happens is when we're having spaghetti for supper and my mom burns the garlic bread as usual.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,220
So, Marco, when you were a kid and your teacher said what jobs are there, what professions are there, what profession would you like, what did you answer?

199
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,340
I always wanted to be a pilot.

200
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,740
Oh, pilot.

201
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,940
So you wanted to fly airplanes.

202
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:47,460
Yeah, I wanted to be a jet pilot.

203
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,759
Actually, I collected books about it.

204
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,720
I read up about it.

205
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:59,879
So even until now, I probably still remember the capacity of certain jets or what types of weapons they have.

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,039
I was really, really into it.

207
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Wow!

208
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,080
I never knew this about you.

209
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:03,460
Yeah.

210
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,220
What about you?

211
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,039
I could never decide as a kid.

212
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,039
I remember we had to draw pictures of what I will look like in 20 years.

213
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,659
And everyone had these pictures.

214
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,899
I will be a doctor.

215
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:14,779
I will be a veterinarian.

216
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,860
I will be the president.

217
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,320
I never knew what to draw.

218
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,399
So, you know, I think I copied my friend.

219
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,299
She wanted to be a lawyer.

220
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:21,500
Okay, that sounds okay.

221
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,440
Yeah, I think it's hard.

222
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:28,600
And usually what you want to be as a kid, you don't do it when you're older.

223
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,840
I couldn't do it because of my vision.

224
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,879
I didn't have 20-20 vision to actually join the Air Force.

225
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:36,820
Well, and a lot of kids don't know how many jobs there are out there.

226
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,059
You know the big ones.

227
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,879
Doctor, lawyer, fireman, policeman, astronaut.

228
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:45,659
So I guess the question for you is, what's your profession?

229
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,559
Tell us about it, especially if it's one of the less famous professions out there.

230
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,240
Because there's a lot that I don't know about those.

231
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,700
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

232
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,720
We hope to see you there.

233
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,220
And until next time, bye.
