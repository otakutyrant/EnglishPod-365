EnglishPod.com Welcome to Bill's Fabric World.

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:08,140
What can I do for you today?

3
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,580
I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,359
Sure we do.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,980
We have the best tailors in the country.

6
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:15,679
What is it that you need exactly?

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,899
Well, I'm looking to get a custom-made suit.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,679
Excellent.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,480
We have the finest cash mirrors at affordable prices.

10
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:23,899
How about we get you measured?

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,399
Let's start off by measuring the width of your shoulders.

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,619
Now let's measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,060
Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar?

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,119
My neck gets easily irritated.

15
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,299
No problem.

16
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:41,619
Now for your pants.

17
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:43,939
Let me just measure your waist and the inseam.

18
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:48,539
You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area.

19
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,100
I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays.

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,060
Okay.

21
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,619
Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,799
Please follow me.
