EnglishPod.com Welcome to Bill's Fabric World.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What can I do for you today?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sure we do.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We have the best tailors in the country.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What is it that you need exactly?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, I'm looking to get a custom-made suit.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Excellent.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We have the finest cash mirrors at affordable prices.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
How about we get you measured?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's start off by measuring the width of your shoulders.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now let's measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
My neck gets easily irritated.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No problem.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now for your pants.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let me just measure your waist and the inseam.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Please follow me.
