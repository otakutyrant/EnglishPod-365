00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:05,120
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,839
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,800
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about buying clothes.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,560
That's right.

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:17,579
We're going to go and get some clothes, but on this occasion, we are going to get a suit, and we're going to have it made especially for us.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,519
So before we get started, why don't we take a look at one keyword that we have in vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:24,960
Vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,179
Okay, this word makes me think of things that are very rich and soft.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,140
It's a fabric, right?

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:32,679
That's right.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,799
It's a kind of textile.

12
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:35,039
It's called cashmere.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,799
Cashmere.

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,240
So maybe you've heard of cashmere wool.

15
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,280
It's a special kind of wool that comes from animals.

16
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:49,039
So this is a textile or a fabric that is commonly used to make pants, nice pants or suits for men.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,840
Or scars or sweaters.

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,179
If you've ever had a cashmere sweater, you know it's very luxurious, very soft.

19
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,840
So it can be a little bit expensive depending on the quality, and that's what we're going to be looking at now.

20
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:04,019
We're going to be making a suit out of cashmere.

21
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,719
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time.

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,819
Welcome to Bill's Fabric World.

23
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,920
What can I do for you today?

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,379
I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes.

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,159
Sure we do.

26
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,780
We have the best tailors in the country.

27
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,480
What is it that you need exactly?

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,700
Well, I'm looking to get a custom made suit.

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,480
Excellent.

30
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,260
We have the finest cashmears at affordable prices.

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,700
How about we get you measured?

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,180
Let's start off by measuring the width of your shoulders.

33
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,359
Now let's measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here.

34
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:43,879
Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar?

35
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:45,920
My neck gets easily irritated.

36
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,099
No problem.

37
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,760
Now for your pants, let me just measure your waist and the inseam.

38
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,340
You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area.

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,900
I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays.

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,840
Okay.

41
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,400
Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design.

42
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:02,620
Please follow me.

43
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,759
So this reminds me of something that people used to do a lot more often.

44
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,840
So you'd go to the tailor and you'd have some clothes made.

45
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,840
Most people don't do this anymore.

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,240
Yeah.

47
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,259
Well, it's actually really interesting maybe because it's more expensive nowadays or tailors are harder to find.

48
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:22,900
That's right.

49
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,300
So let's learn about the words first and what they mean and then maybe we can talk about this at the end of today's show.

50
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,099
Language takeaway.

51
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,240
All right.

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,259
So today on language takeaway, we have a word that is a noun and a verb.

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,819
So as you mentioned, the person that makes suits is a tailor.

54
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,300
That's right.

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,800
You can say, my uncle is a tailor.

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,259
He makes clothes for famous people.

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,520
But this word is also a verb.

58
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,020
That means it's an action word.

59
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:55,819
We can say, my uncle, the tailor, he tailors clothes.

60
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,479
Okay.

61
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,259
So to tailor clothes and what does it mean when you say to tailor?

62
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:01,939
Well, it can have two meanings.

63
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,659
The first is what we learn about in today's dialogue.

64
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,080
It means to make clothes.

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,039
So to make a shirt or to make a pair of pants.

66
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,780
But these days we often say to tailor, which means to fix something.

67
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,939
So for example, Marco, if you buy a pair of pants and they're too long, you can have them tailored.

68
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:20,860
Have them tailored.

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,680
And that means that I am going to have them fixed so they fit me properly.

70
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:25,439
Exactly.

71
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,400
This is a lot more common right now.

72
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,680
So we're going to be tailoring clothes.

73
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,360
Now, if any of you have ever been to the tailor, what they do is they measure you.

74
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,560
And what do they measure?

75
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,020
Well, in this case, they get the width of your shoulders.

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,439
What's really great about these upcoming words is that they're useful in math as well.

77
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,400
Math and basic measurements.

78
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:50,800
So width is how big something is across.

79
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,099
How wide something is.

80
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,560
Exactly.

81
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,599
Wide width.

82
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,280
Okay.

83
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,319
So that's the width.

84
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:03,560
Now your shoulders, they are wide and well, your legs on the other hand, your legs and arms, you don't measure the width.

85
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,219
Usually you measure the length.

86
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,860
How long they are.

87
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,099
So width and length.

88
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,400
Now, just to throw it in there, this wasn't in the dialogue, but what would be the other measure word?

89
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,780
So the third word would be height.

90
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,600
So you think of a rectangle.

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,800
You have the width, how wide something is, the length, how long it is, and the height, how tall it is.

92
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,439
How tall it is.

93
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:24,680
Right.

94
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,439
So width, length, and height.

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:26,819
All right.

96
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,540
Now that we've measured our arms and legs, now we want to measure our waist.

97
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,680
Okay.

98
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,839
This is the important one.

99
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,519
This is also the sensitive one.

100
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,220
If you find that you've gained some weight, we measure the waist.

101
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,980
That's how big you are around your stomach.

102
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,220
And so usually we measure this in a circle.

103
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,860
So you've heard of a 26 inch waist or a 32 inch waist.

104
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,399
This is the size of your stomach.

105
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,500
So it's just above your hips, right?

106
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,720
As you say, it's your stomach.

107
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,000
And well, we've measured the waist and now in men especially, they measure the inseam.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,100
Now this is very particular for tailors and having suits made.

109
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:07,019
What is the inseam of your pants?

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,199
Well, think of the word in, inside.

111
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,620
This is the inside of your pants.

112
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,279
So from your foot to the middle of your pants where your zipper starts.

113
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,519
So that's not the outside length.

114
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,500
It's the inside length.

115
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,560
Now, for example, skirts, they don't have inseams, right?

116
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,620
No, because there's no inside.

117
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,019
There's no middle, right?

118
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,480
So it's just like a circle.

119
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,040
Okay.

120
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,720
But in pants or shorts, you have an inseam.

121
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,480
That's where it's connected in the middle.

122
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,040
All right.

123
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,740
So also in shorts, very interesting.

124
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,620
So you can measure the inseam of pants or shorts.

125
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:42,680
All right.

126
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,800
So very interesting and particular words for tailors.

127
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,899
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back shortly.

128
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:54,699
Welcome to Bill's Fabric World.

129
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:55,800
What can I do for you today?

130
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,259
I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes.

131
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,040
Sure we do.

132
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,660
We have the best tailors in the country.

133
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,360
What is it that you need exactly?

134
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,579
Well, I'm looking to get a custom-made suit.

135
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:07,360
Excellent.

136
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,139
We have the finest cash mirrors at affordable prices.

137
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,579
How about we get you measured?

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,019
Let's start off by measuring the width of your shoulders.

139
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,740
Now, let's measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here.

140
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,379
Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar?

141
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,439
My neck gets easily irritated.

142
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,620
No problem.

143
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,920
Now for your pants.

144
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,220
Let me just measure your waist and the inseam.

145
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,620
You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area.

146
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,220
I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays.

147
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,100
Okay.

148
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,699
Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design.

149
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,899
Please follow me.

150
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,180
All right.

151
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:43,620
We're back.

152
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,060
So now we have three key phrases that we found in this dialogue.

153
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,500
So let's take a look at them now in Fluency Builder.

154
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:52,160
Fluency Builder.

155
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,399
This first phrase is the topic of today's lesson.

156
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,019
Well, we talked a little bit about measurements for a suit.

157
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,420
But in particular, we're getting a custom-made suit.

158
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,019
Okay.

159
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,000
So this word, custom-made.

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,800
Well, custom is important.

161
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,699
It means special or unique.

162
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,180
There's no other like it.

163
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,980
So we could talk about custom cars.

164
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:15,879
That means a car that has been fixed, especially for you.

165
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,379
Okay.

166
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:24,860
So a custom-made suit would be a suit that was made specifically for your height, for how big your waist is, etc., specifically for you.

167
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,500
Right.

168
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,300
So a suit that I buy at the department store is just a normal suit.

169
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,199
But a suit that I have made for me is a custom-made suit.

170
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,560
And as you said, you can use it for cars, a custom-made car, or maybe, for example, a custom-made...

171
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,220
Custom-made kitchen.

172
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,360
That means that you get to pick every single part of the kitchen that you want.

173
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,519
Many people do that, right?

174
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,060
They have custom-built or custom-made homes.

175
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:51,779
Yeah.

176
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,959
That's always something I've wanted to do, but I hear that it's much more expensive than getting a normal home made.

177
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:57,459
All right.

178
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,939
So that's the first key phrase.

179
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,000
Now, moving on.

180
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:03,399
When we talk about measuring, we say, I measured.

181
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,240
I measured the length of this street.

182
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,060
Right.

183
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,699
Or let's measure you so we can see how big you are.

184
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,980
But if you notice in the dialogue, we use the passive voice.

185
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,920
He says, let's get you measured.

186
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:14,560
Okay.

187
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,339
I got measured or it got measured.

188
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,540
To get measured, as you say, is the passive voice.

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,439
Now, what's the difference between passive and active?

190
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:24,939
All right.

191
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:31,839
So basically, what happens here is we are concentrating on the person and the action falling upon you, for example.

192
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,580
So I got measured.

193
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,320
What happened to me?

194
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,019
I got measured.

195
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:35,700
Who did it?

196
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,399
Who measured you?

197
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:36,899
We don't know.

198
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,159
We don't know.

199
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,039
We don't care, right?

200
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:38,320
All right.

201
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:42,299
The point, the important part is that you were measured.

202
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,600
You got measured.

203
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,179
But we could have a different phrase.

204
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:53,340
We say, for example, I will measure this table or he measures the height of the door.

205
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,080
We know he measures.

206
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,460
Right.

207
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,419
I will measure.

208
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,960
We know who the actor is.

209
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:04,179
That means it's active voice because the focus is on who's doing this action.

210
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:08,360
But in passive voice, the important thing is who is receiving the action.

211
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:15,940
Now, it's a little bit complicated because as you can see, measured is in the past, but we're not really talking about the past.

212
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,940
So it may get a little bit complicated.

213
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,820
We can take a more in-depth look at that in the community section.

214
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,899
You can ask a couple questions.

215
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:28,259
We'll place a couple of examples, but it's kind of hard to get into the grammar over an audio podcast, right?

216
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,700
That's true.

217
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,559
So that's why we have the practice space on the website.

218
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:32,080
All right.

219
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,039
Now, moving on, we have our last phrase.

220
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:43,820
When he was talking about the waist and how he should leave a little bit of extra room, it's because he tends to gain a few pounds.

221
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:44,639
Okay.

222
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,820
So to gain a few pounds is like gaining a kilo.

223
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,100
It means to gain weight over the holidays.

224
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:57,000
And in this case, to tend to, I tend to means I normally or I usually.

225
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,720
So for example, Marco, what do you tend to eat for breakfast?

226
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,039
I tend to eat scrambled eggs and a glass of yogurt.

227
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:06,759
That's healthy.

228
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:09,000
Do you tend to run late in the morning?

229
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,899
Yes.

230
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,600
True.

231
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:12,940
Right.

232
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,860
So tend to, it's a tendency is what usually happens.

233
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:17,799
It's normal.

234
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:18,539
It's normal.

235
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:19,679
All right.

236
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,259
So very interesting phrases, very interesting words.

237
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,139
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time?

238
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,659
Welcome to Bill's Fabric World.

239
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,759
What can I do for you today?

240
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:37,200
I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes.

241
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,000
Sure we do.

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,620
We have the best tailors in the country.

243
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,320
What is it that you need exactly?

244
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,559
Well, I'm looking to get a custom made suit.

245
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:45,320
Excellent.

246
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,100
We have the finest cash mirrors at affordable prices.

247
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:49,539
How about we get you measured?

248
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,019
Let's start off by measuring the width of your shoulders.

249
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,200
Now let's measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here.

250
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:02,720
Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar?

251
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,779
My neck gets easily irritated.

252
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:05,960
No problem.

253
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,620
Now for your pants, let me just measure your waist and the inseam.

254
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,200
You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area.

255
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,759
I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays.

256
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:17,679
Okay.

257
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,259
Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design.

258
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,580
Please follow me.

259
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,820
All right.

260
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,559
So we talked earlier about how most people buy their clothes at a department store or a clothing store.

261
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,080
Have you seen much of this?

262
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,139
Maybe back in Ecuador it's more common than in America.

263
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, usually people just go to a department store and get suits, for example.

264
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:52,679
But it's actually very common as well because it's kind of in their artisans to be like a shoemaker or to be a tailor.

265
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,500
So actually people like it more and go to tailors because they kind of become renowned.

266
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,519
Like, oh, he used to make suits for the president.

267
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,500
So people really, really like to get suits made there.

268
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,860
And obviously they fit much better.

269
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,779
You feel more comfortable.

270
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,820
And you look better.

271
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,240
Yeah.

272
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,340
As I've said before, you know, I see people who buy all these suits.

273
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,159
My brother, for example, they never quite fit right.

274
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,440
You can tell it's a little too big in the shoulders.

275
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,379
My brother's tall so his pants are always a little bit too short.

276
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:28,139
But when you come to a place like China and most people can get these suits made for them, they just look fabulous.

277
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,460
It looks very, very nice.

278
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,100
Yeah, so maybe you guys can tell us if you've ever had anything tailor-made.

279
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,679
Not only guys' suits, but girls also get tailor-made dresses, tailor-made blouses.

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,080
I always get coats made, actually, because my shoulders are broad.

281
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,960
And so it's hard for me to find coats that fit right.

282
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,279
But if I get one custom made, it looks really good.

283
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:48,659
Right.

284
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,059
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

Bye-bye.

289
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,179
Yeah.
