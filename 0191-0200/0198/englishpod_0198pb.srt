00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:05,980
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,119
My name is Katherine, and today we are covering a very important health issue.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,119
That's right.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,919
We are...

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:14,279
that's right.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,500
In case of an emergency, maybe somebody stops breathing, so we need to apply CPR.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,000
Now what is this procedure?

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,719
Well, let's take a look at it in vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,079
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,460
CPR in English is an acronym that means C, P, and R all stand for different words.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,340
The big phrase here is cardiopulmonary resuscitation, so you don't have to remember that.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,640
Well, it's pretty hard.

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,920
What if you break it down?

15
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,840
So what is cardio?

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,020
Cardio means it has to do with your heart.

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:48,979
And then pulmonary?

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,520
Pulmonary means lungs.

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,520
It has to do with your lungs.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,479
And what about resuscitation?

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,100
That means to bring back.

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,079
So to resuscitate is to bring back to life.

23
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:58,740
That's right.

24
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,479
Okay.

25
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,820
So this is a very popular procedure.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,739
You probably see it in movies when, you know, somebody almost drowned, the lifeguard performs CPR.

27
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:08,719
Oh, no!

28
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,379
The love of my life has just drowned!

29
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:16,659
And then someone comes and they push their chest, and they say, one, two, three, and they count.

30
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,739
And then the person spits out water and everything, and they're like, heh heh heh.

31
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:22,060
I've always loved you.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,280
All right.

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,099
So that's CPR.

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,959
Why don't we listen to this dialogue, see what's going on, and we'll be back shortly.

35
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,920
Hello, everyone, and welcome to our CPR for Beginners course.

36
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,140
First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,040
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

38
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:43,760
That's right.

39
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,000
We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.

40
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,980
What does that mean?

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,859
Well, basically, if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air, then we need to get them going again.

42
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:56,859
That's when we have to apply this procedure.

43
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:57,859
Let's begin.

44
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,159
I need a volunteer.

45
00:01:59,719 --> 00:01:59,939
Me!

46
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:00,799
Me!

47
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:01,719
All right.

48
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,120
Come here and lay flat on your back.

49
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,159
Let's suppose this young woman has stopped breathing.

50
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:11,199
We must lift the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs.

51
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:17,000
Then we place our mouth over the other person's mouth and blow air two or three times, like this.

52
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,280
Wait!

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,159
What are you doing?

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,280
I'm a married woman.

55
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,479
You can't just try to kiss me like that.

56
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:23,500
Ma'am, I'm not trying to kiss you.

57
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:26,719
I'm trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.

58
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:28,319
Well, okay.

59
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,879
No French kissing.

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,560
As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner.

61
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,300
Once this is done, we must try to get the heart going again.

62
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:42,599
To do this, we place our hands over the person's chest and press down firmly two or three times.

63
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,120
Wait!

64
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:43,900
What are you doing?

65
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,300
You can't just kiss me, then go for second base.

66
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,060
All right, we're back to a couple of pretty difficult words and phrases there.

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,699
But don't worry.

68
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,879
We'll explain them now in Language Takeaway.

69
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,639
The first phrase we've got today is cardiac arrest.

70
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,539
All right.

71
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:04,479
So cardiac arrest.

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,259
Now, cardiac, I think that has to do with the heart again, right?

73
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,900
Exactly.

74
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:08,520
Your heart.

75
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,939
And what about arrest?

76
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,099
Well, arrest means two things.

77
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:15,620
Maybe you've heard of this meaning to arrest somebody.

78
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,340
The police arrested someone.

79
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, this means to stop, okay?

80
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,960
So we're not talking about the police here.

81
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,919
We're talking about the heart stopping.

82
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,020
So cardiac arrest means when your heart stops.

83
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:27,879
Okay.

84
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,060
And another word that's right next to it, pulmonary arrest.

85
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,740
So I'm guessing, again, pulmonary has to do with lungs and arrest stops.

86
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,039
So your lungs stop pumping air.

87
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:38,800
Exactly.

88
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:47,479
So cardiac and pulmonary arrest, these are two times when your heart or your lungs, they stop doing what they are supposed to do.

89
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,180
All right.

90
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,500
And interestingly enough, the heart pumps blood, the lungs pump air.

91
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,520
And that's our next word.

92
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,840
What is this word to pump?

93
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,319
To pump means to fill something with, okay?

94
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,379
So for example, the heart pumps blood to the rest of your body.

95
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:09,020
That means it's always making sure your body has blood going into it.

96
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,280
And the same thing with your lungs.

97
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,500
Your lungs help oxygen and air get to the rest of your body.

98
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,259
So they pump it.

99
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,400
They fill up with air.

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,980
And we can do the same in other things.

101
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,620
For example, you pump air into your tire.

102
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:21,279
That's right.

103
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,879
If you have a flat tire, you're riding your bicycle and your bicycle won't move, oh, no, you have to pump it with air.

104
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,300
That means fill it up with air.

105
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:28,740
Okay.

106
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,259
Or maybe even pump water, right, like in your house.

107
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,860
Or pump your car up with gas.

108
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,899
All right, very good.

109
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:43,639
So now the man is going to explain how to perform this procedure, CPR, and he asks for a volunteer.

110
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:45,639
Okay, a volunteer.

111
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,300
This is a word that can be both a noun, so a thing, and it can be an action, a verb.

112
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,339
Okay, so who is or what is a volunteer?

113
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,759
A volunteer is someone who offers to do something for free.

114
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,120
For free, without you asking them to do it.

115
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:01,199
Right.

116
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,680
So are there any volunteers in the room who wants to write this on the board?

117
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,360
Right, and somebody says, me, me, me.

118
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,480
Me, me, I do.

119
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

120
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,600
You can also volunteer to help people who need help.

121
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:18,879
So for example, in Haiti, there's an earthquake, and there are many people who offered to volunteer to help patients.

122
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,620
So that means they said, I will work for free to help these people, a volunteer.

123
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,860
A volunteer, or to volunteer.

124
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,120
Very good.

125
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,160
So now we have our volunteer, and the man is explaining what to do.

126
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,160
Lift the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs.

127
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:37,459
Oh, this is a good one.

128
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,639
So a path is like a road.

129
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,600
It's where something can go, can move.

130
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,180
To clear a pathway means to make some room.

131
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,740
To make a clear path.

132
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,439
So that means, think about it, if you can't breathe, someone has to find a way to make room to make a hole for you to breathe.

133
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:59,420
So that means to move whatever is blocking you to clear some kind of space.

134
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,160
Okay.

135
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,939
So that's a pathway, a clear space.

136
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:08,139
And now, well, he's demonstrating how to perform CPR.

137
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,720
So what is this verb, to demonstrate?

138
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,819
To demonstrate is very important.

139
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,879
We use this in most kinds of teaching.

140
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,839
So to demonstrate is to show or to give an example.

141
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:20,839
Okay.

142
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:20,920
Okay.

143
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,480
So for example, here in EnglishPod, we are demonstrating how to use these words in sentences.

144
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:26,959
Exactly.

145
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,620
So an example is a good way to demonstrate the word or the phrase.

146
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,300
Very good.

147
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,139
All right.

148
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,899
Why don't we listen to this dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

149
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,600
Hello everyone, and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.

150
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,680
First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for?

151
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,759
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.

152
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,699
That's right.

153
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,959
We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.

154
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,939
What does that mean?

155
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,819
Well, basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air, then we need to get them going again.

156
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,839
That's when we have to apply this procedure.

157
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:03,819
Let's begin.

158
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,120
I need a volunteer.

159
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,199
Me, me.

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,100
All right.

161
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,519
Come here and lay flat on your back.

162
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,720
Let's suppose this young woman has stopped breathing.

163
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,779
We must lift the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs.

164
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,519
Then, we place our mouth over the other person's mouth and blow air two or three times, like this.

165
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:21,819
Wait.

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,720
What are you doing?

167
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,819
I'm a married woman.

168
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,019
You can't just try to kiss me like that.

169
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,060
Ma'am, I'm not trying to kiss you.

170
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,259
I'm trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.

171
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,860
Well, okay.

172
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,439
No French kissing.

173
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,899
As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner.

174
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,639
Once this is done, we must try to get the heart going again.

175
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,759
To do this, we place our hands over the person's chest and press down firmly two or three times.

176
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,439
Wait.

177
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,220
What are you doing?

178
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,660
You can't just kiss me, then go for second base.

179
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,600
All right.

180
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:53,980
We're back.

181
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,160
So now, let's go with fluency builder.

182
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,720
Fluency builder.

183
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,360
Well, the first phrase in fluency builder we hear in the beginning of today's dialogue.

184
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,740
The teacher says, well, basically, if your heart stops pumping blood, then we need to get it going again.

185
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,399
Okay.

186
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,800
So that's a whole phrase there.

187
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,019
To get something going.

188
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,100
To get it going.

189
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,600
What do you mean by this?

190
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:17,720
This means to start it up again.

191
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:26,120
So we could say, I used to teach an English class for my colleagues, but we stopped having it.

192
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,800
I'd like to get it going again.

193
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,180
Okay.

194
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,199
So you'd like to start it up again.

195
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:30,759
Exactly.

196
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:35,580
So usually, you're talking about turning something on or getting something started.

197
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,080
For example, maybe your car won't start.

198
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,559
So if you push it, you can get it going.

199
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:41,480
Right.

200
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,259
To get it going or to turn the keys to get it going.

201
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:45,799
Right.

202
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,799
So to get something going.

203
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,360
Now, moving on, we have two key phrases here that are a little bit spicy, right?

204
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:53,980
Yeah.

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,980
They're very romantic.

206
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,840
Although, this is a CPR class, so it shouldn't be very romantic.

207
00:08:59,340 --> 00:08:59,480
All right.

208
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,659
Well, this phrase that we have coming up is French kiss.

209
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,340
To French kiss someone or a French kiss.

210
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,480
So the volunteer says, okay, I'm happy to help you, but no French kissing.

211
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,039
Okay.

212
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,960
So what is French kissing?

213
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,159
What is French kissing?

214
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,679
No one wants to answer.

215
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:14,519
All right.

216
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,139
What is it?

217
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,720
Well, it is when you kiss someone, but your tongue goes into that other person's mouth.

218
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,460
Ew.

219
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:23,860
All right.

220
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,000
So there's a normal kiss.

221
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,779
You can kiss your friends on the cheek, but a French kiss means that you use your tongue.

222
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,519
Okay.

223
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,940
So I wonder why they call it a French kiss.

224
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,379
Maybe Americans just were too shy.

225
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,580
They blamed it on the French.

226
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,980
Maybe the French listeners out there can tell us.

227
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,039
All right.

228
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,519
So now moving on.

229
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,679
And she says, okay, no French kissing.

230
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:50,860
Now the man is going to perform CPR and obviously he has to firmly press down on her chest to get her heart pumping blood, right?

231
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,100
Right.

232
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:52,460
This is a part of CPR.

233
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:59,500
So first of all, you try to give the person air so they can breathe and then you have to push their chest to start their heart.

234
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,039
And this woman, the volunteer says, hey, what are you doing?

235
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,440
You can't just kiss me first and then go for second base.

236
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,820
All right.

237
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,159
So what is second base?

238
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:10,620
Okay.

239
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,120
This is a sports metaphor.

240
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,440
With baseball, right?

241
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,440
Because baseball has four bases, first, second, third base and home plate.

242
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,019
Exactly.

243
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:29,259
So in romance, when we're talking about dating, we have a way to say first, second, third and fourth base.

244
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:30,960
First base is kissing.

245
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,879
That's kissing, right?

246
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,120
So second base, what would be second base?

247
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,019
Well, in this example, it means touching.

248
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:37,500
Touching.

249
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,519
Touching certain parts of the body, right?

250
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,220
Romantic touching.

251
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:46,139
All right, so second base and then obviously we have third and fourth, but we're not going to get into that now.

252
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,379
You can look it up on Google, third base and fourth base.

253
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:51,059
We trust that you can find it.

254
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,639
But first and second base are very common.

255
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,179
It's okay to talk about it.

256
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,080
It's not a bad word.

257
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,379
So you'll probably see it in movies, young kids talking about first base or going to second base with someone.

258
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,519
So it's kind of saying this in a different way as a metaphor, as you said.

259
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,559
It's more polite than talking about...

260
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,220
Yeah, more subtle.

261
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:14,340
All right, so that's all the words and phrases we have on Fluency Builder.

262
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,879
Let's listen to this great dialogue one last time.

263
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,779
Hello everyone and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.

264
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,919
First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for?

265
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,840
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.

266
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:33,539
That's right.

267
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:37,799
We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.

268
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,759
What does that mean?

269
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,659
Well, basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air, then we need to get them going again.

270
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:46,659
That's when we have to apply this procedure.

271
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:47,659
Let's begin.

272
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:48,960
I need a volunteer.

273
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:49,740
Me!

274
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,600
Me!

275
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,919
All right, come here and lay flat on your back.

276
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,960
Let's suppose this young woman has stopped breathing.

277
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,000
We must lift the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs.

278
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,820
Then, we place our mouth over the other person's mouth and blow air two or three times, like this.

279
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,059
Wait!

280
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,960
What are you doing?

281
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,080
I'm a married woman.

282
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,259
You can't just try to kiss me like that.

283
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,299
Ma'am, I'm not trying to kiss you.

284
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,500
I'm trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.

285
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,679
Well, okay, no French kissing.

286
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,360
As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner.

287
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,100
Once this is done, we must try to get the heart going again.

288
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,440
To do this, we place our hands over the person's chest and press down firmly two or three times.

289
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:32,899
Wait!

290
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:33,700
What are you doing?

291
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,100
You can't just kiss me, then go for second base.

292
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,379
All right, we're back.

293
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,580
So, a CPR class.

294
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,399
This is actually a very popular thing to take up.

295
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,580
You never know when you need to perform it, right?

296
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,080
That's true, and I think it's a really smart class to take.

297
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,940
You can usually take them for free at a community center or a fire department.

298
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:57,720
The Red Cross.

299
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,679
The Red Cross.

300
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,179
I have a Red Cross certification.

301
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:00,759
Oh, really?

302
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,879
So you know how to perform this?

303
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:02,700
Wow.

304
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,860
It's actually, as I said, I think it would be very useful.

305
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:10,580
I've never taken a course like this up, but I know how to perform the procedure.

306
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,639
I'm not certified, though, so I'm not a certified CPR person.

307
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:18,019
But it's interesting.

308
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:25,120
Let us know if in your country maybe you can take CPR classes, or maybe you're a CPR certified technician.

309
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,440
Or maybe you are trained in other ways, so we're curious about those as well.

310
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,360
Let us know if you have any questions about today's lesson.

311
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,419
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

312
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,519
All right, we'll see you guys there.

313
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,019
Bye, everyone.

314
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,259
Bye.
