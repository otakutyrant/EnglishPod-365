EnglishPod.com Hello everyone and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation That's right.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What does that mean?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's when we have to apply this procedure.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's begin.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I need a volunteer.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Me!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Me!

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Alright, come here and lay flat on your back.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's suppose this young woman has stopped breathing.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We must lift the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Then we place our mouth over the other person's mouth and blow air two or three times, like this.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Wait, what are you doing?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm a married woman.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You can't just try to kiss me like that.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Ma'am, I'm not trying to kiss you.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, okay.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No French kissing.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Once this is done, we must try to get the heart going again.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
To do this, we place our hands over the person's chest and press down firmly two or three times.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wait, what are you doing?

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You can't just kiss me then go for second base.
