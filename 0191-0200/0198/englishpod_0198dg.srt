EnglishPod.com Hello everyone and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,800
First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for?

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,439
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation That's right.

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,699
We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:20,660
What does that mean?

6
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,620
Well, basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air then we need to get them going again.

7
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,579
That's when we have to apply this procedure.

8
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:29,539
Let's begin.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,879
I need a volunteer.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:31,660
Me!

11
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:32,520
Me!

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,799
Alright, come here and lay flat on your back.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,840
Let's suppose this young woman has stopped breathing.

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,859
We must lift the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs.

15
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:48,700
Then we place our mouth over the other person's mouth and blow air two or three times, like this.

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,859
Wait, what are you doing?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,979
I'm a married woman.

18
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:53,179
You can't just try to kiss me like that.

19
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:55,200
Ma'am, I'm not trying to kiss you.

20
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,420
I'm trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,039
Well, okay.

22
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,579
No French kissing.

23
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,260
As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner.

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,980
Once this is done, we must try to get the heart going again.

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,280
To do this, we place our hands over the person's chest and press down firmly two or three times.

26
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:15,579
Wait, what are you doing?

27
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,920
You can't just kiss me then go for second base.
