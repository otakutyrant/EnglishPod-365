00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine and today we're looking for a new job.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We are looking for a new job and so we're bringing you this great lesson where we're going to teach you in English a lot of terms related with looking for a job or things like a resume, cover letter.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So before we get into that, why don't we take a look at a word that we have in Vocabulary Preview.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Vocabulary Preview.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So this is actually the name of a job.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's a position.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's a gas station attendant.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, a gas station attendant.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now we know what a gas station is, right?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's right.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's a place where you go to fill your car with gas.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So an attendant at a gas station, what does he do?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He or she is a person who will help you put the gas in your car.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So an attendant is someone who is almost like an assistant or a helper.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You can have a bathroom attendant, someone who gives you a towel after you wash your hands.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've seen those in the fancy restaurants.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, so gas station attendant.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
All right.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So why don't we take a look now at our dialogue.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's listen to it for the first time and we'll be back in a bit.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Woohoo!

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This just might be the start of the rest of my life.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What happened?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm in the market for a job.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I've even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And you know, I can be charming in interviews.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Goodbye my penniless days.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hello salary and a career.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ben, we're 15.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What kind of job are you looking for?

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You know, starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Uh-huh.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But I'm just in it for the money, right?

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies?

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Besides, I love the smell of gasoline, don't you?

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Alright, we're back.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So now you're probably wondering what those words meant.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So why don't we take a look at a couple of them in Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Language Takeaway.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The first phrase we have today is one that's very important when you're looking for a job.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's called job listing or job listings here.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay, job listings.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And this is really common before the internet existed.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You would have the listings in your local newspaper, right?

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Exactly.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
In the movies, you always had the person sitting with the newspaper circling the potential jobs.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Right, with a red marker.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Exactly.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But now that we have the internet, you have lots of websites that have job listings.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And so a job listing is literally a list of jobs that are available.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So you look through the job listings.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Maybe you found one that's interesting.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
There's an email address.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So what do they ask for?

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They ask you to send in your resume.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, a resume is very important when you're looking for a job.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's a document.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's a piece of paper that tells someone all of the work that you've done before, your job experiences, and it tells them where you went to school and what your qualifications are.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So it's a summary of your work life.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay, and that's why it's called a resume, right?

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's pretty much a summary of your work life, as you say.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's right.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And a different one, sometimes people use this, is a CV, curriculum vitae, and that's an academic summary of your life.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So you have the work summary and the study summary.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, very good.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So if you send in your resume, what's recommended is that you attach it with a cover letter.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay, well, cover letter, you know the word letter.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's something that you write to somebody else.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But a cover letter is like a cover for your resume.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's a letter where you explain to the future boss or future employer what exactly you want and how this job is going to help you get it.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, so that's basically a small little introduction to yourself, right?

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Before they read your resume, who you are, what you're looking for, maybe, very quickly.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Exactly, so you can say, hi, my name is Catherine.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm very motivated and excited to have the opportunity to talk to you about why I'm a skilled employee and why I will benefit your company.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Very good.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
All right, so you've sent in your resume and your cover letter, and, well, maybe you're looking to get into a career as a gas station attendant.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So what's the difference between job and career?

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay, and this is very interesting because in many languages there is a similar word, which, for example, in Spanish is carrera, right?

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And that means, like, a profession.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So many people translate it literally as career, but it's not the right word.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What is a career?

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
A career I think of as a long-term goal.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
A career is your profession.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's the name you give yourself.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But a job is a position in a company from one time to another.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So, for example, my job here is host of EnglishPod.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But maybe in the future I will have a media career.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That means that my job or jobs will have to do with this profession.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's kind of a bigger thing, a longer thing.

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So maybe you can think of it this way.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
A career is like, as you say, a bigger picture, like the macro category.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're into media and television, for example.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And your job specifically is a podcast host.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But in the future maybe I want to have a different job in this career and move into production and be a TV producer.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So that's a part of my career path.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I can move forward.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So career is a very important word.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
All right.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So we've taken a look at a couple of great words.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Woohoo!

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This just might be the start of the rest of my life.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What happened?

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm in the market for a job.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I've even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And you know, I can be charming in interviews.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Goodbye my penniless days.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hello salary and a career.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Ben, we're 15.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What kind of job are you looking for?

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You know, starting at a simple lowly job, just like all the greats before they made it big in the world.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Uh huh.

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But I'm just in it for the money, right?

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies?

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Besides, I love the smell of gasoline, don't you?

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Alright, we're back.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So now we have lined up for you three key phrases that we found in this dialogue.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This first one's a great phrase.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's going to make you sound very fluent in English if you use it.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We say, in the market for.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm in the market for a new job.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Alright, so this person is looking for a new job.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He is in the market for.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I could also say, I'm in the market for a new house.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Marco, do you know any good real estate agents?

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So what does that mean if you say I'm in the market for a new job or you're in the market for a new house?

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I am right now actively looking for this thing.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I really want one.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're available.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay.

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So I'm in the market for a new job.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm in the market for a new car.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It means the market is the marketplace.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Right, right.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And this sometimes you could see it related in movies, for example.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They say if a person gets married, they are no longer in the market.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Or I'm in the market for a husband.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Right.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you know any nice guys?

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Alright.

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So you're in the market, you're looking for a job.

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And well, if you're qualified, it will be a piece of cake to find a new job.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Isn't this a delicious phrase?

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So piece of cake, you think, what does cake have to do with anything?

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, cake, this is a way to say something is easy.

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay.

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's really easy.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This often happens in our office, actually, because you and I understand computers, but we work with someone who has a hard time with computers.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And she says, oh, it doesn't work.

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And we're like, it's a piece of cake.

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's a piece of cake.

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's so easy.

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Why is this hard?

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So a piece of cake is a way to say something simple, easy.

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And it's a very, very, very common phrase.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You'll hear it all the time.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Ah, piece of cake, don't worry about it.

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Piece of cake.

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hey, can you help me out with this thing?

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Sure, it's a piece of cake.

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Alright.

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And for our last phrase, he was talking about his position as a gas attendant.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And he said, well, you know, all the greats, all the famous people, they started somewhere before they made it big.

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What does he mean with they made it big?

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, the phrase to make it big, or in here in the past tense, made it big, means to be successful.

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So we're talking about, for example, Albert Einstein.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Albert Einstein worked in the patent office.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He was a clerk in Europe.

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And, you know, that's not a very impressive job, but it was a job.

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And he made it big later on as a physicist.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And so to make it big is to succeed, to become famous or successful or important.

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Or sometimes people say, yeah, I made it.

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I made it big.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Or I made it in my life.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And that means that you were successful.

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Or this product is going to make it big.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's going to be really successful.

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, that's good.

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, so it's a key phrase to make it or to make it big.

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back in a little bit.

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Woo hoo!

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This just might be the start of the rest of my life.

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What happened?

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm in the market for a job.

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for.

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I have the resume I wrote for English class last month, and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write.

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I've even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And you know, I can be charming in interviews.

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Goodbye my penniless days.

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hello salary and a career.

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ben, we're 15.

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What kind of job are you looking for?

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant.

208
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You know, starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world.

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Uh huh.

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But I'm just in it for the money, right?

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies?

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Besides, I love the smell of gasoline, don't you?

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Alright, so talking about jobs.

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Now I noticed something that in the United States, unlike many other countries, there are no gas station attendants anymore.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There are.

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Touché, there are actually a lot of gas station attendants in New Jersey because it's the law that you cannot pump your own gas.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh wow.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You cannot put gas in your own car.

219
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why is that?

220
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's a way for the New Jersey government to increase the amount of jobs in the States.

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So to create jobs, they made gas station attendants.

222
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh wow.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah, I've noticed in some states, for example, you just go up to the pump and if you have your credit card, you put in your credit card and you pump your own gas.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And apparently it also has to do with health issues because people who are working in gas stations tend to have serious health problems later on.

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I mean, you're inhaling all these gases from the gasoline.

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's right, it's very unhealthy and I think that it's also very dangerous in some places because gas stations are often robbed.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Because there's only one person and no security sometimes.

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So there are some negative parts of being a gas station attendant.

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But if it's a job and you need a job, it's probably a good one.

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah, no, true.

232
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Actually, I remember seeing Back to the Future when in the 50s, you would pull up to a gas station and somebody would check your tire pressure, they would check your oil and they would clean your windows and it's just like full service when you pulled up to a gas station.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
They might even buy you a beer.

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,000
All right.

235
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So it's really interesting about these positions.

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I imagine that in other places, some job positions that maybe we would find a little bit strange or uncommon.

237
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Absolutely.

238
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And I encourage everyone today, this is your homework.

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Tell us on EnglishPod.com what is your job and what's your career, okay?

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What's your job and what's your career?

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So what's the career you would like to have in the future?

242
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Very good.

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
All right, so we'll see you guys there.

244
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Bye everyone.

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Bye.
