00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:05,740
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,199
My name is Catherine and today we're looking for a new job.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,060
That's right.

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:22,300
We are looking for a new job and so we're bringing you this great lesson where we're going to teach you in English a lot of terms related with looking for a job or things like a resume, cover letter.

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,679
So before we get into that, why don't we take a look at a word that we have in Vocabulary Preview.

7
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:30,300
Vocabulary Preview.

8
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,700
So this is actually the name of a job.

9
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:34,700
It's a position.

10
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,179
It's a gas station attendant.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,479
Okay, a gas station attendant.

12
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,539
Now we know what a gas station is, right?

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,060
That's right.

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,840
It's a place where you go to fill your car with gas.

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,219
Okay.

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,200
So an attendant at a gas station, what does he do?

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,899
He or she is a person who will help you put the gas in your car.

18
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,960
So an attendant is someone who is almost like an assistant or a helper.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,700
Okay.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,159
You can have a bathroom attendant, someone who gives you a towel after you wash your hands.

21
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,740
I've seen those in the fancy restaurants.

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,680
Yeah, so gas station attendant.

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,420
All right.

24
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,200
So why don't we take a look now at our dialogue.

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
Let's listen to it for the first time and we'll be back in a bit.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:19,939
Woohoo!

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,200
This just might be the start of the rest of my life.

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,079
What happened?

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,420
I'm in the market for a job.

30
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:34,819
I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for.

31
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:40,640
I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write.

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,439
I've even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,819
And you know, I can be charming in interviews.

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,200
Goodbye my penniless days.

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,340
Hello salary and a career.

36
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,060
Ben, we're 15.

37
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,939
What kind of job are you looking for?

38
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:00,519
Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant.

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,640
You know, starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world.

40
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:07,760
Uh-huh.

41
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,759
But I'm just in it for the money, right?

42
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,659
How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies?

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,439
Besides, I love the smell of gasoline, don't you?

44
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,039
Alright, we're back.

45
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,939
So now you're probably wondering what those words meant.

46
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,620
So why don't we take a look at a couple of them in Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:32,280
Language Takeaway.

48
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,560
The first phrase we have today is one that's very important when you're looking for a job.

49
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,520
It's called job listing or job listings here.

50
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:42,960
Okay, job listings.

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,159
And this is really common before the internet existed.

52
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,139
You would have the listings in your local newspaper, right?

53
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:50,699
Exactly.

54
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,319
In the movies, you always had the person sitting with the newspaper circling the potential jobs.

55
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:57,699
Right, with a red marker.

56
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Exactly.

57
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,159
But now that we have the internet, you have lots of websites that have job listings.

58
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,800
And so a job listing is literally a list of jobs that are available.

59
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,379
Okay.

60
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,300
So you look through the job listings.

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,860
Maybe you found one that's interesting.

62
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,020
There's an email address.

63
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,180
So what do they ask for?

64
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,060
They ask you to send in your resume.

65
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,979
Okay, a resume is very important when you're looking for a job.

66
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,900
It's a document.

67
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:31,979
It's a piece of paper that tells someone all of the work that you've done before, your job experiences, and it tells them where you went to school and what your qualifications are.

68
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,759
So it's a summary of your work life.

69
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,080
Okay, and that's why it's called a resume, right?

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,379
It's pretty much a summary of your work life, as you say.

71
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,639
That's right.

72
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:48,719
And a different one, sometimes people use this, is a CV, curriculum vitae, and that's an academic summary of your life.

73
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,000
So you have the work summary and the study summary.

74
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,379
Okay, very good.

75
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,620
So if you send in your resume, what's recommended is that you attach it with a cover letter.

76
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,900
Okay, well, cover letter, you know the word letter.

77
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,240
It's something that you write to somebody else.

78
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,259
But a cover letter is like a cover for your resume.

79
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:16,980
It's a letter where you explain to the future boss or future employer what exactly you want and how this job is going to help you get it.

80
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,639
Okay, so that's basically a small little introduction to yourself, right?

81
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,439
Before they read your resume, who you are, what you're looking for, maybe, very quickly.

82
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Exactly, so you can say, hi, my name is Catherine.

83
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:37,180
I'm very motivated and excited to have the opportunity to talk to you about why I'm a skilled employee and why I will benefit your company.

84
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,040
Very good.

85
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:46,060
All right, so you've sent in your resume and your cover letter, and, well, maybe you're looking to get into a career as a gas station attendant.

86
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,939
So what's the difference between job and career?

87
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:58,699
Okay, and this is very interesting because in many languages there is a similar word, which, for example, in Spanish is carrera, right?

88
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,279
And that means, like, a profession.

89
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,759
So many people translate it literally as career, but it's not the right word.

90
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,860
What is a career?

91
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,879
A career I think of as a long-term goal.

92
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,180
A career is your profession.

93
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,079
It's the name you give yourself.

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,560
But a job is a position in a company from one time to another.

95
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,439
So, for example, my job here is host of EnglishPod.

96
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,879
But maybe in the future I will have a media career.

97
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,220
That means that my job or jobs will have to do with this profession.

98
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,759
It's kind of a bigger thing, a longer thing.

99
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,339
So maybe you can think of it this way.

100
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,180
A career is like, as you say, a bigger picture, like the macro category.

101
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:46,420
You're into media and television, for example.

102
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,959
And your job specifically is a podcast host.

103
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:58,339
But in the future maybe I want to have a different job in this career and move into production and be a TV producer.

104
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,000
So that's a part of my career path.

105
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,620
I can move forward.

106
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,639
So career is a very important word.

107
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,379
All right.

108
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:08,240
So we've taken a look at a couple of great words.

109
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:12,360
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

110
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,000
Woohoo!

111
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,259
This just might be the start of the rest of my life.

112
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,180
What happened?

113
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,500
I'm in the market for a job.

114
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:31,920
I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for.

115
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,740
I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write.

116
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,540
I've even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally.

117
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,899
And you know, I can be charming in interviews.

118
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,240
Goodbye my penniless days.

119
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,420
Hello salary and a career.

120
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,139
Ben, we're 15.

121
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,060
What kind of job are you looking for?

122
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:57,620
Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant.

123
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,740
You know, starting at a simple lowly job, just like all the greats before they made it big in the world.

124
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,819
Uh huh.

125
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:06,839
But I'm just in it for the money, right?

126
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,740
How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies?

127
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,540
Besides, I love the smell of gasoline, don't you?

128
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,800
Alright, we're back.

129
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,899
So now we have lined up for you three key phrases that we found in this dialogue.

130
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:25,439
So let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

131
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,220
This first one's a great phrase.

132
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:33,620
It's going to make you sound very fluent in English if you use it.

133
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,699
We say, in the market for.

134
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,139
I'm in the market for a new job.

135
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:41,839
Alright, so this person is looking for a new job.

136
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,000
He is in the market for.

137
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,819
I could also say, I'm in the market for a new house.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,319
Marco, do you know any good real estate agents?

139
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,920
So what does that mean if you say I'm in the market for a new job or you're in the market for a new house?

140
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,959
I am right now actively looking for this thing.

141
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:01,040
I really want one.

142
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:01,920
You're available.

143
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:02,500
Yes.

144
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,120
Okay.

145
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,319
So I'm in the market for a new job.

146
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,120
I'm in the market for a new car.

147
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,100
It means the market is the marketplace.

148
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,500
Right, right.

149
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,579
And this sometimes you could see it related in movies, for example.

150
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,420
They say if a person gets married, they are no longer in the market.

151
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,600
Or I'm in the market for a husband.

152
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:24,040
Right.

153
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,180
Do you know any nice guys?

154
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,480
Alright.

155
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,259
So you're in the market, you're looking for a job.

156
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,820
And well, if you're qualified, it will be a piece of cake to find a new job.

157
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:35,940
Isn't this a delicious phrase?

158
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,539
So piece of cake, you think, what does cake have to do with anything?

159
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,419
Well, cake, this is a way to say something is easy.

160
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:43,659
Okay.

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,159
It's really easy.

162
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:51,980
This often happens in our office, actually, because you and I understand computers, but we work with someone who has a hard time with computers.

163
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,179
And she says, oh, it doesn't work.

164
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:55,899
And we're like, it's a piece of cake.

165
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:56,960
It's a piece of cake.

166
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,980
It's so easy.

167
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,179
Why is this hard?

168
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,899
So a piece of cake is a way to say something simple, easy.

169
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,279
And it's a very, very, very common phrase.

170
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,379
You'll hear it all the time.

171
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,299
Ah, piece of cake, don't worry about it.

172
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:08,919
Piece of cake.

173
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,559
Hey, can you help me out with this thing?

174
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,740
Sure, it's a piece of cake.

175
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:12,879
Alright.

176
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,080
And for our last phrase, he was talking about his position as a gas attendant.

177
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,899
And he said, well, you know, all the greats, all the famous people, they started somewhere before they made it big.

178
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,480
What does he mean with they made it big?

179
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,980
Well, the phrase to make it big, or in here in the past tense, made it big, means to be successful.

180
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,980
So we're talking about, for example, Albert Einstein.

181
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:40,120
Albert Einstein worked in the patent office.

182
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,779
He was a clerk in Europe.

183
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,500
And, you know, that's not a very impressive job, but it was a job.

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,220
And he made it big later on as a physicist.

185
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,480
And so to make it big is to succeed, to become famous or successful or important.

186
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,200
Or sometimes people say, yeah, I made it.

187
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:00,960
I made it big.

188
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Or I made it in my life.

189
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,960
And that means that you were successful.

190
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,340
Or this product is going to make it big.

191
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,039
It's going to be really successful.

192
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:08,799
Yeah, that's good.

193
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,919
Okay, so it's a key phrase to make it or to make it big.

194
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,679
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back in a little bit.

195
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:25,120
Woo hoo!

196
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,379
This just might be the start of the rest of my life.

197
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,259
What happened?

198
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,620
I'm in the market for a job.

199
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:40,019
I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for.

200
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,860
I have the resume I wrote for English class last month, and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write.

201
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,659
I've even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally.

202
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:54,059
And you know, I can be charming in interviews.

203
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,399
Goodbye my penniless days.

204
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,559
Hello salary and a career.

205
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:00,279
Ben, we're 15.

206
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,159
What kind of job are you looking for?

207
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,759
Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant.

208
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:11,860
You know, starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big in the world.

209
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:12,980
Uh huh.

210
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,980
But I'm just in it for the money, right?

211
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:18,879
How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies?

212
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,840
Besides, I love the smell of gasoline, don't you?

213
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,779
Alright, so talking about jobs.

214
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,279
Now I noticed something that in the United States, unlike many other countries, there are no gas station attendants anymore.

215
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:36,940
There are.

216
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:46,059
Touché, there are actually a lot of gas station attendants in New Jersey because it's the law that you cannot pump your own gas.

217
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:46,299
Oh wow.

218
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:47,500
You cannot put gas in your own car.

219
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,179
Why is that?

220
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,399
It's a way for the New Jersey government to increase the amount of jobs in the States.

221
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,740
So to create jobs, they made gas station attendants.

222
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,320
Oh wow.

223
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Yeah, I've noticed in some states, for example, you just go up to the pump and if you have your credit card, you put in your credit card and you pump your own gas.

224
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:14,200
And apparently it also has to do with health issues because people who are working in gas stations tend to have serious health problems later on.

225
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,059
I mean, you're inhaling all these gases from the gasoline.

226
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:25,419
That's right, it's very unhealthy and I think that it's also very dangerous in some places because gas stations are often robbed.

227
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,039
Yeah.

228
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,980
Because there's only one person and no security sometimes.

229
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,139
So there are some negative parts of being a gas station attendant.

230
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,799
But if it's a job and you need a job, it's probably a good one.

231
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,740
Yeah, no, true.

232
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:52,059
Actually, I remember seeing Back to the Future when in the 50s, you would pull up to a gas station and somebody would check your tire pressure, they would check your oil and they would clean your windows and it's just like full service when you pulled up to a gas station.

233
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,419
They might even buy you a beer.

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,240
All right.

235
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,019
So it's really interesting about these positions.

236
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:04,700
I imagine that in other places, some job positions that maybe we would find a little bit strange or uncommon.

237
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,559
Absolutely.

238
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,639
And I encourage everyone today, this is your homework.

239
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,899
Tell us on EnglishPod.com what is your job and what's your career, okay?

240
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,700
What's your job and what's your career?

241
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,700
So what's the career you would like to have in the future?

242
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:21,360
Very good.

243
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,879
All right, so we'll see you guys there.

244
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:23,879
Bye everyone.

245
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:24,299
Bye.
