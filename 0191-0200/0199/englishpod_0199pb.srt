00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And my name is Catherine and today we might just teach you how to save a life.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right, we're going to save a life and we are going to do this by applying first aid.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So let's take a look at vocabulary preview and find out just exactly what this phrase means.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay, so we have this word first aid.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's two parts.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So first is...

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Before.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Before.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Early.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Early, alright.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And aid.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So when you aid someone, you help them, right?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Right, so this is actually a noun.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Aid is help.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So we're applying first aid.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This means we're the first person to come and help someone.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So for example, if someone is bleeding, the first aid is to stop the bleeding.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Alright, so first aid.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We're going to learn all about this.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Alright, we're back.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So...

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It was intense.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I can imagine.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I tend to faint when I see blood so I think I won't be taking up a course like that any time soon.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All right, we're back.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So there are a lot of medical and like health-related terms in this dialogue, so why don't we take a look at a couple of those in Language Takeaway?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Language Takeaway.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, starting us out here in Language Takeaway, we have the name of an organization that's not-for-profit, that's very, very, very famous.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is called the Red Cross.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, so the Red Cross, and this is usually a place where you donate blood, you can also get some blood exams done.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What else do you do there?

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, the Red Cross is an organization that has offices and clinics all over the world, and if you want to help, you can volunteer, you can donate money, and you can donate blood.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But the Red Cross will take this and it will help other people, people who have been in disasters or wars.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And so maybe the Red Cross office near you will have blood banks and blood donations, but really they help people, they provide aid to people who are unhealthy or sick or have been in a war.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
A very humanitarian organization, so worth it, go to the Red Cross and donate blood.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In the dialogue, the two people are discussing real emergencies, and one person says he went along with some paramedics.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So a paramedic is a person.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a person, it's a profession, right, to be a paramedic.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Exactly, but it's not really a doctor, so what's the difference here?

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So paramedics are something like nurses, right, that travel in an ambulance and get to an emergency or get to the scene of an accident and help out a person, so they immobilize the person, they give them oxygen, they make sure that they stay alive until they reach the hospital.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay, so a paramedic, you might hear the word medic, it's the same thing, a paramedic is like a nurse.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
They're not a doctor, but they're usually the first person to help when there's been an accident or a disaster.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Right, exactly, so if there is an earthquake and many people are stuck in the buildings, usually paramedics will be the ones on the scene trying to get them out and helping them by applying first aid.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Great, well after that we have finally some of the injuries that a paramedic might see.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The first injury is usually associated with the head.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is called a concussion.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You suffered a concussion.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sounds painful.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, it does, and actually it's very common, I think, right, if you fall and you hit your head.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's right, so a concussion is really when your brain hits your skull, that's the bone that protects your brain, so really you're hitting your head really, really hard, and usually this can have some bad side effects, like you lose your memory or you're a little bit confused.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's very common with football players.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, yeah, with any contact sport, if people suffer concussions, and it's just like, imagine when you have a DVD player and you hit it and the disc skips or it goes back.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's kind of what happens to your brain, so you can suffer memory loss.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can even lose your sight temporarily.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's right, so this can be very serious and obviously should be looked at by a paramedic.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We also have another situation that is similarly serious.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's called a compound fracture.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay, so what is a fracture or to fracture?

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:16,000
A fracture is a thing, it's a break, okay, so you could say, I broke my arm, but you could also say, I fractured my arm, this is the more medical term, but of course there are different ways to break something, and so in medicine we have a compound fracture.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So a compound fracture is pretty painful and it's a little bit more serious.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You have a simple fracture, which is when your bone just breaks.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Or a hairline, which means that there's a little thin part where it's broken, but it's not really serious.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
In this case, it's your bones actually push towards each other, they kind of form like a little mountain, right, or they're on top of each other.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Think about when two cars hit and they kind of crash up into each other.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's like that, but it's your bone, so it's extremely painful.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, it's very, very painful.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So the person suffered a concussion and a compound fracture.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Now the friend that he was talking to said, wow, you know, it sounds amazing, it's really cool that you're doing that, but you know what, I faint when I see blood.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do you do this?

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No.

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No, me neither.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, some people when they see blood, they feel very, very uncomfortable or sick, and so to faint is to fall down on the ground.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's almost like you're falling asleep, but it's not sleep.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Have you ever fainted?

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I fainted twice in my life.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
One time I fainted because of heat, it was very, very, very hot, and I couldn't breathe for a moment, and then I woke up on the ground.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Wow, yeah.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's what happens.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Exactly.

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So yeah, if you ever faint, it's basically that you're just standing there, you're sitting somewhere and all of a sudden everything goes black and you wake up and you're on the ground.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And you feel very, very weak before that.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And very pale, I think, as well, because you look pale.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Your blood goes away from your brain and you pass out.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a very strange sensation because then everyone else around you, they know what happened.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They saw you, and so they're looking at you like you're crazy or maybe sick.

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
To faint.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,000
All right.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So that's to faint.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So those are the keywords that we have for you in Language Takeaway.

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's take a listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back shortly to take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Cool.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I've always wanted to do something like that.

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Have you learnt anything useful?

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
For sure.

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I mean, we learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding, how to check for a pulse, and even how to apply CPR.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Have you treated any real emergencies?

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, they took us along with some paramedics.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures.

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
His wounds were pretty serious, so they had to rush him to the hospital.

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It was intense.

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can imagine.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I tend to faint when I see blood, so I think I won't be taking up a course like that anytime soon.

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
All right.

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So quiz, Marco.

115
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What is the first thing that a paramedic does when he or she finds a body at an emergency?

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That paramedic checks for a pulse to make sure you're alive, right?

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Right.

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
A pulse.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So, dum, dum, dum, dum.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The pulse is the rhythm, that's the sound of your heart pumping blood, and you can feel someone's wrist or their throat.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So to check for a pulse means to check and make sure their heart is pumping blood.

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And not only that, but to make sure that the heart is pumping blood relatively normal because sometimes your heart can be pumping blood too fast or too slow.

123
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And if it's too slow, it's very possible that you will faint.

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Very good.

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
All right.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So we check for a pulse.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now, what else happens?

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, if there's a very serious emergency and the paramedic needs help to give aid to the person who is injured, then they will rush that person to the hospital.

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So the verb, to rush.

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What does that mean?

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
All right.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So to rush someone or to rush someone to the hospital means to take someone or to go with someone very, very quickly.

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay.

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So let's give an example.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I could say, listen, Marco, I don't want to rush you, but I really need the report done today.

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Or I could say, I need to rush home.

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
My parents need me.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Or if a woman is having a baby, you want to rush her to the emergency room.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay.

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So you need to go quickly.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
All right.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Now, when we were talking about fainting, the person said, before he used the word faint, he said, I tend to faint.

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I tend to.

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I tend to is a really great verb that describes a normal or habitual behavior.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's like saying, I tend to faint when it's very, very hot outside.

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That means I often faint when it's very, very hot outside.

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's something that happens normally.

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So it's a tendency.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Right.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But it's not for everyone.

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's for me.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So I tend to.

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What's something that you tend to faint when you see?

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I never faint.

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You don't faint?

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Not a man.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
No.

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Just kidding.

160
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But you know what?

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I tend to leave the towel on the bed sometimes after I take a shower.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I know.

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's a bad habit.

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And then the sheets smell.

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No, they don't.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because I leave it there for like five or 10 minutes and then I realize I'm like, oh my God.

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And then I pick it up.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But you know, it's hard.

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's gross.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No, it's not.

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, I tend to forget my leftover food in the refrigerator for a long time.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And then it starts to smell.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's gross.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But I don't like to waste food.

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But you like let it rot and then your fridge smells.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It happens.

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So that's all we've got for Fluency Builder today.

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But we can talk about tendencies in a moment.

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Maybe a homework assignment could be to think of something that you tend to do.

180
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's right.

181
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That could be an interesting homework assignment.

182
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But before we jump into that, why don't we listen to our dialogue for the very last time?

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hey, Joe, where have you been these past few days?

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I've been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross.

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Cool.

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I've always wanted to do something like that.

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Have you learned anything useful?

188
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
For sure.

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I mean, we learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding, how to check for a pulse and even how to apply CPR.

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Have you treated any real emergencies?

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, they took us along with some paramedics.

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures.

193
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
His wounds were pretty serious, so they had to rush him to the hospital.

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It was intense.

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I can imagine.

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I tend to faint when I see blood, so I think I won't be taking up a course like that anytime soon.

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
All right, we're back.

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So that's all the time we have for today.

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Be sure to do your homework assignment.

200
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Come to EnglishPod.com.

201
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
In the comments section, tell us, what do you tend to do?

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It could be a good thing.

203
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It could be a bad thing.

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Obviously, you can try and use some of the vocabulary you heard in today's lesson about health and safety, and you might get some extra points from us for doing that.

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I know some people who tend to leave the house with a whole medicine kit in their bags or in their purses.

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Really?

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We could say a first aid kit.

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
A first aid kit, exactly.

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Wow.

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So do you do this?

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Let us know.

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's all we've got for today, so until next time.

214
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Bye.

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Bye, guys.

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Bye.
