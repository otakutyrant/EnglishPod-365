00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:05,500
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:10,580
And my name is Catherine and today we might just teach you how to save a life.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,080
That's right, we're going to save a life and we are going to do this by applying first aid.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,760
So let's take a look at vocabulary preview and find out just exactly what this phrase means.

6
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:23,359
Vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,579
Okay, so we have this word first aid.

8
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:27,359
It's two parts.

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,179
So first is...

10
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:29,260
Before.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:29,879
Before.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,339
Early.

13
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:31,120
Early, alright.

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:31,940
And aid.

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,159
So when you aid someone, you help them, right?

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,659
Right, so this is actually a noun.

17
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,859
Aid is help.

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,380
So we're applying first aid.

19
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,579
This means we're the first person to come and help someone.

20
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,479
So for example, if someone is bleeding, the first aid is to stop the bleeding.

21
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,240
Okay.

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:48,619
Alright, so first aid.

23
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:49,859
We're going to learn all about this.

24
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:52,859
Take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,739
Okay, so we're going to learn even how to apply CPR.

26
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:19,859
Have you treated any real emergencies?

27
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,180
Well, they took us along with some paramedics.

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,719
There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures.

29
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:30,980
His wounds were pretty serious, so they had to rush him to the hospital.

30
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,040
It was intense.

31
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,200
I can imagine.

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,120
I tend to faint when I see blood, so I think I won't be taking up a course like that any time soon.

33
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:45,599
All right, we're back.

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:52,620
So there are a lot of medical and like health-related terms in this dialogue, so why don't we take a look at a couple of those in Language Takeaway?

35
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,319
Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:04,819
Well, starting us out here in Language Takeaway, we have the name of an organization that's not-for-profit, that's very, very, very famous.

37
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:06,719
This is called the Red Cross.

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:07,540
Okay.

39
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:17,699
Okay, so the Red Cross, and this is usually a place where you donate blood, you can also get some blood exams done.

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,520
What else do you do there?

41
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:30,500
Well, the Red Cross is an organization that has offices and clinics all over the world, and if you want to help, you can volunteer, you can donate money, and you can donate blood.

42
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:37,620
But the Red Cross will take this and it will help other people, people who have been in disasters or wars.

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:51,060
And so maybe the Red Cross office near you will have blood banks and blood donations, but really they help people, they provide aid to people who are unhealthy or sick or have been in a war.

44
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,060
A very humanitarian organization, so worth it, go to the Red Cross and donate blood.

45
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,419
In the dialogue, the two people are discussing real emergencies, and one person says he went along with some paramedics.

46
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,659
So a paramedic is a person.

47
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,340
It's a person, it's a profession, right, to be a paramedic.

48
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,039
Exactly, but it's not really a doctor, so what's the difference here?

49
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:26,659
So paramedics are something like nurses, right, that travel in an ambulance and get to an emergency or get to the scene of an accident and help out a person, so they immobilize the person, they give them oxygen, they make sure that they stay alive until they reach the hospital.

50
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:32,960
Okay, so a paramedic, you might hear the word medic, it's the same thing, a paramedic is like a nurse.

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:40,900
They're not a doctor, but they're usually the first person to help when there's been an accident or a disaster.

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:51,819
Right, exactly, so if there is an earthquake and many people are stuck in the buildings, usually paramedics will be the ones on the scene trying to get them out and helping them by applying first aid.

53
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,280
Great, well after that we have finally some of the injuries that a paramedic might see.

54
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,659
The first injury is usually associated with the head.

55
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,060
This is called a concussion.

56
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,659
You suffered a concussion.

57
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,039
Sounds painful.

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,379
Yeah, it does, and actually it's very common, I think, right, if you fall and you hit your head.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:27,660
That's right, so a concussion is really when your brain hits your skull, that's the bone that protects your brain, so really you're hitting your head really, really hard, and usually this can have some bad side effects, like you lose your memory or you're a little bit confused.

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,079
It's very common with football players.

61
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:40,300
Yeah, yeah, with any contact sport, if people suffer concussions, and it's just like, imagine when you have a DVD player and you hit it and the disc skips or it goes back.

62
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,079
That's kind of what happens to your brain, so you can suffer memory loss.

63
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,720
You can even lose your sight temporarily.

64
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,759
That's right, so this can be very serious and obviously should be looked at by a paramedic.

65
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,600
We also have another situation that is similarly serious.

66
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:56,680
It's called a compound fracture.

67
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,980
Okay, so what is a fracture or to fracture?

68
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:16,620
A fracture is a thing, it's a break, okay, so you could say, I broke my arm, but you could also say, I fractured my arm, this is the more medical term, but of course there are different ways to break something, and so in medicine we have a compound fracture.

69
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,160
So a compound fracture is pretty painful and it's a little bit more serious.

70
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,060
You have a simple fracture, which is when your bone just breaks.

71
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:30,079
Or a hairline, which means that there's a little thin part where it's broken, but it's not really serious.

72
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:38,600
In this case, it's your bones actually push towards each other, they kind of form like a little mountain, right, or they're on top of each other.

73
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,579
Think about when two cars hit and they kind of crash up into each other.

74
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,120
It's like that, but it's your bone, so it's extremely painful.

75
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,800
Yeah, it's very, very painful.

76
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,139
So the person suffered a concussion and a compound fracture.

77
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:59,339
Now the friend that he was talking to said, wow, you know, it sounds amazing, it's really cool that you're doing that, but you know what, I faint when I see blood.

78
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,060
Do you do this?

79
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,379
No.

80
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:02,180
No, me neither.

81
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:10,540
Well, some people when they see blood, they feel very, very uncomfortable or sick, and so to faint is to fall down on the ground.

82
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,740
It's almost like you're falling asleep, but it's not sleep.

83
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,319
Have you ever fainted?

84
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,100
I fainted twice in my life.

85
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:27,579
One time I fainted because of heat, it was very, very, very hot, and I couldn't breathe for a moment, and then I woke up on the ground.

86
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:28,600
Wow, yeah.

87
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

88
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,720
That's what happens.

89
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,339
Exactly.

90
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:38,360
So yeah, if you ever faint, it's basically that you're just standing there, you're sitting somewhere and all of a sudden everything goes black and you wake up and you're on the ground.

91
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,839
And you feel very, very weak before that.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,759
And very pale, I think, as well, because you look pale.

93
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,420
Your blood goes away from your brain and you pass out.

94
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:52,259
It's a very strange sensation because then everyone else around you, they know what happened.

95
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,399
They saw you, and so they're looking at you like you're crazy or maybe sick.

96
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:57,899
To faint.

97
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,560
All right.

98
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,740
So that's to faint.

99
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:03,220
So those are the keywords that we have for you in Language Takeaway.

100
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,519
Let's take a listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back shortly to take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

101
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross.

102
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:20,759
Cool.

103
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:23,100
I've always wanted to do something like that.

104
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,480
Have you learnt anything useful?

105
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,339
For sure.

106
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,639
I mean, we learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding, how to check for a pulse, and even how to apply CPR.

107
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,759
Have you treated any real emergencies?

108
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,079
Well, they took us along with some paramedics.

109
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,660
There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures.

110
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,899
His wounds were pretty serious, so they had to rush him to the hospital.

111
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:45,939
It was intense.

112
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,120
I can imagine.

113
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,040
I tend to faint when I see blood, so I think I won't be taking up a course like that anytime soon.

114
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,000
All right.

115
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,459
So quiz, Marco.

116
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:03,079
What is the first thing that a paramedic does when he or she finds a body at an emergency?

117
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:06,959
That paramedic checks for a pulse to make sure you're alive, right?

118
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:07,379
Right.

119
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:07,959
A pulse.

120
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:10,600
So, dum, dum, dum, dum.

121
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:18,959
The pulse is the rhythm, that's the sound of your heart pumping blood, and you can feel someone's wrist or their throat.

122
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,000
So to check for a pulse means to check and make sure their heart is pumping blood.

123
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:35,000
And not only that, but to make sure that the heart is pumping blood relatively normal because sometimes your heart can be pumping blood too fast or too slow.

124
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:38,279
And if it's too slow, it's very possible that you will faint.

125
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,539
Very good.

126
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,299
All right.

127
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,460
So we check for a pulse.

128
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,179
Now, what else happens?

129
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:52,519
Well, if there's a very serious emergency and the paramedic needs help to give aid to the person who is injured, then they will rush that person to the hospital.

130
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,840
So the verb, to rush.

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,899
What does that mean?

132
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:56,299
All right.

133
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:03,840
So to rush someone or to rush someone to the hospital means to take someone or to go with someone very, very quickly.

134
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:04,860
Okay.

135
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,960
So let's give an example.

136
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,980
I could say, listen, Marco, I don't want to rush you, but I really need the report done today.

137
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:14,720
Or I could say, I need to rush home.

138
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,820
My parents need me.

139
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:20,299
Or if a woman is having a baby, you want to rush her to the emergency room.

140
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,360
Okay.

141
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,799
So you need to go quickly.

142
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:23,960
All right.

143
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:31,559
Now, when we were talking about fainting, the person said, before he used the word faint, he said, I tend to faint.

144
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:32,840
Okay.

145
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,019
I tend to.

146
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:40,379
I tend to is a really great verb that describes a normal or habitual behavior.

147
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,159
That's like saying, I tend to faint when it's very, very hot outside.

148
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,019
That means I often faint when it's very, very hot outside.

149
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,659
It's something that happens normally.

150
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,779
So it's a tendency.

151
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,220
Right.

152
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,279
But it's not for everyone.

153
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,120
It's for me.

154
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,460
So I tend to.

155
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,460
What's something that you tend to faint when you see?

156
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,639
I never faint.

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,220
You don't faint?

158
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,539
Not a man.

159
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:03,799
No.

160
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,299
Just kidding.

161
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:05,580
But you know what?

162
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,580
I tend to leave the towel on the bed sometimes after I take a shower.

163
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:10,500
I know.

164
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:11,240
It's a bad habit.

165
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,159
And then the sheets smell.

166
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,100
No, they don't.

167
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,899
Because I leave it there for like five or 10 minutes and then I realize I'm like, oh my God.

168
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:18,139
And then I pick it up.

169
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,279
But you know, it's hard.

170
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:20,759
That's gross.

171
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:21,940
No, it's not.

172
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:28,360
Well, I tend to forget my leftover food in the refrigerator for a long time.

173
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,960
And then it starts to smell.

174
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:30,740
That's gross.

175
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,299
But I don't like to waste food.

176
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,559
But you like let it rot and then your fridge smells.

177
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,240
It happens.

178
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,360
So that's all we've got for Fluency Builder today.

179
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,080
But we can talk about tendencies in a moment.

180
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,759
Maybe a homework assignment could be to think of something that you tend to do.

181
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,299
That's right.

182
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,100
That could be an interesting homework assignment.

183
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:52,299
But before we jump into that, why don't we listen to our dialogue for the very last time?

184
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,039
Hey, Joe, where have you been these past few days?

185
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,179
I've been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross.

186
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:06,960
Cool.

187
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:09,279
I've always wanted to do something like that.

188
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,679
Have you learned anything useful?

189
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:11,539
For sure.

190
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:17,860
I mean, we learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding, how to check for a pulse and even how to apply CPR.

191
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,980
Have you treated any real emergencies?

192
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,299
Well, they took us along with some paramedics.

193
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,840
There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures.

194
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:31,120
His wounds were pretty serious, so they had to rush him to the hospital.

195
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,139
It was intense.

196
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,320
I can imagine.

197
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,240
I tend to faint when I see blood, so I think I won't be taking up a course like that anytime soon.

198
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,980
All right, we're back.

199
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,820
So that's all the time we have for today.

200
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,720
Be sure to do your homework assignment.

201
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,539
Come to EnglishPod.com.

202
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:56,980
In the comments section, tell us, what do you tend to do?

203
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:57,879
It could be a good thing.

204
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,779
It could be a bad thing.

205
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:08,399
Obviously, you can try and use some of the vocabulary you heard in today's lesson about health and safety, and you might get some extra points from us for doing that.

206
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:15,000
I know some people who tend to leave the house with a whole medicine kit in their bags or in their purses.

207
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,360
Really?

208
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,700
We could say a first aid kit.

209
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,960
A first aid kit, exactly.

210
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:18,419
Wow.

211
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,320
So do you do this?

212
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:19,899
Let us know.

213
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,559
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

214
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,899
That's all we've got for today, so until next time.

215
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,379
Bye.

216
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,779
Bye, guys.

217
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:29,379
Bye.
