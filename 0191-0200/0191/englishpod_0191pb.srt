00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,299
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:11,660
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about something that has always been very confusing for me.

4
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:13,060
For me as well.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,699
I don't understand very well what this is about.

6
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:21,019
We're going to be talking about time zones and a little bit about daylight savings time.

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,679
Before we get started, though, let's take a look at this phrase in today's vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,020
Vocabulary Preview Alright, so the phrase is daylight savings time.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,479
Okay, so we're trying to save daylight, pretty much.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,119
That's right.

11
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,359
So, this is the time of year when we change our clocks.

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,280
What does that mean?

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:48,460
That means in the fall, there's a special day, and everyone has it on their calendar, and we change the clocks, we put them back one hour.

14
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:51,020
So if it was 8 o'clock, now it's 7 o'clock.

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,899
Okay, so everything is earlier, starts earlier.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,579
Yes.

17
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:57,219
And that's basically to take advantage of the daylight, right?

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,039
That's why it's called daylight savings time.

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:07,200
Exactly, and so that's for the winter, and then when the winter is past, we change the clocks again, we have the spring daylight savings, where we change our clocks ahead.

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,099
Okay, so it sounds kind of complicated.

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,560
Many countries don't have daylight savings time, they don't change their clocks at all.

22
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,799
But we're going to be talking about this in a little bit more, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time.

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,239
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?

24
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:28,900
What?

25
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,519
Why do we have to do that?

26
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,620
Well, at the start of the spring, we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon.

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,400
This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the Earth.

28
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:45,079
In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.

29
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,980
I see, that's convenient.

30
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,040
I never understood things like this, such as GMT.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,920
I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock.

32
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,420
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time.

33
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,180
Here in California, we're in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich.

34
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,900
Remember when we were in Beijing?

35
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:07,319
Well then we were in China Standard Time, and that's eight time zones east of Greenwich.

36
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,080
That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA, because of the huge time difference.

37
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:20,419
Even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived in LA the same day at noon.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,560
It's like we went back in time!

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,539
Alright, we're back.

40
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:36,780
So that was a pretty clear explanation of why we do these things, but maybe there are a couple of words that you didn't understand, so let's take a look at those now in Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:52,319
Well, Marco, what you were hinting at before, this idea that we have shorter days in the with the rotation of the Earth, and so the rotation of the Earth is our first phrase.

42
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,060
Okay, so the Earth rotates.

43
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,539
What does that mean if it rotates?

44
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,979
It means to spin around, but not just to spin around anywhere.

45
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,780
It means that if you draw a line through the middle of something, it never leaves that line, it just kind of turns.

46
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,800
Okay, so it's spinning.

47
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:16,020
Like the wheels on a car, they rotate, that means they go around, but they are fixed to the car.

48
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:16,520
To the car.

49
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:16,960
Right.

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,400
So this is one of the reasons why we need to compensate our clocks, because of the rotation of the Earth.

51
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,979
And that's our next word, to compensate.

52
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:33,300
This is a verb, to compensate, and it's often used with money, but it can be used with time as well, time or sunlight.

53
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:40,800
So with money you'd say, I paid him $100, but I owed him $150, so I'm going to compensate him for the extra $50.

54
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,360
Okay.

55
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,740
Means I'm going to fix it.

56
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,939
Okay, so to compensate would be the verb, and compensation would be the noun.

57
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:52,259
Now in this case we're talking about time, so how can we compensate time?

58
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:58,360
Well, that means that if we have lost an hour because we changed the clocks, we have to compensate.

59
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,240
We have to try and gain that hour back.

60
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:08,080
And so that's why in the spring, after the days start to get longer and longer, we have to compensate for that by changing the clocks again.

61
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:08,659
Okay.

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,599
So we're compensating time.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,279
Now related to daylight savings and this whole time thing is time zones.

64
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:26,879
We have time zones all over the earth, and you've probably noticed this, if you've traveled you have to change your clocks, or many times you see in hotels what time it is in London, in Hong Kong, in Berlin, et cetera.

65
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:39,040
And this makes a lot of sense, because like we said, the earth is rotating, and so if it's daylight in Moscow and it's nighttime in New York, obviously it's not the same time.

66
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,500
Right.

67
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,220
And so to compensate for this difference, we have different time zones.

68
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,939
And each time zone is pretty much an hour or so, you know, half an hour, different from the next one.

69
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:49,360
Right.

70
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:59,519
So most countries actually have different time zones throughout their country, unless they're small, that they don't really need to compensate any change, or for example China, just to unify everything.

71
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,680
It's a big country, but they have one time zone.

72
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,879
China standard time.

73
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:03,519
Exactly.

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
But in the United States, we have four time zones.

75
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,180
All right.

76
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,199
So that's time zone, and now related to time zone is time difference.

77
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:13,220
Okay.

78
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,660
Well, think about math here.

79
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,439
Difference is a word that we use in math.

80
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:25,000
And a time difference is the amount of time, that means how many hours there are between one time zone and another time zone.

81
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,899
So for example, Beijing and New York City.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,100
These are very, very far away from each other.

83
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,519
If it's day in New York, it's night in Beijing.

84
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:41,379
So that means if it's seven in the morning in Beijing, it's probably around seven at night in New York.

85
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,379
So the time difference would be more or less 12 hours.

86
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,800
But when it's daylight savings time, it's 13.

87
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:48,639
So be careful.

88
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:49,879
Right.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,300
Okay.

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,720
I think that's pretty clear.

91
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,560
I think we should go back and listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

92
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:56,759
Perfect.

93
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,839
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?

94
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:04,459
What?

95
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,120
Why do we have to do that?

96
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,199
Well, at the start of the spring, we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon.

97
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,980
This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the Earth.

98
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,639
In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.

99
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,480
I see.

100
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,540
That's convenient.

101
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,620
I never understood things like this, such as GMT.

102
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,519
I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock.

103
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,980
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time.

104
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,759
Here in California, we're in Pacific Standard Time.

105
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,759
That is eight time zones west of Greenwich.

106
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:38,480
Remember when we were in Beijing?

107
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,899
Well, then we were in China Standard Time, and that's eight time zones east of Greenwich.

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,660
That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA, because of the huge time difference.

109
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,980
Even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived in LA the same day at noon.

110
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,180
It's like we went back in time.

111
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,779
All right, we're back.

112
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,060
So now let's take a look at three key phrases in Fluency Builder.

113
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,540
Let's go back to the beginning of this dialogue.

114
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:22,240
The person who's explaining all of these interesting things is saying that, well, in any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.

115
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,120
So this is an important phrase you could say to take better advantage of or to take advantage of.

116
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,399
Let's talk about this.

117
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:29,839
To take advantage of something.

118
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,779
So to take advantage of something is to use it efficiently, right?

119
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,699
Or to take better advantage.

120
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:48,500
So for example, if you drive to work every day and your neighbor drives to work every day and you work at the same place, you could take better advantage of your car and the cost by sharing the same car to work.

121
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:49,920
Exactly.

122
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:59,800
Or when people started to use computers, you could say, well, they were taking better advantage of their time by speeding things up, by making things faster with the computers.

123
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:06,019
Or many mothers say, take better advantage of your time and read something instead of playing those video games.

124
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:06,740
Exactly.

125
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,540
So it means, like you said, to be more efficient, to do useful or important things.

126
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,300
That's right.

127
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:22,759
And now when we talked about what Daylight Savings Time means or GMT, what that stands for, this is an interesting phrase, it stands for.

128
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,480
Well, think about it as a picture.

129
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:31,040
So if something stands for something else, that means the original thing, it's not there anymore.

130
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:40,980
And so in words and phrases like GMT, GMT doesn't mean anything by itself, but the G stands for something.

131
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:41,820
The M stands for something.

132
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,720
It's an acronym.

133
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:50,600
So this is an acronym that stands for, that represents three big long words, Greenwich Mean Time.

134
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,080
Right.

135
00:08:51,659 --> 00:09:04,580
So we use this a lot when we are defining words or when we are defining an acronym like GMT stands for Greenwich Mean Time or, for example, USA stands for United States of America.

136
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,899
Or we can even say someone's name stands for something.

137
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,440
So Marco, what is the M in your last name stand for?

138
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,419
So you're Marco M.

139
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,259
What does the M stand for?

140
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,419
And then I would say, well, it stands for Mejia.

141
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,220
Your last name.

142
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:25,279
So you can use this when you see things that you don't understand, maybe an acronym or an abbreviation, like does Kathy stand for Catherine?

143
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,820
Yes, Kathy stands for Catherine.

144
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,279
It's a short version of Catherine.

145
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:28,720
Cool.

146
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,340
All right.

147
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:35,659
And well, now talking a little bit more about time, you've maybe seen the movie Back to the Future.

148
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,659
And this is what it's all about, to go back in time.

149
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,440
To go back in time.

150
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,139
So we went back in time.

151
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:45,700
This is what the person says about the flight from Beijing to LA.

152
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,600
What's interesting is that to go back in time is kind of a fixed phrase.

153
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,600
We always say it like this.

154
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,720
So we could say, if you went back in time, where would you go?

155
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,379
What time?

156
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,179
What place?

157
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:56,759
Right.

158
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,379
So to go back in time.

159
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,379
You usually use it like this.

160
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,600
Now, what if I wanted to say to go into the future?

161
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,700
Could you say go forward in time?

162
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,799
You could go forward in time or you could go into the future.

163
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:07,440
Right.

164
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:08,480
Go into the future.

165
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,720
So remember, if you want to talk about going back in time, it's usually traveling to the past.

166
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,659
Exactly.

167
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:15,659
All right.

168
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,379
So that's all the phrases we have.

169
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,159
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the very last time?

170
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:29,639
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?

171
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,299
What?

172
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,940
Why do we have to do that?

173
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,019
Well, at the start of the spring, we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon.

174
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,820
This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the Earth.

175
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,500
In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.

176
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,320
I see.

177
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,379
That's convenient.

178
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,419
I never understood things like this, such as GMT.

179
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,299
I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock.

180
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,799
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time.

181
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,600
Here in California, we're in Pacific Standard Time.

182
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,620
That is eight time zones west of Greenwich.

183
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,299
Remember when we were in Beijing?

184
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:08,700
Well, then we were in China Standard Time, and that's eight time zones east of Greenwich.

185
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,480
That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA, because of the huge time difference.

186
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:21,840
Even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived in LA the same day at noon.

187
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,039
It's like we went back in time.

188
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:33,440
All right, we're back, and now this is actually something that really does happen, right?

189
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:41,059
If you take off in an airplane from Beijing, you fly for a certain amount of hours, and you reach California, and it's still the same time.

190
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:42,740
You reach it in the same day.

191
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,100
It's very strange.

192
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,919
The same thing happens to me when I go home.

193
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:53,039
So I leave Shanghai, and I arrive in Chicago, and I arrive at the exact same time I left on the same day.

194
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,179
So it's like if time never passed.

195
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:59,500
It's the longest day of your entire life, because it's not 24 hours.

196
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,779
The flight is 14 hours.

197
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,700
It's really 24, 38 hours long, right?

198
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,539
So it's really intense and exhausting.

199
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,940
And then what happens is when you do the opposite.

200
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:15,460
You go from Chicago to Shanghai, then you go into the future pretty much, right?

201
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,259
Because you left on a Sunday, but you arrive on a Tuesday.

202
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,840
Or in my case, yeah, you leave on a Sunday, and you'd arrive on a Monday, and you lose half a day of your life.

203
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,039
You're just sitting there, and all of a sudden, it goes past you.

204
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,700
Yeah, so it all evens out in the end.

205
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,320
Right, right.

206
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,480
So when you go back or when you come, it all evens out.

207
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,700
You recover.

208
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,620
You get those hours of your life back, pretty much.

209
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,539
They're not gone forever.

210
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:51,860

Bye.

216

Bye.
