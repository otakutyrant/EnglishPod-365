00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:08,259
EnglishPod.com Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:08,919
What?

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:10,560
Why do we have to do that?

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:15,660
Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon.

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,440
This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the Earth.

6
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:25,100
In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:25,920
I see.

8
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:27,000
That's convenient.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,039
I never understood things like this, such as GMT.

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,939
I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock.

11
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,439
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time.

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,219
Here in California, we're in Pacific Standard Time.

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,219
That is eight time zones west of Greenwich.

14
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:42,920
Remember when we were in Beijing?

15
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,340
Well, then we were in China Standard Time, and that's eight time zones east of Greenwich.

16
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,299
That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA.

17
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,119
Because of the huge time difference.

18
00:00:53,119 --> 00:01:00,439
Even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived in LA the same day at noon.

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,619
It's like we went back in time!
