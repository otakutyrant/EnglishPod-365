00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Oh man, I had the best supper last night.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I love stir-fry.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Crispy bite-sized vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Mmm.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Mmm.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's almost lunch time.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I would die for a plate of stir-fry right now.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, you can keep the vegetables.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll take the meat.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The stir-fry my wife made was really hearty.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
With chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You call that a stir-fry?

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
More meat than vegetables?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir-fry.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap.
