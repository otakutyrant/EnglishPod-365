00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:09,720
EnglishPod.com Oh man, I had the best supper last night.

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,699
My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,800
I love stir-fry.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,519
Crispy bite-sized vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,039
Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,920
Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,579
Mmm.

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,300
Mmm.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,460
It's almost lunch time.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,239
I would die for a plate of stir-fry right now.

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,300
Well, you can keep the vegetables.

12
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,359
I'll take the meat.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,179
The stir-fry my wife made was really hearty.

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,640
With chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion.

15
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:39,100
What?

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,979
You call that a stir-fry?

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,520
More meat than vegetables?

18
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,179
That's the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir-fry.

19
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:49,219
What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in.

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,479
What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap.
