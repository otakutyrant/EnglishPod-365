00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about one of our favorite subjects, food.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right and on this occasion we are going to talk about Chinese food, specifically stir-fry.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, this is a common dish in America and all over the world thanks to the many Cantonese people who came over from Hong Kong or southern China and brought these delicious foods to our cities.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So, this is a very popular dish you'll be learning more about.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, let's jump right in and listen to today's dialogue and don't be worried if you don't understand everything.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We'll be back in a moment.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh man, I had the best supper last night.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I love stir-fry.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Crispy bite-sized vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's almost lunch time.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I would die for a plate of stir-fry right now.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, you can keep the vegetables.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'll take the meat.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The stir-fry my wife made was really hearty with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What?

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You call that a stir-fry?

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
More meat than vegetables?

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir-fry.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
All right, we're back.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, you probably heard a lot of different vegetables and ingredients in this dish.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So, why don't we take a look at some of those now in Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The first two phrases that we have, actually, they're not words, they're phrases, are the names of sauces that are very, very important to Chinese food.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The first one is soy sauce.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, soy sauce.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And it's this black sauce, right?

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Very salty.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Very salty.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And it's made from?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Soybeans.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Soybeans, okay.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Soy.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, soy is a bean, a vegetable product, but soy sauce is a thin, black, salty sauce.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, and it's very, very common to use it with Chinese dishes, especially.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's very related.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You usually have sushi with soy sauce.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Exactly.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So, Japanese food use a lot of this too.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
All right, and the other sauce that's not very common in our countries is oyster sauce.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, an oyster is an animal that lives in the sea.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It lives in a fish, but oyster sauce is stinky, thick, dark sauce that is very popular in Southeast Asian, so Vietnamese food as well, and Chinese food.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, so it's part of the ingredients of Chinese food.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's really good.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It smells terrible.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's stinky.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But when you mix it with food and you cook it, it adds a very, very good flavor.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Absolutely.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
All right, so that's the sauces.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Now, apart from sauces, we have some vegetables, and some of those are bean sprouts.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Bean sprouts are very common vegetables, especially in Asian food, so you see a lot of these.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They're usually almost white, almost clear, and they're crunchy, and they have a little green part at the end.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Right, so they're like little straws with a little green point at the end.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So, usually those go into your fish at the very end because they cook quickly.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Bean sprouts.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay, now if you're cooking stir-fry, what you need is the correct tools, and the main tool that you need is a wok.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's right.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So, a wok is actually a word that we take from, I think, Cantonese.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm not positive I don't speak Cantonese, but in English we normally say frying pan.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But this is a special Asian frying pan that's very, very large and very thin, so foods cook quickly in a wok.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay, and it's not like the other pans where it has a big flat part.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's very, very round all over.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's right.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's almost like a bowl that sits on your stove, and you cook quickly in a wok.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
All right, so that's a wok.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And, well, the guy compared his stir-fry to a fajita.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Now, fajita, that's not Chinese.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And it's not English.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, it is English.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now, it's actually the name of a food from Latin America.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So, South America and Mexico and Central America.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think more Mexican than anything.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And it's like slivers of meat, so thin strips of meat and vegetables that you eat in a tortilla bread, almost.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
A tortilla is a very thin corn or flour pancake.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah, so that's a fajita.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's kind of, you've probably seen it, a fajita or maybe what's commonly known as well as a burrito, which actually is also an American invention.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't think that exists in Mexico.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No, but they are delicious.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I think the word is Tex-Mex, Texas-Mexican, so Tex-Mex.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
All right, so that's what we have for you on Language Takeaway.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why don't we go back to our dialogue, listen to it again and we'll be back shortly.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh man, I had the best supper last night.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I love stir-fry.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Crispy bite-sized vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's almost lunchtime.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I would die for a plate of stir-fry right now.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, you can keep the vegetables.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll take the meat.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The stir-fry my wife made was really hearty, with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What?

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You call that a stir-fry?

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
More meat than vegetables?

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir-fry.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
All right, we're back.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So now I think we should take a look at some of those phrases that were used in this dialogue in Fluency Builder.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Fluency Builder.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The first phrase we have in Fluency Builder is a phrase that you will hear very often when you watch cooking shows.

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So this is a term we say throw in, to throw in.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, so throw in some vegetables or throw in some onion and garlic, and that means to just put it into the pan, put it into the pot.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's right, but it's very general or casual or easy.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You just add some.

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If you want to be specific, we can say, please add one cup chopped onion, okay?

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
One cup of chopped onion.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But here, throw in just means add casually.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay, add some onion.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So we throw in all these ingredients, and it sounds so delicious that the guy says, I would die for a plate of stir fry right about now.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So that means he wants some stir fry.

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I would die for is a good thing.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a way to say I really want some.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's an exaggeration.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's not like you would actually die for it or you are dying to eat it.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's just that it's an exaggeration means that you really, really want it.

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I would die for a new car.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
My car is old and it never really works.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
All right, so you really want a new car.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay, and well, the guy obviously didn't really like what he was talking about and how he cooked this stir fry and he said, what a disgrace to the wok she fried it in.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, this is a way to say that something is bad.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's embarrassing.

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So we can say that this food is a disgrace to Chinese food because Chinese food is one way, but this doesn't even look like Chinese food.

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So a disgrace, a disgrace.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So the word disgrace, it means that something is bad.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Or embarrassing to something else.

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So a parent can say you're a disgrace to this family.

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That means this family has a good reputation, but what you did, what you do, these are bad things.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
They make us look bad.

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They're embarrassing.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They're disgraced.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Very good.

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
A strong phrase and you can use it if you ever want to talk about someone or something in this way.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But remember, it is pretty strong, right?

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If you say somebody's a disgrace, it's pretty insulting.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's hurtful.

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for one last time and we'll be back.

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh man, I had the best supper last night.

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
My wife made a stir fry and it was amazing.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I love stir fry.

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Crispy bite-sized vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger.

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's almost lunch time.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I would die for a plate of stir fry right now.

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Well, you can keep the vegetables.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll take the meat.

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The stir fry my wife made was really hearty with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion.

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What?

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You call that a stir fry?

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
More meat than vegetables?

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,000
All right, so talking about Chinese food, there are a lot of American inventions around Chinese food as well, not only Mexican food.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
For example, it's very popular this dish chop suey.

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's right, chopped suey and I think I read somewhere that chop suey is actually, might have been a Cantonese dish that came from all of the leftovers and kind of garbage in the kitchen where you would just fry it together and it was a cheap easy meal.

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So chop suey, it's kind of like an English, it's like a pigeon English.

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And well, this dish is basically that, right?

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's just a lot of meat chunks mixed with some vegetables and you have some chop suey.

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Exactly.

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And there are also this other thing that's very common.

171
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
People think about fortune cookies.

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You think of Chinese restaurants and Chinese food, you think of fortune cookies.

173
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's right, but they don't have fortune cookies in China.

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
One of my biggest disappointments.

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So fortune cookie is a small cookie with a message inside.

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So you have a piece of paper.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So be careful when you're eating these, you don't want to eat the paper.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But the paper sometimes says very strange things like you will have a terrific number seven.

179
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Right, or something like that.

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So that's why they're fortune cookies.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They usually talk about your future or what's going to happen.

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Beware of whales.

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So, but that's also an American invention that doesn't exist in China.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It doesn't really come from China, right?

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Exactly.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
All right.
