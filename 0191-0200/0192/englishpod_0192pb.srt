00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name is Kathryn, and today we have a very weather-focused lesson.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's all about all the horrible things that can happen to you with the weather.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Exactly.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So as you know, there are many different types of weather, and not only rain or sunshine, but many other phenomena.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So we're going to take a look at some of those, but before we go into it, let's take a look at one word on Vocabulary Preview.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Vocabulary Preview Okay, so we're talking about extreme weather today.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's not rain or drizzle or sunshine.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We're talking about really interesting, unique, and sometimes devastating things that can happen.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So today's vocabulary word is Armageddon.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
All right, so Armageddon.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now you've probably seen the movie Armageddon, so what does this word mean?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, so this word is a reference to the end of the world.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It means the time when the world will end because of a great catastrophe or a great disaster.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay, so everyone talks about Armageddon.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's mentioned in the Bible, and as you say, it's when the world stops existing.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Exactly.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So think about that one as we listen to today's dialogue.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We will be back in a minute to talk about what's going on.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Those are the headlines for today, and now for the International Weather Report with Mike Sanderson.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Thank you, Bob.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many, as a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
In Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported in the Alps.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Fortunately, no one was injured.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Due to the extreme cold this winter, a blizzard has struck the U.S.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Midwest, causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Moving on to Latin America, Ecuador has suffered a six-month drought that has not only affected farming, but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In Chile, a major earthquake that registered 7.5 on the Richter scale struck the southern region.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Losses are reported to be in the billions.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Authorities have not yet released an official statement.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Not a great week for the world.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Any good news?

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm afraid not, Bob.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the region.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Meanwhile, Mexico's coast has been hit by Hurricane Liliana, and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami made hit Central America, affecting Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's all the news we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on the 6 o'clock news.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Back to you, Bob.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
All right, we're back, and well, this weather report is not really far from the truth.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I mean, this kind of stuff happens every day all over the world, right?

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's correct.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And unfortunately, it's been happening very frequently in the past couple months.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We've heard of a lot of earthquakes and volcanoes and things like that.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So this is very valuable stuff when you're trying to talk about current events as well.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
OK.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So why don't we start now analyzing a couple of different words and phrases on language takeaway.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Language takeaway.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, the first vocabulary item we have here is meteorological event.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's a real mouthful.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a long word.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Meteorological.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So, for example, meteorological means having to do with the weather, something that's related to the weather.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So a meteorological event could be rain, snow.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
OK.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So it has to do with meteorology.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Meteorology is the study of the weather, and someone who does this is a meteorologist.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So usually the weathermen that you see on TV, they're meteorologists.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So let's go now to Marco, our resident meteorologist.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There we go.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Our resident meteorologist.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Right.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
OK.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So meteorological events.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now moving on, one of the first events that we're going to look at is an avalanche.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Avalanche.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
An avalanche has to do with snow.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This means that when a mountain that has a lot of snow on it, maybe part of that snow breaks off and starts to roll down, you have a wall of snow that comes down.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's an avalanche.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's an avalanche.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So you could say, avalanche, when the snow comes down.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And it's actually very dangerous because people can get buried under the snow.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, exactly.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
All right.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So another event that has to do with snow is a blizzard.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
OK.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A blizzard is different from an avalanche because an avalanche, maybe it's not snowing.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The snow just falls.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But in a blizzard, you're talking about a storm of snow.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But it's like a lot of snow coming down from the sky.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So much snow that you probably can't see anything.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There's just white everywhere.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
OK.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
All right.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So that's a blizzard.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
A lot of, lot of snow coming down from the sky.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Now moving on, the opposite of snow and things being wet is we have a drought.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, this is the opposite of wet, actually.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So there's no rain in a drought.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A drought means that things are very dry.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The land is very dry.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
OK.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So it's a period of time that there's no snow.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There's no water.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There's no rain.

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There's nothing.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's very, very dry.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We're going through a drought.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Correct.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And the problem with a drought is very dangerous is because people cannot grow food in a drought.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And so lots of people starve when this happens.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So you've got to watch out for a drought.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now in this case, it not only affected farming, but also we have a hydroelectric power plant that can't work, obviously, because there's no water.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So hydro means water.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hydroelectric means electricity that is generated by flowing water.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And so, for example, a mill, something that turns water on a river is a way to get power from water.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But a hydroelectric project that can give you electricity is maybe like a dam or an electric mill.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So usually you have these in rivers, and they just take advantage of the flowing of water to turn some huge turbines and generate power.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So that's all we have for now.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back shortly to take a look at some more words.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Not a great week for the world.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Any good news?

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm afraid not, Bob.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the region.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Meanwhile, Mexico's coast has been hit by Hurricane Liliana, and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami made hit Central America, affecting Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama.

115
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's all the news we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on the 6 o'clock news.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Back to you, Bob.

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, a word that many people are unfortunately familiar with is Richter or Richter scale.

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And now this is something that a lot of people are talking about right now because of the earthquake in Sichuan, China last year and the earthquake in Haiti very recently.

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And so the Richter scale, that's a big R because it's a proper name, is a way for us to determine how severe, how big the earthquake was.

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So people talk about a 6.0, a 7.1.

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So that's on the Richter scale.

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The lowest is zero and the highest is 10, correct?

123
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Right.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But 10 is like impossible, apparently.

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Apparently.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And a lot of them are actually underwater, but the very serious ones are maybe 8.0, 7.0.

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
All right.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So Richter scale.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Now we talked about earthquakes, we talk about snowing.

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Now let's talk about a volcano.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
A volcano in Mexico has erupted.

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay.

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So we've got two words here, volcano.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
A volcano is a mountain that has an opening in the center where lava from the middle of the earth, the center of the earth, can come out.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So it's very dangerous, obviously, because it's very hot.

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But a volcano doesn't open, it erupts.

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So the verb here that we use with a volcano is to erupt.

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, so it doesn't explode, a volcano erupts.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That means to open violently very quickly.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay.

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So when this happens, obviously you have a lot of lava, you have maybe snow that melts, and you have floods and landslides.

142
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay, landslides.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
A landslide is one word, but it's made up of two words that you probably already know.

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So land, obviously it's the ground and things like that, the earth.

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But a slide is to move down across the ground.

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And so a landslide happens when you've got something like lava or water that's pushing all of the earth, all of the ground down, and it's destroying houses and trees and land, and it's very, very destructive.

147
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So you usually see this that happens on the side of mountains or on the side of hills where all that land starts to slide down or to go down.

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And it's very similar to an avalanche, right?

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But instead of snow falling down, it's a land.

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mud and land.

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mud, yeah.

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
All right, so we have a landslide.

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And because of all the eruptions and the earthquakes, they said that they have a lot of seismic activity.

154
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This word seismic is something that I've heard a lot recently in movies, like 2012.

155
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So seismic means having to do with the movement of the plates under the earth's crust.

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So, you know, the earth is not everything that we see.

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's also activity, things happening underneath the ground.

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And so underneath the ground, we have these big plates.

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And seismic activity is what happens when these kind of things start to move.

160
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Activity is movement.

161
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And so seismic activity refers to earthquakes and volcanoes, things that are changing under the ground that will affect us.

162
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay.

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So that's seismic activity.

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's pronounced seismic, right?

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Seismic.

166
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Seismic.

167
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's correct.

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay.

169
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And because of all this activity, people say that they may have a tsunami.

170
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, this doesn't sound very English, does it?

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I know, tsunami.

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And actually, if you see the spelling, it's with a T.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,000
T-S.

174
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Right.

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I think it's a Japanese word, but I'm not positive.

176
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think so, too.

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Tsunami is the name that we give to a giant tidal wave.

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So that's a wave of water in the ocean that's very, very dangerous because it can get to 100, 200 feet tall.

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And this means that when it comes down, it can destroy houses, cities, cars, things like that.

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And there was a very, very famous tsunami in Southeast Asia in 2004.

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Do you remember that?

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And in Indonesia, right?

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's right.

184
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
In Indonesia and Thailand and Vietnam.

185
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah.

186
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It was intense.

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It was big.

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And it was also because of an earthquake, right?

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I think so.

190
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
All these earthquakes, they move the earth around and then all of a sudden the reaction is that there's water that moves and the water then turns into a wave.

191
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Just imagine what happens if you have a bucket of water and then you start moving the bucket just a little bit and you see how water starts to splat all over the place.

192
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's right.

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,000
All right.

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So tsunami was our last word for today.

195
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back shortly.

196
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Those are the headlines for today and now for the International Weather Report with Mike Sanderson.

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Thank you, Bob.

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many as a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world.

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
In Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported in the Alps.

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Fortunately, no one was injured.

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Due to the extreme cold this winter, a blizzard has struck the U.S.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Midwest, causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled.

203
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Moving on to Latin America, Ecuador has suffered a six-month drought that has not only affected farming but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country.

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
In Chile, a major earthquake that registered 7.5 on the Richter scale struck the southern region.

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Losses are reported to be in the billions.

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Authorities have not yet released an official statement.

207
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Not a great week for the world.

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Any good news?

209
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm afraid not, Bob.

210
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the region.

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Meanwhile, Mexico's coast has been hit by Hurricane Liliana, and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami made hit Central America, affecting Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama.

212
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's all the news we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on the 6 o'clock news.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Back to you, Bob.

214
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So Marco, these are all pretty terrifying.

215
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Have you ever experienced a meteorological event like one of the ones that we talked about today?

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I've actually lived through like three earthquakes.

217
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Like pretty big ones.

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Well, that's because you used to live in Los Angeles.

219
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So that way you get them all the time in LA.

220
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Apart from that, I've seen a volcano erupt a couple of times, because Ecuador is part of the volcano alley, right?

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's all the Andes Mountains, and it's part of the circle of fire, what they call it.

222
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So we have a couple of different active volcanoes, and from time to time they will start to smoke or spew some lava, but nothing major.

223
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
There hasn't been a major catastrophe with the volcanoes.

224
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Hopefully it won't either.

225
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Well, and these days they have a lot of equipment, seismic equipment and meteorological equipment, that can help meteorologists to determine when things will happen, like when a volcano will erupt or if there will be an earthquake, because they can study the tremors in the ground.

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah, and I think probably the most famous volcano is, I think it was in Italy, right?

227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Mount Vesuvius.

228
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's right.

229
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So you've got Mount Vesuvius in Naples, which famously destroyed a number of cities in this ancient civilization, in ancient Roman times.

230
00:15:46,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It was, and what's amazing is that they still have a lot of the buildings under the ash, because when all the ash settled it preserved the bodies like a mummy, and so you can see the bodies and the things that they, you know, their jewelry and their money, and it's fascinating because it's this horrible, horrible natural disaster, actually helped us in the future learn about this old civilization.

231
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah, it's crazy, actually in Ecuador you can see a huge hole that has like a lake in the middle, and you're like, oh wow, that's beautiful, but that's actually caused because the entire mountain just kind of blew the top off, like the cone, because of this major eruption, so you can just imagine how powerful these eruptions are.

232
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can just imagine what it would have been like, Mount Vesuvius.

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But anyway, on a brighter note, if you have any questions, any comments, or any stories of your own, maybe you've lived through a typhoon, a hurricane, a tornado, you can come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

234
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,000
We hope to see you there.

235
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000
All right.

236
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Bye guys.
