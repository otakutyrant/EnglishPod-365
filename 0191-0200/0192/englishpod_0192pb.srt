00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,860
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:06,540
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,640
My name is Kathryn, and today we have a very weather-focused lesson.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,660
It's all about all the horrible things that can happen to you with the weather.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:17,679
Exactly.

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:25,120
So as you know, there are many different types of weather, and not only rain or sunshine, but many other phenomena.

7
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:31,460
So we're going to take a look at some of those, but before we go into it, let's take a look at one word on Vocabulary Preview.

8
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,859
Vocabulary Preview Okay, so we're talking about extreme weather today.

9
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,320
That's not rain or drizzle or sunshine.

10
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:47,079
We're talking about really interesting, unique, and sometimes devastating things that can happen.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,079
So today's vocabulary word is Armageddon.

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,939
All right, so Armageddon.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,539
Now you've probably seen the movie Armageddon, so what does this word mean?

14
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,240
Okay, so this word is a reference to the end of the world.

15
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:10,060
It means the time when the world will end because of a great catastrophe or a great disaster.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,099
Okay, so everyone talks about Armageddon.

17
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,640
It's mentioned in the Bible, and as you say, it's when the world stops existing.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,200
Exactly.

19
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:21,980
So think about that one as we listen to today's dialogue.

20
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,400
We will be back in a minute to talk about what's going on.

21
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,819
Those are the headlines for today, and now for the International Weather Report with Mike Sanderson.

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,260
Thank you, Bob.

23
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:49,739
This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many, as a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world.

24
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,519
In Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported in the Alps.

25
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,560
Fortunately, no one was injured.

26
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,459
Due to the extreme cold this winter, a blizzard has struck the U.S.

27
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,739
Midwest, causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled.

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:15,240
Moving on to Latin America, Ecuador has suffered a six-month drought that has not only affected farming, but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country.

29
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,680
In Chile, a major earthquake that registered 7.5 on the Richter scale struck the southern region.

30
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,000
Losses are reported to be in the billions.

31
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,520
Authorities have not yet released an official statement.

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,960
Not a great week for the world.

33
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,020
Any good news?

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,800
I'm afraid not, Bob.

35
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,219
One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the region.

36
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:48,840
Meanwhile, Mexico's coast has been hit by Hurricane Liliana, and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami made hit Central America, affecting Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama.

37
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,000
That's all the news we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on the 6 o'clock news.

38
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,180
Back to you, Bob.

39
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,439
All right, we're back, and well, this weather report is not really far from the truth.

40
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,939
I mean, this kind of stuff happens every day all over the world, right?

41
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:11,659
That's correct.

42
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:15,800
And unfortunately, it's been happening very frequently in the past couple months.

43
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:20,219
We've heard of a lot of earthquakes and volcanoes and things like that.

44
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,800
So this is very valuable stuff when you're trying to talk about current events as well.

45
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,219
OK.

46
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:32,060
So why don't we start now analyzing a couple of different words and phrases on language takeaway.

47
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,240
Language takeaway.

48
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:41,979
Well, the first vocabulary item we have here is meteorological event.

49
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:43,360
It's a real mouthful.

50
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,199
It's a long word.

51
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,300
Meteorological.

52
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:53,039
So, for example, meteorological means having to do with the weather, something that's related to the weather.

53
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:58,979
So a meteorological event could be rain, snow.

54
00:03:59,680 --> 00:03:59,979
OK.

55
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,460
So it has to do with meteorology.

56
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,860
Meteorology is the study of the weather, and someone who does this is a meteorologist.

57
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,259
So usually the weathermen that you see on TV, they're meteorologists.

58
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,819
So let's go now to Marco, our resident meteorologist.

59
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:16,500
There we go.

60
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:18,220
Our resident meteorologist.

61
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:18,779
Right.

62
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:19,300
OK.

63
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:21,720
So meteorological events.

64
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Now moving on, one of the first events that we're going to look at is an avalanche.

65
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:27,860
Avalanche.

66
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
An avalanche has to do with snow.

67
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:44,120
This means that when a mountain that has a lot of snow on it, maybe part of that snow breaks off and starts to roll down, you have a wall of snow that comes down.

68
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,959
That's an avalanche.

69
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,199
That's an avalanche.

70
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,160
So you could say, avalanche, when the snow comes down.

71
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,240
And it's actually very dangerous because people can get buried under the snow.

72
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,279
Yeah, exactly.

73
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,240
All right.

74
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,480
So another event that has to do with snow is a blizzard.

75
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:02,519
OK.

76
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,839
A blizzard is different from an avalanche because an avalanche, maybe it's not snowing.

77
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,899
The snow just falls.

78
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,980
But in a blizzard, you're talking about a storm of snow.

79
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,839
But it's like a lot of snow coming down from the sky.

80
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,379
So much snow that you probably can't see anything.

81
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,300
There's just white everywhere.

82
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,000
OK.

83
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,220
All right.

84
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,279
So that's a blizzard.

85
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,860
A lot of, lot of snow coming down from the sky.

86
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,800
Now moving on, the opposite of snow and things being wet is we have a drought.

87
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,100
Yeah, this is the opposite of wet, actually.

88
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,439
So there's no rain in a drought.

89
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:41,740
A drought means that things are very dry.

90
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,399
The land is very dry.

91
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,279
OK.

92
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,879
So it's a period of time that there's no snow.

93
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,259
There's no water.

94
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,240
There's no rain.

95
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:49,800
There's nothing.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,060
It's very, very dry.

97
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,360
We're going through a drought.

98
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:52,800
Correct.

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,420
And the problem with a drought is very dangerous is because people cannot grow food in a drought.

100
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,160
And so lots of people starve when this happens.

101
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,199
So you've got to watch out for a drought.

102
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:12,959
Now in this case, it not only affected farming, but also we have a hydroelectric power plant that can't work, obviously, because there's no water.

103
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,579
So hydro means water.

104
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,439
Hydroelectric means electricity that is generated by flowing water.

105
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:27,759
And so, for example, a mill, something that turns water on a river is a way to get power from water.

106
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:35,199
But a hydroelectric project that can give you electricity is maybe like a dam or an electric mill.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,160
So usually you have these in rivers, and they just take advantage of the flowing of water to turn some huge turbines and generate power.

108
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,839
So that's all we have for now.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,800
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back shortly to take a look at some more words.

110
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,220
Not a great week for the world.

111
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,279
Any good news?

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,839
I'm afraid not, Bob.

113
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,279
One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the region.

114
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:08,879
Meanwhile, Mexico's coast has been hit by Hurricane Liliana, and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami made hit Central America, affecting Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama.

115
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,060
That's all the news we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on the 6 o'clock news.

116
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,220
Back to you, Bob.

117
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,259
Well, a word that many people are unfortunately familiar with is Richter or Richter scale.

118
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:34,019
And now this is something that a lot of people are talking about right now because of the earthquake in Sichuan, China last year and the earthquake in Haiti very recently.

119
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:45,379
And so the Richter scale, that's a big R because it's a proper name, is a way for us to determine how severe, how big the earthquake was.

120
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,740
So people talk about a 6.0, a 7.1.

121
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,919
So that's on the Richter scale.

122
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,679
The lowest is zero and the highest is 10, correct?

123
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,240
Right.

124
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,399
But 10 is like impossible, apparently.

125
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:58,059
Apparently.

126
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:04,720
And a lot of them are actually underwater, but the very serious ones are maybe 8.0, 7.0.

127
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:06,139
All right.

128
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:08,019
So Richter scale.

129
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,759
Now we talked about earthquakes, we talk about snowing.

130
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,039
Now let's talk about a volcano.

131
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,860
A volcano in Mexico has erupted.

132
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:17,860
Okay.

133
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,700
So we've got two words here, volcano.

134
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:27,759
A volcano is a mountain that has an opening in the center where lava from the middle of the earth, the center of the earth, can come out.

135
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,240
So it's very dangerous, obviously, because it's very hot.

136
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,360
But a volcano doesn't open, it erupts.

137
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,899
So the verb here that we use with a volcano is to erupt.

138
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,019
Okay, so it doesn't explode, a volcano erupts.

139
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,600
That means to open violently very quickly.

140
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:45,360
Okay.

141
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:54,919
So when this happens, obviously you have a lot of lava, you have maybe snow that melts, and you have floods and landslides.

142
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,399
Okay, landslides.

143
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,559
A landslide is one word, but it's made up of two words that you probably already know.

144
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,480
So land, obviously it's the ground and things like that, the earth.

145
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,360
But a slide is to move down across the ground.

146
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:23,080
And so a landslide happens when you've got something like lava or water that's pushing all of the earth, all of the ground down, and it's destroying houses and trees and land, and it's very, very destructive.

147
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:32,159
So you usually see this that happens on the side of mountains or on the side of hills where all that land starts to slide down or to go down.

148
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,419
And it's very similar to an avalanche, right?

149
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,240
But instead of snow falling down, it's a land.

150
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,159
Mud and land.

151
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:38,440
Mud, yeah.

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,639
All right, so we have a landslide.

153
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:48,580
And because of all the eruptions and the earthquakes, they said that they have a lot of seismic activity.

154
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,940
This word seismic is something that I've heard a lot recently in movies, like 2012.

155
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,639
So seismic means having to do with the movement of the plates under the earth's crust.

156
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,980
So, you know, the earth is not everything that we see.

157
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,200
It's also activity, things happening underneath the ground.

158
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,799
And so underneath the ground, we have these big plates.

159
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:14,840
And seismic activity is what happens when these kind of things start to move.

160
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,440
Activity is movement.

161
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:24,779
And so seismic activity refers to earthquakes and volcanoes, things that are changing under the ground that will affect us.

162
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,360
Okay.

163
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,179
So that's seismic activity.

164
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,840
It's pronounced seismic, right?

165
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:29,419
Seismic.

166
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:29,700
Seismic.

167
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,080
That's correct.

168
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:30,940
Okay.

169
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,299
And because of all this activity, people say that they may have a tsunami.

170
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,759
Well, this doesn't sound very English, does it?

171
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,919
I know, tsunami.

172
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,980
And actually, if you see the spelling, it's with a T.

173
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,600
T-S.

174
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,159
Right.

175
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,899
I think it's a Japanese word, but I'm not positive.

176
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,659
I think so, too.

177
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,580
Tsunami is the name that we give to a giant tidal wave.

178
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,620
So that's a wave of water in the ocean that's very, very dangerous because it can get to 100, 200 feet tall.

179
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:04,320
And this means that when it comes down, it can destroy houses, cities, cars, things like that.

180
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,559
And there was a very, very famous tsunami in Southeast Asia in 2004.

181
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,120
Do you remember that?

182
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,879
And in Indonesia, right?

183
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,379
That's right.

184
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,799
In Indonesia and Thailand and Vietnam.

185
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:14,940
Yeah.

186
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,940
It was intense.

187
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,480
It was big.

188
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,399
And it was also because of an earthquake, right?

189
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:19,360
I think so.

190
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:28,539
All these earthquakes, they move the earth around and then all of a sudden the reaction is that there's water that moves and the water then turns into a wave.

191
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:37,460
Just imagine what happens if you have a bucket of water and then you start moving the bucket just a little bit and you see how water starts to splat all over the place.

192
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,200
That's right.

193
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:38,759
All right.

194
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,960
So tsunami was our last word for today.

195
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:44,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back shortly.

196
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:01,019
Those are the headlines for today and now for the International Weather Report with Mike Sanderson.

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,460
Thank you, Bob.

198
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:09,899
This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many as a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world.

199
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:13,700
In Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported in the Alps.

200
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:15,740
Fortunately, no one was injured.

201
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,659
Due to the extreme cold this winter, a blizzard has struck the U.S.

202
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,960
Midwest, causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled.

203
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:35,399
Moving on to Latin America, Ecuador has suffered a six-month drought that has not only affected farming but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country.

204
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,860
In Chile, a major earthquake that registered 7.5 on the Richter scale struck the southern region.

205
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,200
Losses are reported to be in the billions.

206
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,759
Authorities have not yet released an official statement.

207
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,120
Not a great week for the world.

208
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,200
Any good news?

209
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,980
I'm afraid not, Bob.

210
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,399
One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the region.

211
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:08,980
Meanwhile, Mexico's coast has been hit by Hurricane Liliana, and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami made hit Central America, affecting Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama.

212
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,179
That's all the news we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on the 6 o'clock news.

213
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,399
Back to you, Bob.

214
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,720
So Marco, these are all pretty terrifying.

215
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,399
Have you ever experienced a meteorological event like one of the ones that we talked about today?

216
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,460
I've actually lived through like three earthquakes.

217
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:38,200
Like pretty big ones.

218
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,759
Well, that's because you used to live in Los Angeles.

219
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,000
So that way you get them all the time in LA.

220
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:52,700
Apart from that, I've seen a volcano erupt a couple of times, because Ecuador is part of the volcano alley, right?

221
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:57,700
It's all the Andes Mountains, and it's part of the circle of fire, what they call it.

222
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:04,419
So we have a couple of different active volcanoes, and from time to time they will start to smoke or spew some lava, but nothing major.

223
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,559
There hasn't been a major catastrophe with the volcanoes.

224
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,000
Hopefully it won't either.

225
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:27,039
Well, and these days they have a lot of equipment, seismic equipment and meteorological equipment, that can help meteorologists to determine when things will happen, like when a volcano will erupt or if there will be an earthquake, because they can study the tremors in the ground.

226
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah, and I think probably the most famous volcano is, I think it was in Italy, right?

227
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,580
Mount Vesuvius.

228
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,419
That's right.

229
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:46,159
So you've got Mount Vesuvius in Naples, which famously destroyed a number of cities in this ancient civilization, in ancient Roman times.

230
00:15:46,720 --> 00:16:11,480
It was, and what's amazing is that they still have a lot of the buildings under the ash, because when all the ash settled it preserved the bodies like a mummy, and so you can see the bodies and the things that they, you know, their jewelry and their money, and it's fascinating because it's this horrible, horrible natural disaster, actually helped us in the future learn about this old civilization.

231
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:32,120
Yeah, it's crazy, actually in Ecuador you can see a huge hole that has like a lake in the middle, and you're like, oh wow, that's beautiful, but that's actually caused because the entire mountain just kind of blew the top off, like the cone, because of this major eruption, so you can just imagine how powerful these eruptions are.

232
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,740
I can just imagine what it would have been like, Mount Vesuvius.

233
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:47,039
But anyway, on a brighter note, if you have any questions, any comments, or any stories of your own, maybe you've lived through a typhoon, a hurricane, a tornado, you can come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

234
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,980
We hope to see you there.

235
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:48,480
All right.

236
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:48,899
Bye guys.
