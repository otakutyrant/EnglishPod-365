00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,440
EnglishPod.com I'm hungry.

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:07,820
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,500
Sure.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,740
How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches?

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,800
Nah, let's get a burger and fries.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,519
What you ever do is have unhealthy fast food.

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,800
Pizza, fries, burgers, and hot dogs.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,620
You have to start eating better.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,420
I have salads sometimes.

11
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,280
Yeah, right.

12
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,379
I'm serious.

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,859
You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well.

14
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:29,899
You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup.

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,239
It's really not healthy.

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,240
Fine.

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,259
I'll start drinking water and having home cooked meals that are low in fat.

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,179
Are you happy now?

19
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,359
It's a start, but I'll be happy when I see you stick to your promise.
