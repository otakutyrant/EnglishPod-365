1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
EnglishPod.com I'm hungry.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Sure.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Nah, let's get a burger and fries.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What you ever do is have unhealthy fast food.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Pizza, fries, burgers, and hot dogs.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You have to start eating better.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I have salads sometimes.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah, right.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm serious.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's really not healthy.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Fine.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll start drinking water and having home cooked meals that are low in fat.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you happy now?

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's a start, but I'll be happy when I see you stick to your promise.
