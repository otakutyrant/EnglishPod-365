00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:05,799
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,099
And my name is Katherine, and we've got a special announcement to make today.

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:10,720
That's right.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,640
This is lesson number 200.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,339
Woohoo!

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:13,980
Woohoo!

8
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,160
So good job, EnglishPod.

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,399
We have over 200 lessons already in our library, so that's like enough for like six months of continuous learning, I think.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,719
But the lessons keep coming and they keep getting better, so of course you should continue to listen to us.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,920
We just thought we would mention that today is the special number 200.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:30,640
Exactly.

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,920
And because it's a special number, we're going to talk about a very laid-back topic but very interesting nonetheless.

14
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,460
We're talking about junk food.

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,060
You might argue that it's actually too laid-back and is the cause of many problems in America and other places in the world.

16
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,640
Junk food is unhealthy food.

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,380
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,079
I'm hungry.

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,500
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

20
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:00,159
Sure.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,380
How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches?

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,480
Nah, let's get a burger and fries.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,180
What you ever do is have unhealthy fast food.

24
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:09,459
Pizza, fries, burgers, and hot dogs.

25
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,280
You have to start eating better.

26
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,620
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,060
I have salads sometimes.

28
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:14,959
Yeah, right.

29
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,040
I'm serious.

30
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,500
You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well.

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,560
You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup.

32
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,900
It's really not healthy.

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:23,840
Fine.

34
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:26,920
I'll start drinking water and having home-cooked meals that are low in fat.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,900
Are you happy now?

36
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:31,040
It's a start, but I'll be happy when I see you stick to your promise.

37
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,959
All right, we're back.

38
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:41,859
So let's take a look at some of the great words and phrases all about junk food now in Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:48,000
My favorite.

40
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,439
This stuff makes me hungry, but it's not very good for you.

41
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:50,879
It's not.

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,579
It's terrible.

43
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,219
And especially his favorite food was burger and fries.

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,980
Oh, I had it for dinner last night.

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:57,659
Really?

46
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:58,579
You had burger and fries?

47
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,359
Yeah, maybe.

48
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,120
Well, it's not very healthy, and there's a great way to describe this.

49
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,459
The word is unhealthy.

50
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,680
All right, so yes, as you say, it's very unhealthy.

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,699
Well, yeah, because you get fat.

52
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,460
They're very high in calories, so it's unhealthy.

53
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,879
So that means it's not good for you.

54
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,419
That's right.

55
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:23,939
So just a reminder, in English, when we hear the word unhealthy or unhappy, this means not healthy, not happy.

56
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,139
Un is a prefix that means not.

57
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,500
Okay, and talking about unhealthy food, in general, what are we talking about?

58
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,120
We're talking about fast food.

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,240
Okay, so this might require a story.

60
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,479
What is the meaning behind fast food as opposed to slow food?

61
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,000
Because there is no slow food, right?

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,439
I think now they have it in France or something like that.

63
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,919
They talk about slow food.

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,379
But anyways, fast food is food that is prepared very quickly.

65
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:51,560
So you go, you order.

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,900
In two or three minutes, you have your entire order ready to go.

67
00:02:55,539 --> 00:03:06,800
Okay, so maybe this is the food that I could get at McDonald's or Burger King, where they make it very, very quickly, and I can go home or I can go to the office with my food ready.

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,479
Exactly.

69
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:17,979
So fast food, very popular among countries, very popular nowadays among busy people who have no time to sit down at a restaurant or eat or sit down and have a proper lunch.

70
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:18,900
Fast food.

71
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:25,259
And one of the important drinks at a fast food restaurant is a carbonated drink.

72
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,900
So this carbonated, what does this mean?

73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,520
This is actually the fancy word for soda or for fizzy drink.

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,340
Fizzy, okay, so something that's carbonated has bubbles.

75
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,520
Yeah, it has bubbles.

76
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,780
For example, a lot of Europeans drink carbonated water.

77
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,740
That means water with bubbles in it.

78
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,840
That's right.

79
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:50,840
So actually the bubbles are caused because the drink has a high concentration of a certain gas, such as carbon.

80
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:55,159
So that's why it has all these bubbles and it's fizzy, like Coca-Cola, for example.

81
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:56,780
Right, Coca-Cola or Sprite.

82
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,319
These are carbonated drinks.

83
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:58,939
Very good.

84
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,719
So you have carbonated water and you have carbonated soda.

85
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,719
So what is the thing that makes soda different?

86
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,560
What is it that makes soda taste so good?

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,080
It's sweet.

88
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,919
And the ingredient that makes it sweet is called fructose syrup.

89
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,840
Fructose syrup is essentially sugar.

90
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,240
Yeah, and it comes from corn, I believe, right?

91
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,699
That's right.

92
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,019
So you can also hear the name corn syrup.

93
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:29,680
And this is a sweet syrup that comes from corn that makes drinks like Sprite and Coca-Cola taste so good.

94
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,920
It's also very unhealthy for you.

95
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:34,439
Yes, because it has a lot of calories.

96
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,720
So that is one of the main ingredients in soda.

97
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,420
Now you know.

98
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,120
You have fructose syrup.

99
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,319
Alright, so that's all we've got for Language Takeaway.

100
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,180
Let's take another listen to today's dialogue.

101
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,240
We'll be back in a second.

102
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,620
I'm hungry.

103
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,959
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

104
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:52,699
Sure.

105
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,899
How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches?

106
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:56,959
Nah, let's get a burger and fries.

107
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,720
What you ever do is have unhealthy fast food.

108
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,980
Pizza, fries, burgers, and hot dogs.

109
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,800
You have to start eating better.

110
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,139
What are you talking about?

111
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,159
I have salads sometimes.

112
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:07,459
Yeah, right.

113
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,560
I'm serious.

114
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,040
You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well.

115
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,060
You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup.

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,420
It's really not healthy.

117
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,439
Fine.

118
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:19,439
I'll start drinking water and having home cooked meals that are low in fat.

119
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,360
Are you happy now?

120
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:23,519
It's a start, but I'll be happy when I see you stick to your promise.

121
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,819
Alright, we're back.

122
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,660
So now we have a couple of great phrases that we heard along the dialogue.

123
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,980
So let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,420
Alright, so starting off, this is a very interesting phrase because we saw it in the first sentence.

125
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,540
And it says, let's go grab a bite to eat.

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,180
Let's grab a bite to eat.

127
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,639
So to grab is to hold something with your hand, okay?

128
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:52,500
To do it quickly.

129
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,240
He grabbed my arm.

130
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,160
So to grab a bite to eat.

131
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,300
A bite is a small taste.

132
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,240
We're going to have a quick meal.

133
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,279
So after work, you want to go grab a bite to eat?

134
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,800
That means let's go have something to eat quickly.

135
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,360
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

136
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,899
Let me just grab a bite to eat.

137
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,519
So a bite is a little bit.

138
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,959
It's a small amount of food.

139
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,160
Now for our next phrase.

140
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,459
It's very important because I've noticed that a lot of our English learners make the mistake of using this phrase.

141
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,980
It's how about.

142
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,420
How about.

143
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:29,259
So in today's dialogue, the phrase is how about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches?

144
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:37,500
So how about is used as a suggestion is how do you feel or what do you think of going home and preparing a couple of sandwiches?

145
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,439
So another way to say this is why don't we go home and prepare some sandwiches?

146
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,160
Exactly.

147
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:51,360
But commonly, English learners make the mistake of using how about as a way of saying how was it or how is it?

148
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,680
So, for example, how about your weekend?

149
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:54,980
Wrong.

150
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:55,819
Okay.

151
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,560
So how was your weekend?

152
00:06:58,379 --> 00:06:58,399
Exactly.

153
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,899
So how about is usually used when we make a suggestion.

154
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,259
How about we go see a movie on Saturday?

155
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,040
Or how about we go to my parents' house for Christmas this year?

156
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:17,720
Or finally, how about you get another job so that we can have more money to spend on going out to eat?

157
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,519
Very good.

158
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,379
So how about these are all suggestions.

159
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,939
Why don't you get another job?

160
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,680
Why don't we go to our parents' house for Christmas?

161
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,980
So you can't say, hmm, how about your weekend?

162
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,579
You say, how was your weekend?

163
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:30,860
Yeah.

164
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,100
So there's a big difference there.

165
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,639
Very good.

166
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,259
So make sure to stay away from that typical mistake using how about.

167
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,180
Now, moving on, we were talking about fast food and how it's bad for you and she said, you know what?

168
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,560
You should also cut down on your sugar intake.

169
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,319
So to cut down, that's a phrasal verb.

170
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:48,920
That's right.

171
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,240
Cut down.

172
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,920
So that means to decrease.

173
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,180
I'm trying to cut down on the amount of soda that I drink.

174
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,819
Or I'm trying to cut down on how much I spend on the weekends.

175
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,459
OK, so to cut down means to decrease or to lessen.

176
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,600
Very good.

177
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,740
And for our last phrase, the whole thing that we're talking about and one of the favorite meals for everyone, burger and fries.

178
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,220
OK, so this is one of many combinations for meals.

179
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,399
You can have burger and fries, which is a hamburger and french fries.

180
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,060
So oftentimes you say, hey, let's go grab a burger and fries.

181
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,579
Yeah.

182
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,300
Another combination, especially in England, is fish and chips.

183
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,500
Yeah, fish and chips.

184
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,820
Fish would be a fried fish sandwich and chips would be french fries as well.

185
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,600
That's right.

186
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,379
So and actually in England, they call french fries, they call them chips.

187
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:47,779
So if you're confused by the word chips or potato chips and french fries, these are different things in different places.

188
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,659
But if you're talking to an American, french fries is the way to go.

189
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,940
Or for a while they were called freedom fries.

190
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,679
Well, we don't need to talk about that.

191
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,679
We can talk about that in a later lesson.

192
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,840
But for now, the phrase is burger and fries.

193
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,419
All right.

194
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the very last time.

195
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,639
I'm hungry.

196
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,000
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

197
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:13,679
Sure.

198
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,919
How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches?

199
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,000
Nah, let's get a burger and fries.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
What you ever do is have unhealthy fast food.

201
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,980
Pizza, fries, burgers and hot dogs.

202
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:24,799
You have to start eating better.

203
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,139
What are you talking about?

204
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,180
I have salads sometimes.

205
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,480
Yeah, right.

206
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,580
I'm serious.

207
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,039
You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well.

208
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,080
You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup.

209
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,419
It's really not healthy.

210
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:37,460
Fine.

211
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,460
I'll start drinking water and having home cooked meals that are low in fat.

212
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,379
Are you happy now?

213
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,519
It's a start, but I'll be happy when I see you stick to your promise.

214
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:52,460
We're back, Marco.

215
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,179
You're laughing.

216
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,159
I know you like junk food.

217
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,679
What's your favorite junk food of all time?

218
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,059
Actually, I am a big, big fan of fried chicken.

219
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,340
I love fried chicken.

220
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:03,840
Yummy.

221
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,460
I don't know.

222
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:10,019
I think it's really greasy and oily and it's very, very bad, but I can't help it.

223
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,539
It's very good.

224
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,460
You can buy bags of it in America.

225
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:13,120
I know.

226
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,399
Like a pound bag of fried chicken.

227
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,480
You buy it by the pound in America, right?

228
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,759
Yep.

229
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,860
You pay for how much it weighs.

230
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:19,480
Wow.

231
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,200
That's amazing.

232
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:25,519
I actually really enjoy it, but places like Kentucky Fried Chicken, they're too expensive for fried chicken.

233
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,019
Yeah.

234
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,980
You don't necessarily want to go there.

235
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,019
There's other places that are a lot more maybe traditional that are pretty good.

236
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:33,720
How about you?

237
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,000
What is your favorite junk food?

238
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:38,200
Chicago style hot dog and french fries.

239
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,580
When you go to see a baseball game, you get a hot dog, but Chicago style is good.

240
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,059
It's not too much stuff on it.

241
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:55,240
You have a poppy seed bun, so it's a bun, a piece of bread with some seeds on it and a lot of mustard and ketchup and onions.

242
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,220
I really enjoy hot dogs, but the one thing that I cannot have on a hot dog is mustard or relish.

243
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,519
Oh my gosh.

244
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,740
Those are the two best things.

245
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,220
Okay, I can't talk to you anymore.

246
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,340
Well, tell us what your favorite junk food is and tell Marco that he's crazy if he doesn't like mustard.
