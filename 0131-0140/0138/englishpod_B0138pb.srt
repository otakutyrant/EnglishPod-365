00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Catherine.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What do you got, Catherine, for us today?

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's a good question.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, we've got a little bit of a Seinfeld situation.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, for those of you who are not familiar with this American TV show, which, by the way, is one of my favorites, Seinfeld is a TV show, a comedy, about very awkward, very common situations that are taken to the extreme.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Right, so it's a very popular show.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It was around for like 10 years, but it's not airing anymore.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, they're not making new episodes anymore.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No, you have to see them in reruns.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Reruns, right.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, we have a situation that's very common, and it was pretty funny on the show.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's a guy trying to rent a car.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, so he's probably at the airport or traveling, and he's had a long flight, and he wants to rent a car, but, of course, there are some problems.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, this is an elementary-level lesson, by the way, so keep that in mind as we listen to this dialogue one time.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But the reservation keeps the car here.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's why you have the reservation.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I know why we have reservations.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't think you do.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If you did, I'd have a car.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
See, you know how to take the reservation.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You just don't know how to hold the reservation, and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Anybody can just take them.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But we do have a compact or an SUV, if you'd like.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Fine.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll take the compact.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,000
All right.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Fox.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Would you like insurance?

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right, great.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, this actually happens a lot.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You make a reservation, and either they lose it or they run out of cars.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's such a common situation.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And it's not just cars.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sometimes this happens at restaurants, too, and it really makes me angry.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah, that happens a lot.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You show up, and they're like, oh, we don't have a reservation, and you're just like...

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, then you have to keep yourself in check.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You can't really get angry, but this guy does.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So, let's take a look at the language takeaway to find out what are some of the words we're using here to describe renting a car and what kind of car we're talking about.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Language takeaway.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, as you mentioned, at rental places, they have different size cars, different size vehicles.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Which, by the way, costs different prices.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Right.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So, let's take a look at the sizes that they mentioned in dialogue.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Starting with the cheapest one, the least expensive and the smallest, it's a compact vehicle.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All right, compact.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So, compact actually means small.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Small.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Right.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So, compact car, you're going to hear very often.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Even if you're buying a car, let's think of an...

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What's a compact car?

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The VW Golf is a compact car, very small car.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So, usually it's two doors, or if it's a four-door car, it's very small.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Not very long, right?

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Right, exactly.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So, maybe like a Ford Focus could be a small car, compact.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Now, moving up in size a little bit, we would have a mid-size vehicle.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay, mid-size vehicle is...

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Well, it's a giveaway here because mid means middle.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So, it's kind of in the middle between the small and the large.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And this is your average four-door sedan car.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So, as an example, you would have a Ford Taurus or maybe a Toyota Camry.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, Toyota Camry is maybe the most common car.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, definitely.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's kind of expensive, but it's still mid-size, right?

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Exactly.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And now, a bigger car and probably one of the most popular cars in the United States is an SUV.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Not anymore, Marco.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I know.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
With the energy crisis and the...

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Gas prices.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, and the economy as well.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
People are not driving their SUVs anymore.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But SUV is an acronym.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That means it stands for three different words.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
S meaning...

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sports.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
U meaning...

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
V...

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Vehicle.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
All right.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thank you.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, SUV.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Sport Utility Vehicle.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It means it can go maybe off-road.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Right.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So, an example of this would be a Ford Explorer or...

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Jeep Cherokee.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
A Jeep Cherokee could be an SUV as well.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So, right.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Those are three different types of cars.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now, obviously, there are many more like a van or a...

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A limo.

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
A limo, like a limousine.

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But yeah, these are the most common ones that you would rent at a car rental place.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, definitely.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But what we have to do here is make a reservation.

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now, interesting.

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You make a reservation.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah, you don't have it.

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You don't do it.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You don't...

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You make it.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, you make...

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
These are words that go together.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So, we're going to keep them together.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can call a restaurant.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So, say, for example, Marco works at a restaurant.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I say, Hello.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'd like to make a reservation for tonight.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, okay.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Perfect.

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Now, if you show up at the restaurant, you say...

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Where's my table?

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I made a reservation.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And, of course, I throw a fit because there's no table for me.

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So, you make a reservation.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And in this case, it was made before.

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay.

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So, you make a reservation.

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now, why was this guy angry at the rental car place?

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, long story short, the company ran out of cars.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Not all cars.

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Just the car that he wanted.

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The mid-sized vehicle.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, they ran out.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So, that doesn't mean they're actually running somewhere.

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No, they're not putting on their running shoes and going for a jog.

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Now, in this case, to run out, or in this case, we ran out, means that they don't have anymore.

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You don't have anymore.

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Exactly.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I think this word is a nice word for us to take a look at some other examples now.

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Example one.

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We're going to run out of gasoline.

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You need to find a gas station soon.

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Example two.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Can you buy some milk on your way home?

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We ran out last night.

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Example three.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
My pen ran out of ink.

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Can you lend me one, please?

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Not a fun phrase, but an important one in case you're ever in a restaurant, or in a hotel, or in a place where you can purchase something, or rent something, and it's all gone.

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
All right.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So, I think we've taken a look at a lot of great words here.

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So, let's listen to this dialogue again.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We're going to slow it down just a little bit, and then we'll come back and explain some phrases.

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hi.

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I made a reservation for a mid-sized vehicle.

157
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The name is Jimmy Fox.

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We have no mid-size available at the moment.

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't understand.

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I made a reservation.

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do you have my reservation?

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes, we do.

164
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But the reservation keeps the car here.

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's why you have the reservation.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I know why we have reservations.

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't think you do.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If you did, I'd have a car.

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
See, you know how to take the reservation.

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You just don't know how to hold the reservation, and that's really the most important part of the But we do have a compact or an SUV if you'd like.

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Fine.

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll take the compact.

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
All right.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr.

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Fox.

177
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Would you like insurance?

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And we're back.

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So, Marco, we've got a couple phrases here that deserve some attention.

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So, let's take a look at them in today's Fluency Builder.

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Fluency Builder.

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So, the first phrase that I want to take a look at is when the agent says, I'm sorry, we have no midsize available at the moment.

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
OK, so do they or do they not have any?

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah, she says we have no midsize.

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
OK, so another way to say this is we haven't got any.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh, we don't have any.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
OK, but in this case, you can just simplify it and say we have no.

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why wouldn't you say we have none?

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Good question.

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why?

192
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Because we need a thing here.

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We have no cars.

194
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We have no cake.

195
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We have no food.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, this is a very common phrase in English.

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And remember to put the thing at the end.

198
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So, for example, can I say I have no money?

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Absolutely.

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm so sorry, Marco, but I'm not going to lend you.

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I have no money.

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Seriously, lend me something.

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So, have no.

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is interesting, because this is not a structure that is usually learned through textbooks, right?

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You usually say I don't have or we haven't got.

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Exactly.

207
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is very spoken, because you would never say I go no.

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Right, exactly.

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Right.

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We have to talk about something that has an object, something that we have.

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So, here I have no is very spoken, very common.

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's got another phrase that is also not taught so much in those textbooks that we were just mentioning.

213
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So, what's that phrase at the end?

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, it's a threat.

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The guy is so angry, he leans over the counter and he points his finger in the agent's face.

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And what does he say?

217
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He says, yeah, you better give me the insurance.

218
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You better.

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You better.

220
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
All right.

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, you better than me?

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
No, no, it's not like better, like something is good, right?

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You'd better is like a suggestion, but a very strong one.

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay, very strong.

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This is a threat.

226
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah.

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You better eat your dinner or I'm going to send you to your room.

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Exactly.

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So, as you can see, he says you better.

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You better give me the insurance.

231
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But the grammatically correct way would be...

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You had better.

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You had better.

234
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So, the contraction would be you'd better.

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Exactly.

236
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You'd.

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You had better do this.

238
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So, this is a hypothetical situation.

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You had better do this.

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you don't do this, bad things will happen.

241
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Remember that here we've got the grammatically correct form that you should write.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You'd better or the spoken form.

243
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You better.

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You better.

245
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I think in this one we should also listen to some other examples to get a better idea of how we can use this very strong suggestion.

246
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Example one.

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You better go to the doctor before that cold gets any worse.

248
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Example two.

249
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You better watch out.

250
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's dangerous to go out this late.

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Example three.

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
She better change her attitude or her boss is going to fire her.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So, what is the threat?

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You better give me insurance because what is he going to do?

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He says I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay, so this is future.

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm going to.

258
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm gonna.

259
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Right.

260
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Beat the hell out of this car.

261
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So, this is very strong, right?

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, it's very strong and he's saying he is going to destroy the car.

263
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So, beat the hell out of.

264
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So, that means really just do damage to something.

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So, you can use it towards a person also.

266
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's like I'm going to beat the hell out of you.

267
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And I'll arrest you for violence.

268
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Right.

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So, it's a very strong phrase.

270
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It shows anger.

271
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It shows that you are threatening somebody so it's not obviously it's not polite.

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And it might get you a broken nose in a bar if you ever say this to someone or about someone.

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So, be very careful.

274
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Right, but you can use it to describe a situation, right?

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He's like, yeah, we went to a bar yesterday and Dan beat the hell out of the bartender.

276
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Right.

277
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So, instead of just saying Dan hit the bartender or Dan got into a fight, you're saying he hit him and he just.

278
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And he kept hitting him and kept hitting him and kept hitting him.

279
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So, yeah, he beat the hell out of him.

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
All right, great.

281
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So, those are the phrases and words that we wanted to talk about today.

282
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But I think it'd be good if we listen to this dialogue one more time just to get a good feel for it.

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
When we come back, we'll be talking a little bit more about the process of renting a car.

284
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hi, I made a reservation for a mid-sized vehicle.

285
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The name is Jimmy Fox.

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.

287
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't understand.

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I made a reservation.

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Do you have my reservation?

290
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes, we do.

291
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

292
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But the reservation keeps the car here.

293
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's why you have the reservation.

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I know why we have reservations.

295
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't think you do.

296
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If you did, I'd have a car.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
See, you know how to take the reservation.

298
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You just don't know how to hold the reservation.

299
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.

300
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Anybody can just take them.

301
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But we do have a compact or an SUV if you'd like.

302
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Fine.

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll take the compact.

304
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
All right.

305
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr.

306
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Fox.

307
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Would you like insurance?

308
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah, you better give me the insurance because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

309
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You know, I heard that in Florida or in certain cities of California and Florida, you can actually rent luxury cars.

310
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh yeah, you can do that in most places.

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You can rent like a Porsche or a Lamborghini or a Ferrari.

312
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Obviously, it costs a lot of money, but it gives you the opportunity to maybe drive one of these cars that you obviously wouldn't have the money to buy.

313
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, especially if you're talking about those warm places like Florida or California, you want to be in the sunshine, you get a convertible.

314
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You got to get a convertible.

315
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah, so I think the insurance premiums on those particular cars are very high though.

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So you're not only paying for the car, but you're also paying for the insurance and possibly the speeding tickets.

317
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, of course, I can't imagine renting one of those cars and not getting a speeding ticket.

318
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Exactly.

319
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So if any of you out there have experience renting cars, or you have some questions about the specifics that are involved in this process, let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.
