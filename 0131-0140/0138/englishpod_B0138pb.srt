00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:04,580
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,339
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:06,240
Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,040
My name is Catherine.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,400
What do you got, Catherine, for us today?

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,779
That's a good question.

7
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:12,679
Well, we've got a little bit of a Seinfeld situation.

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:28,120
So, for those of you who are not familiar with this American TV show, which, by the way, is one of my favorites, Seinfeld is a TV show, a comedy, about very awkward, very common situations that are taken to the extreme.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,440
Right, so it's a very popular show.

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,859
It was around for like 10 years, but it's not airing anymore.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,740
Well, they're not making new episodes anymore.

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,600
No, you have to see them in reruns.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,500
Reruns, right.

14
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,420
So, we have a situation that's very common, and it was pretty funny on the show.

15
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,140
It's a guy trying to rent a car.

16
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:55,439
Okay, so he's probably at the airport or traveling, and he's had a long flight, and he wants to rent a car, but, of course, there are some problems.

17
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:01,659
So, this is an elementary-level lesson, by the way, so keep that in mind as we listen to this dialogue one time.

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,180
But the reservation keeps the car here.

19
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,540
That's why you have the reservation.

20
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,239
I know why we have reservations.

21
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,359
I don't think you do.

22
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,379
If you did, I'd have a car.

23
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,079
See, you know how to take the reservation.

24
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:48,340
You just don't know how to hold the reservation, and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.

25
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,959
Anybody can just take them.

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,379
But we do have a compact or an SUV, if you'd like.

27
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:55,319
Fine.

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,939
I'll take the compact.

29
00:01:58,099 --> 00:01:58,599
All right.

30
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,739
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr.

31
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,079
Fox.

32
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,540
Would you like insurance?

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,620
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

34
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,539
All right, great.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,240
So, this actually happens a lot.

36
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:21,580
You make a reservation, and either they lose it or they run out of cars.

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,080
It's such a common situation.

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,979
And it's not just cars.

39
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,800
Sometimes this happens at restaurants, too, and it really makes me angry.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,780
Yeah, that happens a lot.

41
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,979
You show up, and they're like, oh, we don't have a reservation, and you're just like...

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,639
Well, then you have to keep yourself in check.

43
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,500
You can't really get angry, but this guy does.

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:46,599
So, let's take a look at the language takeaway to find out what are some of the words we're using here to describe renting a car and what kind of car we're talking about.

45
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:49,900
Language takeaway.

46
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,759
Well, as you mentioned, at rental places, they have different size cars, different size vehicles.

47
00:02:58,099 --> 00:02:59,939
Which, by the way, costs different prices.

48
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:00,460
Right.

49
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,199
So, let's take a look at the sizes that they mentioned in dialogue.

50
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,199
Starting with the cheapest one, the least expensive and the smallest, it's a compact vehicle.

51
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,500
All right, compact.

52
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,539
So, compact actually means small.

53
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:15,000
Small.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,479
Right.

55
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,659
So, compact car, you're going to hear very often.

56
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,960
Even if you're buying a car, let's think of an...

57
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,860
What's a compact car?

58
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:26,639
The VW Golf is a compact car, very small car.

59
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,599
So, usually it's two doors, or if it's a four-door car, it's very small.

60
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,740
Not very long, right?

61
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,580
Right, exactly.

62
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:35,639
So, maybe like a Ford Focus could be a small car, compact.

63
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,800
Now, moving up in size a little bit, we would have a mid-size vehicle.

64
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,659
Okay, mid-size vehicle is...

65
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,060
Well, it's a giveaway here because mid means middle.

66
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,039
So, it's kind of in the middle between the small and the large.

67
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,639
And this is your average four-door sedan car.

68
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,180
Okay.

69
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,159
So, as an example, you would have a Ford Taurus or maybe a Toyota Camry.

70
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,439
Yeah, Toyota Camry is maybe the most common car.

71
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,039
Yeah, definitely.

72
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,979
It's kind of expensive, but it's still mid-size, right?

73
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:04,340
Exactly.

74
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:11,240
And now, a bigger car and probably one of the most popular cars in the United States is an SUV.

75
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,539
Not anymore, Marco.

76
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,099
I know.

77
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,079
With the energy crisis and the...

78
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,560
Gas prices.

79
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,720
Well, and the economy as well.

80
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,740
People are not driving their SUVs anymore.

81
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,800
But SUV is an acronym.

82
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,899
That means it stands for three different words.

83
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,259
S meaning...

84
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:26,500
Sports.

85
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,699
U meaning...

86
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,519
V...

87
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:29,680
Vehicle.

88
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,240
All right.

89
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:30,600
Thank you.

90
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,319
So, SUV.

91
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,000
Sport Utility Vehicle.

92
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,439
It means it can go maybe off-road.

93
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:34,980
Right.

94
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,379
So, an example of this would be a Ford Explorer or...

95
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:39,939
Jeep Cherokee.

96
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,639
A Jeep Cherokee could be an SUV as well.

97
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:43,180
So, right.

98
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,899
Those are three different types of cars.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,319
Now, obviously, there are many more like a van or a...

100
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,560
A limo.

101
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,199
A limo, like a limousine.

102
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,000
But yeah, these are the most common ones that you would rent at a car rental place.

103
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:56,660
Yeah, definitely.

104
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,680
But what we have to do here is make a reservation.

105
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:02,639
Now, interesting.

106
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,740
You make a reservation.

107
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,040
Yeah, you don't have it.

108
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,000
You don't do it.

109
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:07,480
You don't...

110
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,180
You make it.

111
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,399
Yeah, you make...

112
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,300
These are words that go together.

113
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,399
So, we're going to keep them together.

114
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,079
I can call a restaurant.

115
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,980
So, say, for example, Marco works at a restaurant.

116
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,459
I say, Hello.

117
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,860
I'd like to make a reservation for tonight.

118
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,699
Oh, okay.

119
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,120
Perfect.

120
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,740
Now, if you show up at the restaurant, you say...

121
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,379
Where's my table?

122
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,399
I made a reservation.

123
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:32,240
And, of course, I throw a fit because there's no table for me.

124
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,899
So, you make a reservation.

125
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,339
And in this case, it was made before.

126
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:36,860
Okay.

127
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,060
So, you make a reservation.

128
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,040
Now, why was this guy angry at the rental car place?

129
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,220
Oh, long story short, the company ran out of cars.

130
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:47,860
Okay.

131
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:48,560
Not all cars.

132
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,040
Just the car that he wanted.

133
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,360
The mid-sized vehicle.

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,160
So, they ran out.

135
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,660
So, that doesn't mean they're actually running somewhere.

136
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,259
No, they're not putting on their running shoes and going for a jog.

137
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,920
Now, in this case, to run out, or in this case, we ran out, means that they don't have anymore.

138
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,879
You don't have anymore.

139
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:06,420
Exactly.

140
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,019
I think this word is a nice word for us to take a look at some other examples now.

141
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,139
Example one.

142
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,959
We're going to run out of gasoline.

143
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,019
You need to find a gas station soon.

144
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,899
Example two.

145
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,120
Can you buy some milk on your way home?

146
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,720
We ran out last night.

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Example three.

148
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,680
My pen ran out of ink.

149
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,959
Can you lend me one, please?

150
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:49,519
Not a fun phrase, but an important one in case you're ever in a restaurant, or in a hotel, or in a place where you can purchase something, or rent something, and it's all gone.

151
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,220
All right.

152
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,680
So, I think we've taken a look at a lot of great words here.

153
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,959
So, let's listen to this dialogue again.

154
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,180
We're going to slow it down just a little bit, and then we'll come back and explain some phrases.

155
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,079
Hi.

156
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,339
I made a reservation for a mid-sized vehicle.

157
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:08,879
The name is Jimmy Fox.

158
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,420
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,399
We have no mid-size available at the moment.

160
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:14,860
I don't understand.

161
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,399
I made a reservation.

162
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,060
Do you have my reservation?

163
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
Yes, we do.

164
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,819
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

165
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,199
But the reservation keeps the car here.

166
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,579
That's why you have the reservation.

167
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,259
I know why we have reservations.

168
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,379
I don't think you do.

169
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,399
If you did, I'd have a car.

170
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:40,079
See, you know how to take the reservation.

171
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:52,480
You just don't know how to hold the reservation, and that's really the most important part of the But we do have a compact or an SUV if you'd like.

172
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,399
Fine.

173
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,980
I'll take the compact.

174
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,620
All right.

175
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,720
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr.

176
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:00,079
Fox.

177
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,600
Would you like insurance?

178
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,660
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

179
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,300
And we're back.

180
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,959
So, Marco, we've got a couple phrases here that deserve some attention.

181
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,899
So, let's take a look at them in today's Fluency Builder.

182
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,160
Fluency Builder.

183
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:29,740
So, the first phrase that I want to take a look at is when the agent says, I'm sorry, we have no midsize available at the moment.

184
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,259
OK, so do they or do they not have any?

185
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,159
Yeah, she says we have no midsize.

186
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,700
OK, so another way to say this is we haven't got any.

187
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,340
Oh, we don't have any.

188
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,980
OK, but in this case, you can just simplify it and say we have no.

189
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,000
Why wouldn't you say we have none?

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,779
Good question.

191
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,019
Why?

192
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,580
Because we need a thing here.

193
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,940
We have no cars.

194
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,899
We have no cake.

195
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,059
We have no food.

196
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,580
So, this is a very common phrase in English.

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,559
And remember to put the thing at the end.

198
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,139
So, for example, can I say I have no money?

199
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:05,299
Absolutely.

200
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,299
I'm so sorry, Marco, but I'm not going to lend you.

201
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,980
I have no money.

202
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:08,960
Seriously, lend me something.

203
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,940
So, have no.

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,799
This is interesting, because this is not a structure that is usually learned through textbooks, right?

205
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,879
You usually say I don't have or we haven't got.

206
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:20,539
Exactly.

207
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,159
This is very spoken, because you would never say I go no.

208
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,519
Right, exactly.

209
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,299
Right.

210
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,399
We have to talk about something that has an object, something that we have.

211
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,820
So, here I have no is very spoken, very common.

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,240
It's got another phrase that is also not taught so much in those textbooks that we were just mentioning.

213
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,480
So, what's that phrase at the end?

214
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,899
Well, it's a threat.

215
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,399
The guy is so angry, he leans over the counter and he points his finger in the agent's face.

216
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:53,600
And what does he say?

217
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:56,480
He says, yeah, you better give me the insurance.

218
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,559
You better.

219
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,399
You better.

220
00:09:59,059 --> 00:09:59,399
All right.

221
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,259
So, you better than me?

222
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,059
No, no, it's not like better, like something is good, right?

223
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,100
You'd better is like a suggestion, but a very strong one.

224
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,679
Okay, very strong.

225
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:11,480
This is a threat.

226
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,059
Yeah.

227
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,120
You better eat your dinner or I'm going to send you to your room.

228
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,860
Exactly.

229
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,980
So, as you can see, he says you better.

230
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,879
You better give me the insurance.

231
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,959
But the grammatically correct way would be...

232
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,460
You had better.

233
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,240
You had better.

234
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,759
So, the contraction would be you'd better.

235
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,500
Exactly.

236
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,559
You'd.

237
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,519
You had better do this.

238
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:38,100
So, this is a hypothetical situation.

239
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,139
You had better do this.

240
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,320
If you don't do this, bad things will happen.

241
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,120
Remember that here we've got the grammatically correct form that you should write.

242
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,360
You'd better or the spoken form.

243
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,200
You better.

244
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:48,980
You better.

245
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:57,659
I think in this one we should also listen to some other examples to get a better idea of how we can use this very strong suggestion.

246
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,519
Example one.

247
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,840
You better go to the doctor before that cold gets any worse.

248
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:09,779
Example two.

249
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:12,379
You better watch out.

250
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,960
It's dangerous to go out this late.

251
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:18,500
Example three.

252
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,960
She better change her attitude or her boss is going to fire her.

253
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,860
So, what is the threat?

254
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,539
You better give me insurance because what is he going to do?

255
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,820
He says I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

256
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,399
Okay, so this is future.

257
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,700
I'm going to.

258
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,600
I'm gonna.

259
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,139
Right.

260
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,379
Beat the hell out of this car.

261
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,279
So, this is very strong, right?

262
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,940
Yeah, it's very strong and he's saying he is going to destroy the car.

263
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,519
So, beat the hell out of.

264
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,000
So, that means really just do damage to something.

265
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,379
So, you can use it towards a person also.

266
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,559
It's like I'm going to beat the hell out of you.

267
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,600
And I'll arrest you for violence.

268
00:11:59,279 --> 00:11:59,440
Right.

269
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,980
So, it's a very strong phrase.

270
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:02,299
It shows anger.

271
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,519
It shows that you are threatening somebody so it's not obviously it's not polite.

272
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,440
And it might get you a broken nose in a bar if you ever say this to someone or about someone.

273
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,299
So, be very careful.

274
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,860
Right, but you can use it to describe a situation, right?

275
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,139
He's like, yeah, we went to a bar yesterday and Dan beat the hell out of the bartender.

276
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:23,740
Right.

277
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:33,279
So, instead of just saying Dan hit the bartender or Dan got into a fight, you're saying he hit him and he just.

278
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,259
And he kept hitting him and kept hitting him and kept hitting him.

279
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:38,240
So, yeah, he beat the hell out of him.

280
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,120
All right, great.

281
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,919
So, those are the phrases and words that we wanted to talk about today.

282
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,299
But I think it'd be good if we listen to this dialogue one more time just to get a good feel for it.

283
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,200
When we come back, we'll be talking a little bit more about the process of renting a car.

284
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:59,399
Hi, I made a reservation for a mid-sized vehicle.

285
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,919
The name is Jimmy Fox.

286
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,360
I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.

287
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,860
I don't understand.

288
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,360
I made a reservation.

289
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,039
Do you have my reservation?

290
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,080
Yes, we do.

291
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,799
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

292
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:20,179
But the reservation keeps the car here.

293
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,539
That's why you have the reservation.

294
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,240
I know why we have reservations.

295
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,399
I don't think you do.

296
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,379
If you did, I'd have a car.

297
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,039
See, you know how to take the reservation.

298
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,080
You just don't know how to hold the reservation.

299
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:38,320
And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.

300
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,980
Anybody can just take them.

301
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,419
But we do have a compact or an SUV if you'd like.

302
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,340
Fine.

303
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,940
I'll take the compact.

304
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,600
All right.

305
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,720
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr.

306
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,039
Fox.

307
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,539
Would you like insurance?

308
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,659
Yeah, you better give me the insurance because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

309
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:12,220
You know, I heard that in Florida or in certain cities of California and Florida, you can actually rent luxury cars.

310
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,039
Oh yeah, you can do that in most places.

311
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,559
You can rent like a Porsche or a Lamborghini or a Ferrari.

312
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:27,779
Obviously, it costs a lot of money, but it gives you the opportunity to maybe drive one of these cars that you obviously wouldn't have the money to buy.

313
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,480
Yeah, especially if you're talking about those warm places like Florida or California, you want to be in the sunshine, you get a convertible.

314
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,080
You got to get a convertible.

315
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,840
Yeah, so I think the insurance premiums on those particular cars are very high though.

316
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,639
So you're not only paying for the car, but you're also paying for the insurance and possibly the speeding tickets.

317
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,700
Yeah, of course, I can't imagine renting one of those cars and not getting a speeding ticket.

318
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:51,299
Exactly.

319
00:14:51,639 --> 00:15:02,080
So if any of you out there have experience renting cars, or you have some questions about the specifics that are involved in this process, let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.
