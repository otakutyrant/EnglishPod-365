00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,119
EnglishPod.com That's why you have the reservation.

2
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,840
I know why we have reservations.

3
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,939
I don't think you do.

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,979
If you did, I'd have a car.

5
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,659
See, you know how to take the reservation.

6
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:44,700
You just don't know how to hold the reservation.

7
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,920
And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,560
Anybody can just take them.

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,979
But we do have a compact, or an SUV if you'd like.

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:54,960
Fine.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,539
I'll take the compact.

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,039
Alright.

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,299
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr.

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:01,640
Fox.

15
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,140
Would you like insurance?

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,200
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.
