00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,000
EnglishPod.com That's why you have the reservation.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I know why we have reservations.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't think you do.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If you did, I'd have a car.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
See, you know how to take the reservation.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You just don't know how to hold the reservation.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Anybody can just take them.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But we do have a compact, or an SUV if you'd like.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Fine.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll take the compact.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Alright.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Fox.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Would you like insurance?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.
