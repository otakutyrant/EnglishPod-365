00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:05,820
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,119
And my name is Catherine, and today we're talking about being clean.

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,160
Yeah, we're gonna be doing the laundry, right?

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,019
It's a very important part of everyone's weekly schedule.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:27,519
And not only important, but I find it to be a little bit difficult, because, you know, washing machine, and what clothes you should mix with what, and how much detergent, and how long, it's such a complicated process.

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,880
Well, let's say this, it might not be difficult, but it's very easy to mess up.

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,179
Exactly, yeah, that's the problem.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,740
It's very easy to, like, just ruin your favorite t-shirt if you don't do laundry correctly.

9
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,539
Or all of your white socks turn pink, for example.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,000
Right.

11
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,920
So we're gonna be looking at a lot of vocabulary and phrases related to this topic.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,759
And before we get started with the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,939
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:03,619
Okay, so central to all of these phrases and words that we're gonna be hearing is a thing, an electric thing, that helps us wash our clothes.

15
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,400
Right, a washing machine.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,560
Right, pretty simple, right?

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,799
So washing is to wash washing, and machine, so they go together, washing machine.

18
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,159
Right.

19
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:12,560
Pretty simple.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,000
So it's easy now, you just put all your clothes in this thing, and it washes it for you.

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,519
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

22
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,159
Now, you know, a lot of people don't like to use washing machines.

23
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,959
They say it doesn't really clean the clothes as well as doing it by hand.

24
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:25,560
Really?

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:36,060
Well, I'd say most clothes get washed pretty well with a washing machine, but if you have those hard-to-get stains or some dirt, maybe it's good to have a washing board.

26
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,200
A washing board, yeah.

27
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,040
Yeah, where you can really scrub it yourself.

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,060
And well, funny you mentioned that word stain, because it's our second word that we're gonna preview, a stain.

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:53,959
All right, a stain is some color, maybe some food or wine or grass that you can't remove from your clothes.

30
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,439
Right.

31
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,840
So it's very common.

32
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,579
You're having a nice dinner, and all of a sudden, you spill wine on your shirt.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,079
So you have a wine stain.

34
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,040
I hate that.

35
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,319
And you can also have a stain on your carpet, right?

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,599
So if you spill some coffee on your carpet, it's got a little circle that's brown forever.

37
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,199
Right?

38
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,259
Or even some people have stained teeth, right?

39
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:20,319
That's right, so you can get them turned back white with a little money to your dentist.

40
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,080
Exactly.

41
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:25,080
So those are the two words that we're gonna be looking at today in vocabulary preview.

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,199
So let's listen to our dialogue.

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,759
Let's see what's happening with these people that are doing laundry.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,979
Okay, let's go through this one more time.

45
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:44,460
I don't want any more ruined or dyed blouses.

46
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,719
I know, I know.

47
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:54,060
Okay, so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so-called washing machine.

48
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,759
Right, you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you're washing.

49
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,400
For example, for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle.

50
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,979
Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,520
So complicated.

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,240
Okay, what about this red wine stain?

53
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,740
How do I get it out?

54
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,000
Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.

55
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:17,699
Cool.

56
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,259
Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set, right?

57
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,080
No.

58
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,740
Since you're washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for 20 minutes.

59
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:28,960
You know what?

60
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,960
I'll just have everything dry cleaned.

61
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:46,240
Okay, so we've got someone who is maybe doing the laundry for the first time and he's not really understanding the instructions he's got.

62
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,960
Well, that's the thing I tell you.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,039
It's a little bit difficult and, well, it's very tedious at times to try and do laundry like this.

64
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,099
Well, the first thing that's maybe tedious about it is that you have to really worry about what colors go together.

65
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:05,919
Right, so let's take a look at those words that were related to doing laundry now in Language Takeaway.

66
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,620
Okay, the first word we have is actually related to a joke we made earlier about pink socks.

67
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,339
So if you change the color of something, you're dyeing it.

68
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:20,660
Okay, dye.

69
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:25,579
So it's pronounced exactly the same way as, you know, to die, to not live anymore.

70
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,259
Dye.

71
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,660
But it's spelled differently.

72
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,360
D-Y-E.

73
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,980
Okay, so it can be a verb or an adjective.

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,019
Or a noun.

75
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:34,639
Or a noun.

76
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,899
So something that you put on clothes to change the color is called a dye.

77
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,579
A dye.

78
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,600
But to do this, to change the color of some clothes is to dye the clothes.

79
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,699
So that's maybe what happens when you wash a red t-shirt with all your white t-shirts.

80
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,779
Then you have dyed shirts, you have pink shirts, and ugh.

81
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,259
And also women, when they go to the beauty salon, they dye their hair.

82
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,740
Exactly, so that means you change the color of your hair.

83
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,259
It means it's a long-term change, it's not short, it's not like one date.

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,860
It means probably for a long time.

85
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,980
So that's the correct word, to dye.

86
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,959
Very different, maybe some people say to paint, which, you know, we understand, but the correct form would be to dye.

87
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,360
And next we have a word that describes a certain kind of clothing.

88
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,000
We're not talking about pants or socks, we're talking about delicates.

89
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:24,939
Delicates.

90
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:28,339
So now this adjective, delicate, which means it's very...

91
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:29,040
Easy to break.

92
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:29,879
Fragile, right?

93
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,100
Yeah.

94
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,879
But this is a noun.

95
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,579
Delicates.

96
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,639
Right, so you think of something that's easy to break or to ruin, maybe you think of underwear.

97
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:38,220
Underwear.

98
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:47,480
You know, underwear is something you wear under your clothing, and so it's generally not as strong as a shirt or a pair of jeans, and so we call these in English, delicates.

99
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,500
Very good.

100
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:57,579
So you have to be careful when you're washing your delicates, because it's happened to me before, you put them in with all the clothes and then you have stretched out boxers or something like that.

101
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,959
Yeah, so that's why many women, I know, wash delicates by hand, so you separate the clothes from the delicates.

102
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:04,620
Very good.

103
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:12,279
And now, if you're washing delicates or you're washing towels or t-shirts, it's always a good idea to use fabric softener.

104
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,879
Alright, fabric softener, what are these two words?

105
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,319
One of them you understand already, maybe it's soft softener.

106
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,699
So it makes it soft?

107
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,660
Yeah, it's something that makes something softer.

108
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,120
We've got fabric softener, so that's something that makes the clothes that you wash softer.

109
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:30,399
So fabric is any type of material, right?

110
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,100
Like a textile.

111
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,300
Yeah, so it could be cotton or silk or nylon, linen, so these are all kinds of fabrics.

112
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:42,079
So you pour a little bit of this in your washing machine and your clothes come out really nice and soft.

113
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,420
Mmm, it feels nice just talking about it.

114
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,660
Alright, and well, also to wash your clothes, to actually make them clean, you use detergent.

115
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:58,720
Right, so many people might want to say the word soap, because soap is what we use to wash our hands and our dishes, but here we have detergent.

116
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,480
So this is a special soap for your clothes.

117
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,259
Right, laundry detergent.

118
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:07,620
Yeah, you could just say laundry detergent or simply detergent.

119
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:17,120
And now, in order to remove those nasty stains that maybe are very hard, you would use a chemical called bleach.

120
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:26,420
Alright, so bleach is the dangerous chemical because it smells very strong, and it can change the color of your clothes to white or yellow.

121
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,600
So we usually only use bleach with white clothes.

122
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,199
I actually had a friend who changed the color of his hair to white using bleach.

123
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,120
He put bleach on his head and on his hair and it just turned white.

124
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,699
Oh wow, so many people do that because they want to go from dark colors to light colors.

125
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:48,879
And in that case, you wouldn't say, you could say that he dyed his hair white, but usually you would say he bleached his hair.

126
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,600
So we understand that it turned white.

127
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,540
Exactly.

128
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:57,500
So those five words we just looked at in language takeaway, they're important, they're related to doing laundry.

129
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,399
So before we move on, let's listen to our dialogue again, but a little bit slower.

130
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,019
Okay, let's go through this one more time.

131
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,699
I don't want any more ruined or dyed blouses.

132
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:14,579
I know.

133
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,319
I know.

134
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:24,339
Okay, so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so-called washing machine.

135
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,259
Right.

136
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,000
You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing.

137
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,240
For example, for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle.

138
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:42,700
Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.

139
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,519
So complicated.

140
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,200
Okay, what about this red wine stain?

141
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,860
How do I get it out?

142
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,700
Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,539
Cool.

144
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,340
Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set, right?

145
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,200
No.

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,279
Since you are washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for 20 minutes.

147
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,460
You know what?

148
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,159
I'll just have everything dry clean.

149
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:28,500
So here at EnglishPod, we'd like to also provide you listeners with some phrases that allow you to increase your fluency, so that means sound more like a native English speaker.

150
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,299
And so today let's check out these phrases in Fluency Builder.

151
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,460
Fluency Builder.

152
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,159
Alright, so on Fluency Builder, we're going to be looking at four words or four phrases.

153
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,440
So the first one was really easy.

154
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:48,559
When she was telling the guy or instructing him how to do the laundry, she said, Let's go through this one more time.

155
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,440
Go through what?

156
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,240
The wall?

157
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,600
No, so it's not actually to go through an object, like to pass.

158
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,220
So it's let's repeat or let's rehearse again.

159
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,899
Okay, so normally we say this when there are many different steps to do something.

160
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,940
So let's go through this again.

161
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:23,539
When you leave work, you go home, you unlock the door, you open the door, and then so it means that there's a process, you know, there are many steps and so let's go through this again is a way for us to say let's think about and discuss this process.

162
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:24,559
Very good.

163
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,919
So we also use it maybe when we're studying.

164
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,799
So let's go through this subject one more time.

165
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,279
Can we go through chapter five again?

166
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,399
So you would reread a chapter five.

167
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:40,179
Alright, so why don't we listen to a couple of more examples of how we could use go through.

168
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,320
Example one.

169
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,100
I want to go through chapter five again before the exam tomorrow.

170
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,879
Example two.

171
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,480
David, do you have time this afternoon to go over the details of this new project?

172
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:57,700
Example three.

173
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:05,159
I went through my contract and it says that I am entitled to 15 vacation days a year.

174
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,860
Now this next phrase is very common when we're using sarcasm when we're trying to make jokes.

175
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:13,740
So we say so called.

176
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:14,200
Right.

177
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,440
So she said this so called contraption.

178
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,000
It's like she doubts that it's really a washing machine.

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,500
So I could say her so called boyfriend wants to go out tonight.

180
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,039
So I say that because he doesn't really act like a boyfriend.

181
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:30,740
So you're being sarcastic.

182
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,070
It's a very good way and easy way of demonstrating sarcasm.

183
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:40,080
Yeah, actually in the 1990s in America there was a very famous TV show called My So Called Life.

184
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,080
Alright, so this is my so called life.

185
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,379
It's almost like it's not really like I have any control over it.

186
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,980
Or I don't really have a life because it's kind of boring.

187
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,139
Yeah, so my so called life.

188
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,860
Not bragging.

189
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,600
It's a joke.

190
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,279
So you can say my so called friends, my so called job.

191
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,799
Basically you can almost be sarcastic with anything.

192
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:06,299
Yeah, but be careful that you know that it's a joke because if you're trying to be serious you might make some people angry.

193
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:15,759
And now she was explaining the whole process of how to do it and when she recommended using bleach she said that should do the trick.

194
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:16,600
Trick.

195
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,299
So dogs do tricks, right?

196
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,139
Right, but to do the trick, right?

197
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,460
So it's got a different meaning.

198
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,019
Alright, so she's saying this should work.

199
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,480
This should fix your problem.

200
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,740
So that should do the trick.

201
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:37,139
So Marco, I've been having this itch on my foot and I just can't seem to figure out what to do with it.

202
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,159
Do you have any suggestions?

203
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:42,019
Yeah, you should maybe just put some ointment on it and that should do the trick.

204
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,100
Alright, cool.

205
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:44,179
Thanks for the suggestion.

206
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:45,559
Yeah, so very easy.

207
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,659
It's just a way of saying that should solve your problem.

208
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,500
Alright, great.

209
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,320
So that should do the trick or it will do the trick.

210
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,940
And we have one last phrase, all set.

211
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,320
All set.

212
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:05,240
So this is another phrase that has two words that always go together to mean, well, we're finished, we're done.

213
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,539
Everything is ready.

214
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:07,480
Everything is ready.

215
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,259
We're all set to go on vacation.

216
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:12,259
So my bags are packed, I have my passports, we are all set.

217
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,980
Or after a meeting you can say, are we all set here?

218
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,320
That means, are we finished?

219
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,259
Is it time to leave?

220
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,080
Very good.

221
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,200
So we are almost all set.

222
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,720
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

223
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,860
Okay.

224
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,639
Let's go through this one more time.

225
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:36,120
I don't want any more ruined or dyed blouses.

226
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,399
I know, I know.

227
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,279
Okay.

228
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:45,759
So I had to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so-called washing machine.

229
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:46,460
Right.

230
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,440
You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you're washing.

231
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,080
For example, for delicates you should set a shorter washing cycle.

232
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,659
Also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.

233
00:13:58,259 --> 00:13:59,200
So complicated.

234
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,919
Okay, what about this red wine stain?

235
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,440
How do I get it out?

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,659
Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.

237
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,379
Cool.

238
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,940
Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set, right?

239
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:13,779
No.

240
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:14,200
Yeah.

241
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,480
Since you're washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for 20 minutes.

242
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,639
You know what?

243
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,639
I'll just have everything dry cleaned.

244
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,259
Have you ever had any laundry mishaps?

245
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,700
Have you ever lost a sock?

246
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,759
Died something?

247
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Have I ever.

248
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,980
I hate doing the laundry.

249
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,460
Why?

250
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,700
It's time consuming.

251
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,919
I have no patience.

252
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:54,399
Normally, when I was in college, I would take all of my laundry in a bag and I'd throw it in the washing machine and I'd put it on cold.

253
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,179
Because cold water, it's okay for all colors, but hot water makes the colors bleed.

254
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,399
I took out the clothes and put them in the dryer.

255
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:08,320
Afterwards, I saw all my clothes were clean except for my three sweaters, which were small enough for babies.

256
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Ah, you shrunk it.

257
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,720
I shrunk three brand new sweaters.

258
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:15,179
That's too bad.

259
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,539
The problem that I have when doing laundry is that I forget that I started doing laundry.

260
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:27,340
So all of a sudden, you know, I'm doing laundry in the morning and then clothes are washed, but they're still in the washing machine.

261
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,840
And I remember like the next day.

262
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,240
So then the clothes are like kind of smelling like kind of humid.

263
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Because they're moldy.

264
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,139
So I have to rewash them and it's just like a pain.

265
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,019
Yeah, but doing laundry is sometimes so time consuming.

266
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,539
But let us know what you think.

267
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:45,159
Do you like doing laundry or have you ever lost a sock?

268
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,899
I think everyone has lost a sock or something in their washing, right?

269
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,580
I think there is a secret home for socks somewhere.

270
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:53,139
It's so weird.

271
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:54,960
Maybe it's in Australia or something.

272
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,000
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com.
