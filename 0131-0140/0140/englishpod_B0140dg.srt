00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com So, can you fix it?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm sorry, sir.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This computer is not broken or damaged.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's simply just too old.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's why your programs and applications are running slow.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There really isn't much I can do.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What do you mean?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I bought this computer just three years ago.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes, but technology is ever-changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay, I know where this is going.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It has a 4 gigahertz processor with 16 gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with 1 terabyte.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard, and desk speakers.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I have no idea what you are talking about.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I just want to know if it's good and if I'll be able to play Solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If it does, we'll give you your money back.
