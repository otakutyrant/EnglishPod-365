00:00:01,559 --> 00:00:07,960
EnglishPod.com So, can you fix it?

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,599
I'm sorry, sir.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,839
This computer is not broken or damaged.

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,880
It's simply just too old.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,019
That's why your programs and applications are running slow.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,859
There really isn't much I can do.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,899
What do you mean?

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,399
I bought this computer just three years ago.

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,940
Yes, but technology is ever-changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,559
Okay, I know where this is going.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,100
How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,159
Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,560
It has a 4 gigahertz processor with 16 gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with 1 terabyte.

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,840
Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard, and desk speakers.

15
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,679
I have no idea what you are talking about.

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,859
I just want to know if it's good and if I'll be able to play Solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time.

17
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:00,640
This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,920
If it does, we'll give you your money back.
