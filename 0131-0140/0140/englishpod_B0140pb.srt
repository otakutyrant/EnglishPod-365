00:00:03,619 --> 00:00:04,719
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,099
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:06,759
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,240
And my name is Catherine.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,179
So what are we talking about today, Marco?

6
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:13,539
Well, we're talking about one of my favorite topics, which are computers.

7
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:15,460
Yes, you're a little bit of a nerd.

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,780
A little bit.

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,500
I love computers and technology and everything that's related to it, so that's what we're going to be looking at today.

10
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,160
Maybe we're buying a new computer.

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,359
Well, I anticipate learning something from this because there are a lot of those fancy big words that I don't know that have to do with processors and things.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,539
So that's going to be coming up in a minute here.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,899
But first, let's just jump right in and take a listen to today's dialogue.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,820
So can you fix it?

15
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,420
I'm sorry, sir.

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,679
This computer is not broken or damaged.

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,719
It's simply just too old.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,719
That's What do you mean?

19
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,259
I bought this computer just three years ago.

20
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,799
Yes, but technology is ever-changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster.

21
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,379
Okay, I know where this is going.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,939
How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.

24
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,379
It has a 4 gigahertz processor with 16 gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with 1 terabyte.

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,780
Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard and desk speakers.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,500
I have no idea what you are talking about.

27
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:35,680
I just want to know if it's good and if I'll be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time.

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,519
This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,799
If it does, we'll give you your money back.

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,260
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,620
I think it's a very typical case you go in to get something fixed and they say, we can't fix it.

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,400
You need a new one.

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,280
Yes, and not only a new one, but a bigger and better and faster one.

34
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,599
And more expensive, obviously.

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Obviously.

36
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,379
It's called the upsell.

37
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,719
The upsell, yeah.

38
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:09,280
All right, so there were some very difficult words, I think, because they're very specific related to technology and computers.

39
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,560
So, why don't we look at those now in Language Takeaway?

40
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,939
Language Takeaway All right, so the first word we have today is when something is no longer in use.

41
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:23,500
Okay, so this word is obsolete.

42
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:24,680
It's obsolete.

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Obsolete.

44
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:29,240
And we're not just talking about like, oh, I haven't touched that pen in like 10 years.

45
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:36,259
We're talking about a piece of technology that is no longer useful because there's something else that can do a better job.

46
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:36,759
Right.

47
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,780
And actually, not only with technology, we also have words that are obsolete, right?

48
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:42,500
Exactly.

49
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:44,819
Like, thy or thine.

50
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,780
You or yours.

51
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,000
Classical English.

52
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,479
We don't use thy anymore.

53
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,099
No.

54
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,280
Thou art very summery today, Marco.

55
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,599
We don't use that anymore.

56
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,240
That's obsolete English, right?

57
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,240
Or obsolete words.

58
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,060
Exactly.

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,620
So obsolete means it's no longer of use.

60
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,599
We have better and newer things in its place.

61
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:05,460
All right.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,039
And now moving on, when the salesman was describing the characteristics of the computer, he used some prefixes that were a little bit strange, right?

63
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:18,560
Like, for example, giga.

64
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,759
G-g-what?

65
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,360
G-g.

66
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:21,479
All right.

67
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,020
So these are actually prefixes that have to do with numbers.

68
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,159
And so this is not just a computer thing.

69
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:27,780
This is a math thing or science thing.

70
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,580
So, OK, so we've got three different prefixes.

71
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,800
A prefix is something we tack on at the beginning of a word.

72
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,780
So we have hertz or byte, right?

73
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,000
These are little bits of a computer byte.

74
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:39,460
Right.

75
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,520
So you have like megabytes.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,939
Megabytes we've all heard before.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,939
That's the smallest here.

78
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,620
We've got megabytes, but bigger than mega.

79
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,759
We've got gigabytes.

80
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,500
A giga.

81
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:47,840
Yeah.

82
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:52,860
So now, for example, the the hard drives are 250 gigabytes.

83
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,599
You might even hear someone say gigs.

84
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,520
You've got a 250 gig hard drive.

85
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,780
But what's bigger than giga?

86
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,620
Now it's the terabyte.

87
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:02,780
Ooh, tera.

88
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,099
It sounds like boom, boom, boom, boom.

89
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,139
Yeah, I actually wondered what would happen after gigabyte because it's so much information already.

90
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,479
And now it's the terabyte.

91
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:14,120
So it's like 1000 gigabytes.

92
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,220
So that's like 200 movies.

93
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,319
That's probably more than that.

94
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,620
It's amazing the amount of storage you can have and how small it actually is.

95
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:27,500
So mega, giga, tera, going from littlest to biggest.

96
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,300
All right.

97
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,899
And well, he described a four gigahertz processor.

98
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:37,540
OK, so the processor is our next word.

99
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,500
And this is actually something that that determines how fast your computer is going to run.

100
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,939
So it comes from the word to process, right?

101
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:44,459
Right.

102
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,319
To like calculate or to think.

103
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,160
To even.

104
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:47,920
To do.

105
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,879
So you have different examples like a word processor.

106
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:51,740
Right.

107
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,839
So it's like Microsoft Word.

108
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,160
It allows you to make word documents.

109
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,220
You can also say to process data.

110
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,579
You're trying to calculate it.

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,139
But in this case, a processor is like a little brain that's the center of the computer and that's where all the information gets processed.

112
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:07,519
Yeah.

113
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,360
So it's the brain of the computer, essentially.

114
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,480
And the bigger it is, the faster it can go.

115
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,180
Exactly.

116
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,399
And well, if you don't have a very good processor, your computer is bound to freeze.

117
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,220
OK, so freezing is another key word, especially when talking about computers.

118
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,319
This one drives me nuts.

119
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,699
To freeze, it means to stop moving.

120
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:29,540
Right.

121
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,720
So, well, it has a couple of different meanings.

122
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,019
You might have heard it about ice before, but to freeze here, we're talking about stopping moving.

123
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,860
So we have a game called Freeze Tag, where if I touch you, you have to stop running.

124
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,240
Right.

125
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,019
But here we're talking about a computer freezing.

126
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,500
I'm moving my mouse and I'm typing and all of a sudden my mouse doesn't move.

127
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,220
I can't close or open or do anything.

128
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,500
And it's really frustrating.

129
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,660
Especially if you're doing something and you didn't say your work, it's gone.

130
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:57,420
Right.

131
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:02,279
So if your computer freezes, then usually you have to restart it or turn it off or not.

132
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,160
So that is about it for those words.

133
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,939
But let's take another listen and slow the dialog down this time so we can catch some of those big words.

134
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,519
So can you fix it?

135
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,220
I'm sorry, sir.

136
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,480
This computer is not broken or damaged.

137
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,500
It's simply just too old.

138
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,660
That's why your programs and applications are running slow.

139
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,519
There really isn't much I can do.

140
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,540
What do you mean?

141
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,079
I bought this computer just three years ago.

142
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,459
Yes, but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster.

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,040
Okay, I know where this is going.

144
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,600
How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

145
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:46,660
Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.

146
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,079
It has a 4 gigahertz processor with 16 gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with 1 terabyte.

147
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,360
Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard and desk speakers.

148
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,180
I have no idea what you are talking about.

149
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,360
I just want to know if it's good and if I'll be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time.

150
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,160
This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze.

151
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,459
If it does, we'll give you your money back.

152
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,439
Great, so we are back.

153
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,660
So now let's jump into today's Fluency Builder.

154
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,879
All right, so on Fluency Builder, we're going to take a look at three different phrases.

155
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,319
For example, the salesman was describing technology and said that it's ever changing.

156
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,779
Okay, so this is a sort of poetic line here.

157
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,759
So ever changing means always changing.

158
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:37,800
Always changing.

159
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:40,259
And so we can say that the ocean is ever changing.

160
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,620
You know, the waves are always changing.

161
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,379
But in this case, he's saying that technology is always changing.

162
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,819
It's always progressing into something new.

163
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,420
And so that is a key selling point for this guy.

164
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,120
Right.

165
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,519
So this is actually a very interesting word.

166
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:01,860
We can use it like in your example, beyond technology, like the way, like the sea is ever changing.

167
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,560
So why don't we listen to a couple of other examples.

168
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:11,480
There's always something new in this ever changing world.

169
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,579
Times are ever changing and we must prepare ourselves better every day.

170
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,220
The flu is an ever changing virus that continues to claim many lives.

171
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,779
All right, we're back.

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,920
So now we understand the ever changing.

173
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:40,639
So the man who's trying to buy this computer, or at least get his computer fixed, really starts to get frustrated with the salesman.

174
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,000
And he says, okay, I know where this is going.

175
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,720
So he hears the sales pitch.

176
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,620
He hears this guy trying to loosen him up a little bit.

177
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,279
He says, I know where this is going.

178
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,539
So what does this mean?

179
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,519
This where something is going.

180
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,879
So basically, what direction a conversation or a topic or a situation is taking.

181
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,240
Okay, so he's saying, I know why you're telling me these things.

182
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:04,480
I know your motive.

183
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,000
Or I know what's happening.

184
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,440
I know what you're going to say.

185
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,419
Okay, so he's essentially saying, I know you're going to try and sell me a computer.

186
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:11,879
Right.

187
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,200
So you can use it in other circumstances, right?

188
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,500
For example, a relationship.

189
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:18,700
I don't know where this is going.

190
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,019
Right, what is going?

191
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,299
Classic breakup line.

192
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:24,200
I just don't think I know where this is going anymore.

193
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,960
So in reference to the relationship, right?

194
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,139
We don't know what's happening.

195
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,919
Are we serious?

196
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,340
Are we maybe going to get married?

197
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,220
I don't know anymore.

198
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,080
I can't tell where this movie is going.

199
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,340
It's so like, oh, here and there and boring.

200
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,440
You don't know the plot.

201
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:37,779
Yeah.

202
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:38,659
All right.

203
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,639
So it's a very common phrase.

204
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,919
And it sounds very natural when you say it, right?

205
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:43,259
It does.

206
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,919
And that's why Influency Builder really helps you sound like a more native English speaker when you use these kind of phrases.

207
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:51,460
And the next one is also very, very good.

208
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,759
When he describes the condition of the computer, he says it's top of the line.

209
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,539
Top of the line.

210
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,779
Now, what line we're talking about, I do not know.

211
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,840
Like, above average line.

212
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,259
Right.

213
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,419
So this is the best of the best.

214
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,460
This is the top model or the top computer.

215
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,440
And you can definitely imagine a car salesman using this.

216
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:11,940
Yeah.

217
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,419
Yes, this BMW is top line.

218
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,700
It's the best money can buy.

219
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,220
Yeah, that's another good one.

220
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,899
So basically, top of the line is the best of the best.

221
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,100
The above average, right?

222
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,279
More than above average.

223
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,960
It's really it's the best you can do.

224
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:29,019
And so the guy saying, listen, this is our best computer.

225
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,360
Really, you should buy it.

226
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
And obviously, top of the line usually costs a lot of money.

227
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,840
Yeah, it's usually for something that costs money, right?

228
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,440
For things.

229
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,039
You wouldn't really use it for a person, right?

230
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:40,879
He's top of the line.

231
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,139
No, no, no, no.

232
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:47,220
Top of the line, I think generally refers to electronics and cars or like motorcycles.

233
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,759
And so you often hear top of the line stereo, top of the line TV, top of the line car.

234
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,580
But you wouldn't say this about food or people or art.

235
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,159
Yeah, you wouldn't say this painting is top of the line.

236
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,620
No, not about like very unique things.

237
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,820
You'd say this about kind of manufactured things.

238
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:05,179
Very good.

239
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,539
So we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases.

240
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back.

241
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:20,899
So, can you fix it?

242
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,559
I'm sorry, sir.

243
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,799
This computer is not broken or damaged.

244
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,840
It's simply just too old.

245
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,980
That's why your programs and applications are running slow.

246
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,820
There really isn't much I can do.

247
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,860
What do you mean?

248
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,360
I bought this computer just three years ago.

249
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,980
Yes, but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster.

250
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,500
Okay, I know where this is going.

251
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,059
How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

252
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,139
Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.

253
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,519
It has a four gigahertz processor with 16 gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte.

254
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,820
Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard and desk speakers.

255
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,639
I have no idea what you are talking about.

256
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,820
I just want to know if it's good and if I'll be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time.

257
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,659
This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze.

258
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
If it does, we'll give you your money back.

259
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:23,259
All right, we're back.

260
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,559
So computers, Catherine, I know you recently got a nice Macintosh.

261
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,460
Yeah, I did.

262
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,860
It's one of those big screen ones, right?

263
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,399
Yeah, it is.

264
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,460
It's a desktop, so it's not a laptop.

265
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,620
And it's got a very fast processor because Max started using Intel processors a couple of years ago and that made them much faster.

266
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:47,740
Wow, and this processor actually has two cores, right?

267
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,559
So basically it has two different brains almost within one processor.

268
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,779
Which gives it really bad headaches.

269
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,639
She complains to me often.

270
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,759
Are you a big Mac fan or PC fan?

271
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,580
I'm a Mac fan.

272
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,820
I've been converted.

273
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,059
My roommate in college my sophomore year had a Mac and ever since then I've really gotten into them.

274
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:10,840
So I went Mac and didn't turn back.

275
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,600
I still honestly cannot really use a Mac.

276
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:15,539
I get confused.

277
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,840
I'm looking for the start button and I'm looking for where my documents are.

278
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,919
It's really hard to change over, right?

279
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,100
But once you do, you don't want to change back because everything is so much easier on a Mac.

280
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,419
But if you're really into PC gaming, then you should probably stick with it.

281
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,879
Stick with the PCs because the games just don't really compare on Macs.

282
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,879
But I've heard that also Macs don't really suffer from viruses, right?

283
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,360
No, they don't, which is great because I always used to get these viruses that would float on my computer.

284
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,019
Because, you know, you open some email and all of a sudden there's nastiness on your desktop.

285
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:54,879
Well, now I don't really have that problem and also there's really wonderful photo editing software and video editing software.

286
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,059
So everything is just really easy to find and easy to use.

287
00:13:58,659 --> 00:13:59,720
What about you, listeners?

288
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,299
Do you prefer the Mac?

289
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,559
Do you prefer the PC?

290
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,519
Or maybe some of our listeners don't really even like computers.

291
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,139
Well, let us know either way.

292
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,720
We're very curious to hear what you have to say.

293
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,840
And, of course, writing on our comment section is great practice for your English.

294
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,600
Right, so we'll see you guys there and until next time.

295
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,159
Bye, everyone.
