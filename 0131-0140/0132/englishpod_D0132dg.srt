00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:34,899
EnglishPod.com Mmm, doesn't look good.

2
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,799
What do you mean?

3
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,380
My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month.

4
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,000
It's brand new.

5
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,119
Well Missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator.

6
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,579
You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission.

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,219
You should have called us and we could have told you over here when your car died.

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,960
Ugh, so how long is this going to take?

9
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:56,899
An hour?

10
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,420
I'm afraid a bit more than that.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,100
We need to order the spare parts.

12
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,640
Take apart your electrical system, fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again.

13
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,760
You're going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,799
What?

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,140
How am I supposed to go to school or go shopping?

16
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,459
This is not happening.
