00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:34,000
EnglishPod.com Mmm, doesn't look good.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What do you mean?

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's brand new.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well Missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You should have called us and we could have told you over here when your car died.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Ugh, so how long is this going to take?

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
An hour?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm afraid a bit more than that.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We need to order the spare parts.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Take apart your electrical system, fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What?

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
How am I supposed to go to school or go shopping?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is not happening.
