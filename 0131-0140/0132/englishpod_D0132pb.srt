00:00:02,619 --> 00:00:05,160
Hello, English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,879
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,179
And my name is Katherine.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,160
And today we're talking about being on the road.

5
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:15,099
Yeah, we're going to be on the road, but we're going to encounter a little bit of car problems.

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,039
My favorite kind.

7
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:17,559
Oh, yeah.

8
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:18,739
I think it's happened to everyone.

9
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:23,940
You're on the road, or maybe you're coming back from work, you get a flat tire, or something happens to your car, right?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,620
And it's always when you're in a rush.

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,660
And most of the time it's raining.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,160
Yeah.

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,719
Or it's snowing.

14
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:34,100
So all of the circumstances, definitely, well, they don't help, let's just say.

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,960
All right, so before we listen to this dialogue, let's take a look at some of the words in today's vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:42,179
Vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,159
All right, so we're going to take a look at two words.

18
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:49,340
They're kind of strange, I don't know, kind of difficult to understand.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,340
So that's where we're going to explain them.

20
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:54,380
The first one is spew, to spew.

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,479
It's a verb, okay?

22
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,479
To spew.

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,380
Well, what can spew?

24
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,880
Volcano can spew.

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
An engine can spew.

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,399
A person can spew.

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,840
Yeah, that's not very nice.

28
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:09,000
So basically it's to expel, or to...

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,540
Shoot out.

30
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:13,079
Shoot out from your mouth or something liquid.

31
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:14,620
So in the case of a person, right?

32
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,579
So if a person spews, it means a person throws up, but it's usually very forceful, all right?

33
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,400
It's very messy.

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,920
A volcano can spew lava.

35
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:23,659
Exactly.

36
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,040
So a volcano is spewing lava.

37
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,500
Now for the next word that we have, it's an informal way of saying that something is broken.

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,000
You can say it's busted.

39
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:34,819
It's busted.

40
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,579
My DVD player is busted.

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,340
Man, my phone is busted.

42
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,939
So it's an informal way, very popular, very common, I would say, to describe that something is not working.

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,560
I don't think many people actually say, well, it's broken or it's damaged.

44
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,719
Yeah, they're pretty much mixed, I think, but you will definitely hear busted if you're talking to native English speakers.

45
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,359
Or even like, for example, your arm, oh, he's got a busted arm.

46
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,219
Exactly.

47
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,159
So busted.

48
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,599
All right, so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

49
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,259
Let's see what's going on with this car trouble, and then we'll come back and explain some things.

50
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,719
I don't know, this stupid old car started being white smoke and it just died on me.

51
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,460
Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here.

52
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
What do you think it is?

53
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,159
Not sure yet.

54
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,759
How about you pop the hood and we can take a look?

55
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,099
Mmm, doesn't look good.

56
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,139
What do you mean?

57
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,659
My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month.

58
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,280
It's brand new.

59
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:52,379
Well, Missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator.

60
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,860
You overheated your engine, so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission.

61
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,520
You should have called us and we could have told you over here when your car died.

62
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:04,219
Ugh, so how long is this going to take?

63
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:05,159
An hour?

64
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,719
I'm afraid a bit more than that.

65
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,919
We need to order the spare parts, take apart your electrical system, fuel pump, and engine, and then put it back together again.

66
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,020
You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.

67
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,080
What?

68
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,419
How am I supposed to go to school or go shopping?

69
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,860
This is not happening.

70
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:57,479
But definitely it's something that happens all the time and probably the mechanic will overcharge her as well because apparently she doesn't know what she's doing.

71
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,219
And that's one of the reasons we want to give you the vocabulary to deal with these situations.

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,800
So let's look at some of those car words in today's language takeaway.

73
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:15,139
Alright, so we're going to take a look at very specific words related to cars and the engines and everything.

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,300
So let's start with the first one.

75
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,240
Radiator.

76
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,259
Alright, so the radiator of the car.

77
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,779
So a radiator is something that you normally find in the front of the car near the engine.

78
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,259
It usually gets very, very hot, right?

79
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,620
So one of the big issues is radiators getting too hot because there's no way to cool them down.

80
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,259
So if you live in a place that's very hot, the radiator keeps your engine cool because it has water in it.

81
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:47,839
So if it overheats or maybe you didn't put enough water in there, then it'll start spewing steam like in this dialogue.

82
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:53,160
And if you have a problem with your radiator, you could actually do a lot of damage to your engine, which is why this is important.

83
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,180
Exactly, and that's what happened in this dialogue.

84
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,819
So a radiator.

85
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,560
Now because the radiator wasn't working well, it overheated the engine and he said they had some busted pistons.

86
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:04,980
So broken pistons.

87
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,879
Pistons are important because they're kind of like valves that go up and down.

88
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,639
Right, so inside your engine you have mini explosions and the pistons move up and down and that's what actually moves your car.

89
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:26,420
Right, and so pistons in general are things in mechanics, so like a trumpet has pistons, things that go up and down and that allow for the flow of air.

90
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,420
Air or something like that.

91
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:27,939
Very good.

92
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,259
So that's a piston.

93
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,860
And, well, another very common mechanic term is the transmission.

94
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,839
Alright, so the transmission, what happens if your transmission dies?

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,879
Can you still drive?

96
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:43,079
You basically can't move or maybe you only have one gear or two gears.

97
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,259
Alright, so think about transmission as coming from the word to transmit.

98
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:47,480
That means to transfer.

99
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:54,500
So this is the part of the car that transfers energy or the power to actually move the car.

100
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,319
So the transmission.

101
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:01,740
And we've got the mechanic who says, well, we've got to order you some spare parts.

102
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,920
So first let's look at the word spare.

103
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,399
What's another word for spare?

104
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,779
Additional, maybe extra.

105
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,240
Right, so spare means extra.

106
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,040
Parts are, well, pieces.

107
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:18,600
So he's talking about ordering a new transmission, new pistons, things to replace the broken things.

108
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,759
Spare parts.

109
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,240
So this is where you go to the mechanic to get some spare parts and get them installed.

110
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,720
You probably don't have many spare parts at home, right?

111
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,639
You've got a transmission lying around.

112
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,079
Well, yeah, so spare parts.

113
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,819
And the last word that we're going to take a look at is a fuel pump.

114
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:39,860
Okay, so a pump is, you could have a bike pump.

115
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,839
A water pump.

116
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,480
Water pump.

117
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,939
So these are some things that we use very, very often, but a fuel pump is something that allows gas, gasoline, to get into your engine.

118
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,959
So it's basically a device that pushes gasoline into the engine so you can start.

119
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,920
And that's the same thing with a water pump.

120
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,779
It's a device that pushes water.

121
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,379
Or an air pump is something that pushes air into your tires and your bicycle.

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:02,980
Exactly.

123
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:06,040
So a fuel pump, water pump, et cetera.

124
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,779
Wow, I feel like we know a lot about cars.

125
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:08,939
Apparently we do.

126
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:18,040
All right, so now that we've taken a look at all of these great words, let's move on to a couple of phrases in Fluency Builder.

127
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,379
Fluency Builder.

128
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:30,240
All right, these are phrases that you hear sometimes when you're talking about electronics, but in today's lesson, we're also talking about specific car phrases, so you're going to hear these all the time at the mechanics.

129
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,899
Right, and the first one is, the car suddenly died on me.

130
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:37,439
All right, to die on.

131
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,860
So we keep these two words together, die on.

132
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,920
Oh man, so while you were driving, your car died.

133
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,860
It stopped moving.

134
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,019
So that means that it doesn't work anymore.

135
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,680
And it's not only for cars, right?

136
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,639
You can say my MP3 player died on me today.

137
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:54,360
Exactly.

138
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,399
And what it means is it's not like you left it and you forgot about it and you tried it again and it didn't work.

139
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,699
It means while you're using it, it dies.

140
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,399
It doesn't work.

141
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,500
So I think this phrase is a good one to give some other examples, so let's listen.

142
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,240
Example one.

143
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,019
My CD player died on me and I had to listen to the radio.

144
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,899
Example two.

145
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,560
Get that medicine over here faster.

146
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,339
This guy's going to die on me.

147
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,199
Example three.

148
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,740
I forgot to charge my mobile phone.

149
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,639
It's going to die on me soon.

150
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,120
And so this next one is a phrase you hear, the first thing you hear maybe, when you tell someone you have a car problem.

151
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,179
Right, you tell them to pop the hood.

152
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,899
Or let's pop the hood.

153
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,980
So this means let's open the front part of the car, the hood, to look at the engine, transmission, all those parts.

154
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,659
Exactly.

155
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,519
So you can say open the hood, but the most common one is pop the hood.

156
00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:03,700
So the reason is because there is a little spring and you have to pull inside the car and it goes pop, and there's a little jump.

157
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,320
So it's literally popping.

158
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,740
Or you can also say the trunk, the back part of the car.

159
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,259
Hey, can you pop the trunk for me?

160
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:12,759
I've got to put some stuff inside.

161
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:13,320
Exactly.

162
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,200
So pop the hood, pop the trunk.

163
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,639
And next we've got this girl actually who's talking about her car because she just got this car.

164
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,299
So what's another way to say it's a new car?

165
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,879
It's brand new.

166
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:26,360
Is that more new than new?

167
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,320
It's like newer, newer than new.

168
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,059
Alright, so brand, you think about brands like Ford or Gucci.

169
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:33,779
These are brands.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,480
But brand new means she maybe got it like today.

171
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,399
So it's brand new.

172
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:40,779
It's very, very new.

173
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,379
Did you see my brand new watch?

174
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:43,919
Oh, it is nice.

175
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,659
Where'd you get it?

176
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,740
Alright, so brand new.

177
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,720
And well, the last phrase that we have for you today is to take apart something.

178
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,000
Alright, so this is very popular with young children.

179
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,899
Like they like to take things apart so they can find out how they work.

180
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:00,440
But to take apart means to take all the pieces and to pull them out.

181
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,879
Yeah, I used to do that a lot when I was a kid.

182
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:10,139
I used to take apart any electronic device to kind of see how it works and then I would try to put it back together again.

183
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,360
That's why you're so smart.

184
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,039
Well, it never really worked.

185
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,120
It worked half the time.

186
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,139
So the problem is always putting them back together again, right?

187
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:17,539
Exactly.

188
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:24,860
So you can take it apart but then you put it back together and there's always a screw missing or a screw that's extra or two or three parts.

189
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,340
Not a good sign.

190
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,039
Alright, so we've taken a look at a lot of great words and phrases.

191
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:33,450
So let's listen to this dialogue for the last time.

192
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,220
Howdy.

193
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,240
Nice car.

194
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,940
What seems to be the problem?

195
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,299
I don't know.

196
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:53,200
This stupid old car started being white smoke and it just died on me.

197
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,960
Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here.

198
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,559
What do you think it is?

199
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:58,600
Not sure yet.

200
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,179
How about you pop the hood and we can take a look.

201
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,539
Doesn't look good.

202
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:08,600
What do you mean?

203
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,139
My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month.

204
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,759
It's brand new.

205
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:16,860
Well, missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator.

206
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,320
You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission.

207
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,000
You should have called us and we could have told you over here when your car died.

208
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,700
So how long is this going to take?

209
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,639
An hour?

210
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,179
I'm afraid a bit more than that.

211
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:39,399
We need to order the spare parts, take apart your electrical system, fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again.

212
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,519
You're going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.

213
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:43,559
What?

214
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,879
How am I supposed to go to school or go shopping?

215
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,200
This is not happening.

216
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
All right, so car trouble.

217
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:03,220
Have you ever had like any very serious car trouble or like something weird happen to your car?

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,759
Actually, the week before I decided to leave Chicago, I had this 1991 Honda Civic hatchback.

219
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,799
So only two doors.

220
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,360
Nice.

221
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:21,200
And I was driving home from work, I was on the highway, had the radio on, the windows open and then it died.

222
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,500
It died in the middle of the highway during rush hour, right?

223
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,659
So that's when there's tons of cars and I didn't know what to do.

224
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,700
So I'm calling people and then all of a sudden I see someone tapping on my window and there's cars everywhere.

225
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,940
And it's this guy and he's like, listen, do you need a hand?

226
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:37,519
I said, yes.

227
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,960
So I put the car in neutral so that there's no break.

228
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,320
And he pushed it to a side road and gave me a ride home.

229
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:45,840
No way.

230
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,039
He was the coolest guy.

231
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,919
He was so nice.

232
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:50,960
And he was just there with his truck.

233
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,100
He's a gardener and just gave me a ride home.

234
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,480
It was super, super cool.

235
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,840
And so it turns out my engine died.

236
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,340
No, the engine was new.

237
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,980
It was the transmission.

238
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:00,600
It was shot.

239
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:01,860
It was totally broken.

240
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,039
But I was very lucky to have such a kind person.

241
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:17,720
Yeah, that's a good story because usually people are too afraid or maybe a little bit reluctant to stop and see if you're okay or if you need a ride or something because you can't really trust people these days.

242
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,259
But it's good.

243
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,600
Once I saw somebody on the side of the road.

244
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,460
It had a flat tire.

245
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,340
It was two girls and they didn't know what to do.

246
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,500
So I was passing by.

247
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,960
It was actually raining.

248
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,960
And I was like, hey, do you guys need a hand?

249
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,200
And they're like, yeah, please, man.

250
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,120
We can't locate my dad or whatever.

251
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,639
So I was changing the tire.

252
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,559
It's not a big deal, right?

253
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,759
And they wanted to tip me.

254
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:38,840
They wanted to give me some money.

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,019
They're like, oh, please say this.

256
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,740
You're so kind.

257
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,000
You're time and you're all wet.

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,500
And I'm like, no, no, don't worry about it.

259
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,720
No, it's just a nice thing to do.

260
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,559
If you know anything about cars, I mean, or if you can offer someone a lift.

261
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,539
I know it's not terribly safe to ride with strangers, but this guy totally helped me out.

262
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,120
Nice.

263
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:54,980
All right.

264
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:01,519
Well, maybe you guys have some cool or maybe some interesting stories of what's happened with your cars or maybe you've helped somebody out.
