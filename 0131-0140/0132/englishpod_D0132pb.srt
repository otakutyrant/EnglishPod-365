00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And my name is Katherine.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're talking about being on the road.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah, we're going to be on the road, but we're going to encounter a little bit of car problems.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My favorite kind.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, yeah.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I think it's happened to everyone.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're on the road, or maybe you're coming back from work, you get a flat tire, or something happens to your car, right?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And it's always when you're in a rush.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And most of the time it's raining.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Or it's snowing.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So all of the circumstances, definitely, well, they don't help, let's just say.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
All right, so before we listen to this dialogue, let's take a look at some of the words in today's vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All right, so we're going to take a look at two words.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
They're kind of strange, I don't know, kind of difficult to understand.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So that's where we're going to explain them.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The first one is spew, to spew.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's a verb, okay?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
To spew.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, what can spew?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Volcano can spew.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
An engine can spew.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
A person can spew.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, that's not very nice.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So basically it's to expel, or to...

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Shoot out.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Shoot out from your mouth or something liquid.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So in the case of a person, right?

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So if a person spews, it means a person throws up, but it's usually very forceful, all right?

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's very messy.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A volcano can spew lava.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Exactly.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So a volcano is spewing lava.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now for the next word that we have, it's an informal way of saying that something is broken.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can say it's busted.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's busted.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
My DVD player is busted.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Man, my phone is busted.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So it's an informal way, very popular, very common, I would say, to describe that something is not working.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't think many people actually say, well, it's broken or it's damaged.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, they're pretty much mixed, I think, but you will definitely hear busted if you're talking to native English speakers.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Or even like, for example, your arm, oh, he's got a busted arm.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Exactly.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So busted.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All right, so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's see what's going on with this car trouble, and then we'll come back and explain some things.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't know, this stupid old car started being white smoke and it just died on me.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What do you think it is?

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Not sure yet.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How about you pop the hood and we can take a look?

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Mmm, doesn't look good.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you mean?

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's brand new.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, Missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You overheated your engine, so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You should have called us and we could have told you over here when your car died.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Ugh, so how long is this going to take?

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
An hour?

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm afraid a bit more than that.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We need to order the spare parts, take apart your electrical system, fuel pump, and engine, and then put it back together again.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What?

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How am I supposed to go to school or go shopping?

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is not happening.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But definitely it's something that happens all the time and probably the mechanic will overcharge her as well because apparently she doesn't know what she's doing.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And that's one of the reasons we want to give you the vocabulary to deal with these situations.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So let's look at some of those car words in today's language takeaway.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Alright, so we're going to take a look at very specific words related to cars and the engines and everything.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So let's start with the first one.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Radiator.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Alright, so the radiator of the car.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So a radiator is something that you normally find in the front of the car near the engine.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It usually gets very, very hot, right?

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So one of the big issues is radiators getting too hot because there's no way to cool them down.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So if you live in a place that's very hot, the radiator keeps your engine cool because it has water in it.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So if it overheats or maybe you didn't put enough water in there, then it'll start spewing steam like in this dialogue.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And if you have a problem with your radiator, you could actually do a lot of damage to your engine, which is why this is important.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Exactly, and that's what happened in this dialogue.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So a radiator.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now because the radiator wasn't working well, it overheated the engine and he said they had some busted pistons.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So broken pistons.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Pistons are important because they're kind of like valves that go up and down.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Right, so inside your engine you have mini explosions and the pistons move up and down and that's what actually moves your car.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Right, and so pistons in general are things in mechanics, so like a trumpet has pistons, things that go up and down and that allow for the flow of air.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Air or something like that.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Very good.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So that's a piston.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And, well, another very common mechanic term is the transmission.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Alright, so the transmission, what happens if your transmission dies?

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Can you still drive?

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You basically can't move or maybe you only have one gear or two gears.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Alright, so think about transmission as coming from the word to transmit.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That means to transfer.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So this is the part of the car that transfers energy or the power to actually move the car.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So the transmission.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And we've got the mechanic who says, well, we've got to order you some spare parts.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So first let's look at the word spare.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What's another word for spare?

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Additional, maybe extra.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Right, so spare means extra.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Parts are, well, pieces.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So he's talking about ordering a new transmission, new pistons, things to replace the broken things.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Spare parts.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So this is where you go to the mechanic to get some spare parts and get them installed.

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You probably don't have many spare parts at home, right?

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You've got a transmission lying around.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, yeah, so spare parts.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And the last word that we're going to take a look at is a fuel pump.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay, so a pump is, you could have a bike pump.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A water pump.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Water pump.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So these are some things that we use very, very often, but a fuel pump is something that allows gas, gasoline, to get into your engine.

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So it's basically a device that pushes gasoline into the engine so you can start.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And that's the same thing with a water pump.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's a device that pushes water.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Or an air pump is something that pushes air into your tires and your bicycle.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Exactly.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So a fuel pump, water pump, et cetera.

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Wow, I feel like we know a lot about cars.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Apparently we do.

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
All right, so now that we've taken a look at all of these great words, let's move on to a couple of phrases in Fluency Builder.

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Fluency Builder.

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:30,000
All right, these are phrases that you hear sometimes when you're talking about electronics, but in today's lesson, we're also talking about specific car phrases, so you're going to hear these all the time at the mechanics.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Right, and the first one is, the car suddenly died on me.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
All right, to die on.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So we keep these two words together, die on.

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh man, so while you were driving, your car died.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It stopped moving.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So that means that it doesn't work anymore.

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And it's not only for cars, right?

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You can say my MP3 player died on me today.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Exactly.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And what it means is it's not like you left it and you forgot about it and you tried it again and it didn't work.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It means while you're using it, it dies.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It doesn't work.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So I think this phrase is a good one to give some other examples, so let's listen.

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Example one.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
My CD player died on me and I had to listen to the radio.

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Example two.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Get that medicine over here faster.

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This guy's going to die on me.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Example three.

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I forgot to charge my mobile phone.

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's going to die on me soon.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And so this next one is a phrase you hear, the first thing you hear maybe, when you tell someone you have a car problem.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Right, you tell them to pop the hood.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Or let's pop the hood.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So this means let's open the front part of the car, the hood, to look at the engine, transmission, all those parts.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Exactly.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So you can say open the hood, but the most common one is pop the hood.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So the reason is because there is a little spring and you have to pull inside the car and it goes pop, and there's a little jump.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So it's literally popping.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Or you can also say the trunk, the back part of the car.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hey, can you pop the trunk for me?

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I've got to put some stuff inside.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Exactly.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So pop the hood, pop the trunk.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And next we've got this girl actually who's talking about her car because she just got this car.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So what's another way to say it's a new car?

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's brand new.

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Is that more new than new?

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's like newer, newer than new.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Alright, so brand, you think about brands like Ford or Gucci.

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
These are brands.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But brand new means she maybe got it like today.

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So it's brand new.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's very, very new.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Did you see my brand new watch?

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, it is nice.

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Where'd you get it?

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Alright, so brand new.

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And well, the last phrase that we have for you today is to take apart something.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Alright, so this is very popular with young children.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Like they like to take things apart so they can find out how they work.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But to take apart means to take all the pieces and to pull them out.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, I used to do that a lot when I was a kid.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I used to take apart any electronic device to kind of see how it works and then I would try to put it back together again.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's why you're so smart.

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, it never really worked.

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It worked half the time.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So the problem is always putting them back together again, right?

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Exactly.

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So you can take it apart but then you put it back together and there's always a screw missing or a screw that's extra or two or three parts.

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Not a good sign.

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Alright, so we've taken a look at a lot of great words and phrases.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So let's listen to this dialogue for the last time.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Howdy.

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Nice car.

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What seems to be the problem?

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't know.

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This stupid old car started being white smoke and it just died on me.

197
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here.

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What do you think it is?

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Not sure yet.

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
How about you pop the hood and we can take a look.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Doesn't look good.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What do you mean?

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month.

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's brand new.

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator.

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission.

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You should have called us and we could have told you over here when your car died.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So how long is this going to take?

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
An hour?

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm afraid a bit more than that.

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We need to order the spare parts, take apart your electrical system, fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again.

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What?

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
How am I supposed to go to school or go shopping?

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This is not happening.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
All right, so car trouble.

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Have you ever had like any very serious car trouble or like something weird happen to your car?

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Actually, the week before I decided to leave Chicago, I had this 1991 Honda Civic hatchback.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So only two doors.

220
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Nice.

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I was driving home from work, I was on the highway, had the radio on, the windows open and then it died.

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It died in the middle of the highway during rush hour, right?

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So that's when there's tons of cars and I didn't know what to do.

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So I'm calling people and then all of a sudden I see someone tapping on my window and there's cars everywhere.

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it's this guy and he's like, listen, do you need a hand?

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I said, yes.

227
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So I put the car in neutral so that there's no break.

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And he pushed it to a side road and gave me a ride home.

229
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No way.

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
He was the coolest guy.

231
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,000
He was so nice.

232
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And he was just there with his truck.

233
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He's a gardener and just gave me a ride home.

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It was super, super cool.

235
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And so it turns out my engine died.

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No, the engine was new.

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It was the transmission.

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was shot.

239
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It was totally broken.

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But I was very lucky to have such a kind person.

241
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, that's a good story because usually people are too afraid or maybe a little bit reluctant to stop and see if you're okay or if you need a ride or something because you can't really trust people these days.

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But it's good.

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Once I saw somebody on the side of the road.

244
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It had a flat tire.

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It was two girls and they didn't know what to do.

246
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So I was passing by.

247
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It was actually raining.

248
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And I was like, hey, do you guys need a hand?

249
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And they're like, yeah, please, man.

250
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We can't locate my dad or whatever.

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So I was changing the tire.

252
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's not a big deal, right?

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And they wanted to tip me.

254
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They wanted to give me some money.

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
They're like, oh, please say this.

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You're so kind.

257
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're time and you're all wet.

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I'm like, no, no, don't worry about it.

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No, it's just a nice thing to do.

260
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If you know anything about cars, I mean, or if you can offer someone a lift.

261
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I know it's not terribly safe to ride with strangers, but this guy totally helped me out.

262
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Nice.

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000
All right.

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, maybe you guys have some cool or maybe some interesting stories of what's happened with your cars or maybe you've helped somebody out.
