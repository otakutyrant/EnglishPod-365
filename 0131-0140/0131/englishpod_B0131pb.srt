00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:07,120
Hello, English learners, welcome back to another great lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,839
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,179
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,240
So, Marco, today we've got a little bit of an unusual lesson because we're talking about hypothetical situations.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,219
Right, we're talking about a unreal situation or something that may happen or may not happen.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,620
Okay, so you're going to hear all about this in today's dialogue.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,800
We're going to hear it a couple of times.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:34,240
When we come back, we'll be breaking it down for you, so you know all about these great phrases and how to talk about not real situations with your friends.

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,200
Okay, next question.

10
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,000
If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say?

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,020
Duh, I would say yes.

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,340
Eric is the most popular kid in school.

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,880
Okay, my turn.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,020
What would you do if you won the lottery?

15
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,420
Let's see.

16
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:01,340
If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,920
If you buy me a ticket, I'll go with you for sure.

18
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,560
My dad would freak out if I even mentioned a trip like that.

19
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,340
All right, this is a good one.

20
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:14,840
What would your mom say if you told her that you're going to get married?

21
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,340
If I told her that, she would faint and have me committed.

22
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:34,159
All right, so I think that was clear and, well, a very common situation, two teenage girls talking to each other about, you know, boys and what would you do and da-da-da.

23
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:37,540
Guys do this too, so don't just put this on the girls, okay?

24
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,379
I don't think we do it like this though.

25
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,659
No, but it's actually a very popular game in the car to play, the what-if game.

26
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,920
The what-if game, exactly.

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,260
And that's exactly the topic that we want to talk about today is the structure what-if, which is actually called a conditional.

28
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,459
All right, so conditional because the result, the thing that happens, depends on something else.

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,079
Exactly.

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,780
So let's actually take a look at the words in today's language takeaway before we talk about all this grammar stuff.

31
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,700
Language takeaway.

32
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,719
Okay, so we'll start out with some basic words.

33
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:18,000
Well, you know, they were talking about guys, and she said, if Eric asked you out, right?

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,780
So to ask somebody out.

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,439
Okay, so this might be a little bit strange because you think, okay, to ask is to ask a question, but to ask out, it's a fixed phrase.

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,939
It's something you say, these two words go together, right?

37
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:35,560
So I want to ask someone out, that means I want to invite someone on a date.

38
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,000
On a romantic date, usually.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,360
So yeah, I want to ask him out to dinner, or he asked me out to the movies.

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,120
Now if I didn't want to ask somebody out on a romantic date, what verb would you use?

41
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:57,699
I'd say you could invite someone out, but then again, it's always a little bit, well, you can say invite for someone if you're going to ask them on a date too.

42
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:03,680
So I'd say to ask out is always romantic, and to invite can be romantic or just friends.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,240
Okay, so to ask somebody out.

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:14,379
Now they were talking about other situations, maybe they would go on a trip or something, and she said my dad would freak out.

45
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,259
This is a great phrase, this is something that I used a lot when I was a teenager.

46
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,199
The word freak out?

47
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:31,979
Freak out, so the verb to freak out means to be really angry or upset or, you know, it could be a good thing or a bad thing, but usually when we're talking about our parents, it's a bad thing.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,620
It's a bad thing.

49
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,680
So they get angry, they start yelling at you.

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,020
Yeah, so freak out means like overreact.

51
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,020
All right.

52
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,780
And the last word that we have a language takeaway today is committed.

53
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,900
Well, let's look at the whole phrase, he says, she would have me committed.

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,199
So this is actually being done to someone.

55
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:58,400
Now we did look at this word before, but basically for marriage, right, to commit to somebody to promise.

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, but to have someone committed means that you're going to send them away to maybe a mental institution.

57
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:15,000
So this means they have psychological problems, and someone else sends them to the hospital because they can't send themselves.

58
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,720
So it's always used to have someone committed, right?

59
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,839
Right, because it's being done to them.

60
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,319
They don't want it to happen.

61
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,439
It's involuntary.

62
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,379
Okay.

63
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,019
So she had him committed.

64
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,439
My mom's going to have me committed if I keep working 20 hours a day.

65
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:33,519
Exactly.

66
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,920
So that's the way you use it.

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,839
And so now you have another way of using this verb.

68
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,300
But now I think we should listen to this dialogue again.

69
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,899
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

70
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,959
And then we'll come back and look at this grammar focus that we want to talk about.

71
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,779
Okay, next question.

72
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:56,819
If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say?

73
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:59,439
Duh, I would say yes.

74
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,699
Eric is the most popular kid in school.

75
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,899
Okay, my turn.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,579
What would you do if you won the lottery?

77
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:10,360
Let's see.

78
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:16,620
If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world.

79
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:20,779
If you buy me a ticket, I will go with you for sure.

80
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,360
My dad would freak out if I even mention a trip like that.

81
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,980
All right, this is a good one.

82
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,920
What would your mom say if you told her you were going to get married?

83
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,199
If I told her that she would faint and have me committed.

84
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,300
All right, so we understood all the vocab now.

85
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,019
Now let's take a look at these unreal situations and what we were saying the what if game.

86
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,300
Right, so I think it's important to push these into two different categories, right?

87
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:58,680
We have one kind where it's very unrealistic.

88
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,620
It's probably not going to happen, that kind of situation.

89
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:07,720
And the other one is a situation that could very well happen, something that's probably very common.

90
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:13,680
Okay, so the first one we're going to talk about is very unrealistic situations, things that probably won't happen.

91
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,779
Okay, so let's take a look at an example that we found in the dialogue.

92
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:24,920
The most common one, and I think everybody gets asked this question, is if you won the lottery, what would you do?

93
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,079
Okay, if you won the lottery.

94
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:30,000
So this is a situation that's very uncommon, right?

95
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,399
Not many people win the lottery.

96
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,620
So we have to say, if you won the lottery, we use this verb in the past tense.

97
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:42,040
If you won the lottery, if this happened, what would you do?

98
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,319
So, Catherine, if you won the lottery, what would you do?

99
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:51,079
If I won the lottery, I would buy a boat and sail around the world with my friends.

100
00:06:52,220 --> 00:07:04,160
All right, so another example, again, using the same structure, right, the verb in the simple past tense, we would say, if you were stuck on an island with one other person, who would that be?

101
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:10,699
All right, so if you were stuck on a desert island with one person, who would that person be?

102
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,000
So, Marco, I'm going to ask you, who would it be?

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,279
I think it would be an engineer or a scientist that could probably get me off the island.

104
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:19,360
What about your girlfriend?

105
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,899
No, well, you know, that's the point, if I can get to her quicker.

106
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,180
Okay, I would say maybe kind of romantic, okay, kind of not.

107
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,600
So that's the first situation.

108
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,860
We've got these situations like being stuck on an island, winning the lottery, these are very unlikely.

109
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,540
But what about the other kind?

110
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:47,800
But before we move on to that, you notice that we use the verb was, we didn't say if I was on an island, I said if I were, right, or if you were.

111
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:55,800
So this is the way that you use it in these conditionals, if I were you, or if you were president of the United States.

112
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,199
This is a rule.

113
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,300
So this is a grammar rule.

114
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,160
We're not going to describe why it happens, because it's very, very complicated, and you can look it up on our site.

115
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,579
But we're going to describe how to use it.

116
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:06,420
That's the most important.

117
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,420
So we can say, for example, Marco, if I were you, I would dye my hair red.

118
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,399
Why?

119
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:13,939
I don't know.

120
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:14,779
I think it would look cool.

121
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,079
I don't think so.

122
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,740
So if I were you, I would.

123
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,459
Or if you were me, what would you do?

124
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,579
Exactly.

125
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,519
So we always use it like this, right?

126
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,740
If you're going to use this conditional, always use were for the subject, never was.

127
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:30,360
Right.

128
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,079
So you can tell.

129
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,960
This is a very, very big grammar issue.

130
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,940
A lot of English speakers make this mistake.

131
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:36,919
Very many.

132
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:41,340
But now you know that you shouldn't make this mistake, and you can speak properly.

133
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,019
All right.

134
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:50,659
So now that we've seen these semi-unreal situations, let's move on to something that's a little bit more probable, that it may happen.

135
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,360
Right.

136
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:55,639
So we've got these situations that are common or likely.

137
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,360
For example, in this lesson we hear, I will go with you for sure.

138
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,519
So this is, if you buy me a ticket to travel, of course I will go with you.

139
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,179
So if you buy, this is in the present tense, if you buy, then I will.

140
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:10,919
Right.

141
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,340
Right.

142
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,139
So now you notice a difference.

143
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,360
The verb is in the present, and then we use, instead of would, we use will.

144
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,919
So again, I can say, if it rains tomorrow, I will stay home and watch TV all day.

145
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:25,740
Okay.

146
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,120
So think about this.

147
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,860
Before we talked about going to desert islands.

148
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,919
Now we're talking about rain and the weather.

149
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,500
They're very, very different.

150
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,500
The rain is, you know, it's very common.

151
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,559
So we can say, if it rains tomorrow, I will need an umbrella.

152
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,799
What about this?

153
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:42,940
If we have lunch tomorrow, what will we eat?

154
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:43,960
Okay.

155
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,200
So we have lunch pretty much every day, right?

156
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,220
Yeah, pretty much.

157
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,580
So again, it's a situation that is very probable.

158
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:57,220
So if we have lunch tomorrow, we will probably eat, I don't know, pasta, I think.

159
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm feeling like pasta.

160
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:58,700
Pasta.

161
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,419
Noodles.

162
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,399
All right.

163
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:09,159
So Marco, let's take another listen to some of these phrases and try and figure out while you're listening, which kind of conditional it is, first or the second.

164
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:10,899
Example one.

165
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,220
If it's sunny today, we will go to the park.

166
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,399
Example two.

167
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,539
I would get a divorce if I were you.

168
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:22,899
Example three.

169
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,980
Mary will be very sad if Joe leaves.

170
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,840
Example four.

171
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:34,600
We wouldn't be so late if Nick drove faster.

172
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,179
Very good.

173
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,759
So we heard different examples.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,220
And the first conditional is the one that we mentioned is very probable.

175
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,820
And the second conditional is the one that's not so probable.

176
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,519
So they're very easy to distinguish.

177
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,259
You don't really need to know the names.

178
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,019
Just know how to use them, right?

179
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:52,720
Exactly.

180
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,440
And so just remember, if you were me, what would you do?

181
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,519
We've got these kind of pairs, these words that go together.

182
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,139
And the other one is more common.

183
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:05,659
If we if it rains tomorrow, I will bring an umbrella.

184
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,799
Perfect.

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,159
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time, just to kind of reinforce everything.

186
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:14,360
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

187
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:22,519
Okay, next question.

188
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,299
If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say?

189
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,320
Duh, I would say yes.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,639
Eric is the most popular kid in school.

191
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,179
Okay, my turn.

192
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,259
What would you do if you won the lottery?

193
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,820
Let's see.

194
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,639
If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for trips around the world.

195
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
If you buy me a ticket, I'll go with you for sure.

196
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,879
My dad would freak out if I even mention a trip like that.

197
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,620
All right, this is a good one.

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,159
What would your mom say if you told her that you're going to get married?

199
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,659
If I told her that, she would faint and have me committed.

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,320
So Marco, if we talk any more about grammar, someone's gonna have to have me committed.

201
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:17,019
It is a little bit difficult to talk about grammar, especially on a podcast, because it's such a difficult topic and it's also kind of heavy, right?

202
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:18,740
It is, but I'll tell you this.

203
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,220
These are very, very common phrases.

204
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:23,259
People use these all the time.

205
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,659
We talk in hypotheticals very often.

206
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:34,820
If you're asking for advice, for example, or if you're just playing a game in the car, you're gonna encounter these and it's very important to be able to know how to use them.

207
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,179
So and this is what we want to see now.
