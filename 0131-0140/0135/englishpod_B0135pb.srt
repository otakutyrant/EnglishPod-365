00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name is Catherine.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today, Marco, what are we talking about?

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, today we are not really in the best mood.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What do you mean?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're kind of sad.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're kind of nervous.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're not feeling very well.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah, it's a cloudy day.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Maybe that's why.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The blues.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The blues.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, yeah, that's what we're talking about today.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We're going to have a lot of different descriptive words to express, maybe feeling sad or maybe you're angry or you're nervous or something like that.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
OK, well, this is a very useful lesson.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hopefully, you're not feeling this way.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But if you have to talk about someone who is, I've got lots of words for you.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But first, we're going to preview a couple in today's vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Vocabulary preview.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
All right.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So today on vocabulary preview, we're going to look at two words.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And the first one is a way of saying that you feel sad.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So basically, I'm feeling down.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
OK, down.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You might have heard this before because it's the opposite of the word up.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Exactly.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So you're not feeling up happy, looking up.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're feeling down.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is another word for sad like Marco said.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Or you can also say, I'm a bit down today, right?

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, I'm a bit down today.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Or, you look really down.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Are you OK?

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, so you look sad.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Is everything OK?

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So down.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So now another feeling or a way that a person is feeling, maybe that person is grouchy.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Would you please stop talking so loud, Marco?

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I think you have...

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, seriously.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't be grouchy, Catherine.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Geez.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No, so grouchy is a way someone acts, usually when they're in a bad mood.

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Right.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So it's not like really angry.

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're not angry, but you're not very happy either.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're not very nice to people.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So there's a very famous TV character called Oscar the Grouch on Sesame Street.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Look for him on YouTube or Youku.

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And he's very, very good for learning about this feeling grouchy because he's a grouchy guy.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, he's always angry or never happy, basically.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Right.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He's always complaining about something.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So that word again is grouchy.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
All right.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So after taking a look at these two words, we're ready now to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's see what this dialogue is about, if maybe they're grouchy or maybe just sad.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Fine.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
OK, I'll talk to you later.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Bye.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Carrie, are you OK?

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You seem a bit down.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's so hard to talk to him at times.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something.

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He does have a pretty nerve-wracking job, you know.

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I tried to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day, but he always shuts down and brushes me off.

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Men are like that, you know.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I guess you're right.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What do you think I should do?

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He wasn't always as grouchy, you know.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he's down.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You are something else, you know that.

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All right, so two girls talking about guys.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I guess guys have a bad temper sometimes, right?

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I think anyone can have a bad temper.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But we're talking today about one of the boyfriend of one of these girls who has a very bad temper and has been very grouchy recently.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And that's why she's feeling a bit down.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So let's take a look at those words now in Language Takeaway.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
All right, so in today's Language Takeaway, we've got some wonderful words for you, words that are very good for describing stress or having anxiety.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And the first of these words is something you hear all the time, especially with young people.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Right.

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Somebody is stressed out.

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
My gosh, Marco, I'm so stressed out.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I have 10 homework assignments to do and softball practice.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And my mom wants me to help cook dinner tonight.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, you really are stressed out.

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I am.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't have any homework and I don't live with my mom.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But being stressed out is usually something you feel when you have too much stuff to do.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So maybe you can be stressed out because of school, like in your case, or maybe at work you have a lot of things to do or a project to finish, right?

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Exactly.

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And I just want to point out here that you can say I'm stressed or I'm feeling stressed, but commonly in spoken English.

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So when you're talking to your friends, you hear this much more often, stressed out.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Stressed out.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's really stressed out lately.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All right.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So we're stressed out.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Or another word that kind of means the same is this is nerve-wracking.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Nerve-wracking.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So nerves are those things in our body that help us feel things, right?

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And so something that racks our nerves makes us very, very tense, very anxious, very uncomfortable.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So it makes you very nervous.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Right.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So there are some movies that are nerve-wracking.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
For example, suspense movies like Hitchcock's movies like Psycho or The Birds.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Or like horror, like maybe Saw.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Nerve-wracking.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Also, some people think that roller coasters are nerve-wracking.

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They're very, very anxious when they ride roller coasters.

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Right.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So let's listen to a couple of more examples of different situations where we can use this phrase nerve-wracking.

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Example one.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I think being a doctor is one of the most nerve-wracking jobs in the world.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Example two.

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Skydiving was one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of my life.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I almost had a heart attack.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Example three.

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The final match between Brazil and Italy was incredibly nerve-wracking.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And there's another way to describe this feeling.

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Again, it's a little bit different, but very, very similar.

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We can say someone is feeling on edge.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
On edge.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So this person was feeling on edge.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But what does that mean exactly?

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're like at the edge.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Why do you have to ask so many questions?

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay, listen.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This is basic.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay, Marco?

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Are you walking me?

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
On edge today.

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Someone who is on edge is easily angered, right?

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So it's very easy to make this person upset or angry.

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Someone who just quit smoking might be on edge.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That means it's very, very easy to get them to be upset.

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So yeah, you are on edge, right?

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Exactly.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He's on edge.

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Or he seems on edge, doesn't he?

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay, very good.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Wow, these three words that we've just looked at are really interesting and very, very useful.

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I guess you can describe many different situations or a person that's going through these feelings, right?

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Absolutely.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I think there's a thousand ways to describe being nervous or anxious or upset.

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So maybe we should take another listen to today's dialogue and figure out how exactly we use these words.

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And when we come back, we'll be talking about some other phrases that are useful.

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Bye.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Carrie, are you okay?

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You seem a bit down.

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's so hard to talk to him at times.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something.

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He does have a pretty nerve-wracking job, you know.

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day, but he always shuts down and brushes me off.

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Men are like that, you know.

169
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge, and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I guess you're right.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What do you think I should do?

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He wasn't always as grouchy, you know.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he's down, and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You are something else, you know that.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Alright, great.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So now that we're back, we can start with a couple of different phrases now on Fluency Builder.

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Fluency Builder Alright, so Marco, here's the big question.

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What makes you lose your temper?

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I think what makes me lose my temper very, very easily is like a dirty house or like a dirty room.

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Really?

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're a neat freak.

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Not really neat freak, but like if it's not at least semi-clean, you know, it really bothers me.

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay, so this great phrase, lose your temper or lose one's temper, is a phrase we use in English to describe getting angry.

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Alright, so maybe you're okay, you're a little frustrated with something, but someone does something like throws all of their clothes on the floor.

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Marco here says, that's it.

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm tired of this.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're always throwing your clothes on the floor.

188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And that's an example of Marco losing his temper.

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What about you?

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What makes you lose your temper?

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You hear this?

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What is that?

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, drilling?

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Construction?

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hammering?

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
When people tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, or when they like stomp their feet, feet, feet.

197
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Like when they're nervous.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,000
When they make noise, yeah.

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So slowly it's like, okay, fine, calm down.

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's okay.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay, no, seriously, stop it.

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And then all of a sudden, I just can't stand it anymore.

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Exactly.

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Alright, so that's what makes you lose your temper.

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll be sure to keep my eye out for that and not tap my pen.

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Please don't.

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Alright, so okay, you lose your temper and now there are situations sometimes where you need to brush someone off.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Alright, or when you get brushed off and that's not a very good feeling.

209
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But this phrase, to brush someone off, you've heard the word brush before.

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's the word that we use to brush your hair or brush your teeth exactly.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
When you brush someone off, it's like saying that you're ignoring them.

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah, so you ignore them or you basically tell them to go away very subtly sometimes or very directly.

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Exactly.

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And so to brush someone off is to avoid their company.

215
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And so a lot of times when people are angry, they like to be alone, so they brush you off.

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So I could say, hey, did you want to go see that movie tonight?

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No, I can't.

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have to do something tonight.

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And then Marco walks away while we're talking.

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He's brushing me off.

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He's ignoring me.

222
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, so it happens.

223
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And also maybe some people can make up excuses and that's also brushing someone off, right?

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Right, exactly.

225
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So to brush someone off or he brushed me off doesn't feel good.

226
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Alright.

227
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And well, all of these, all of these bad feelings, brushing somebody off, maybe you feel stressed out.

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
In the end, you always need a good friend to cheer you up, right?

229
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And that's what this dialogue is all about.

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Exactly.

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And so friends are actually the people that do that the best or family, I think.

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And well, we can break this phrase down because most of it's pretty clear, but cheer might be a new word for some of our listeners.

233
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Maybe we've heard of the term cheerleader, you know, like give me an A, give me a B.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Or cheers.

235
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Or people cheering.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Or cheers when the beer, yeah.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So cheer is like happiness.

238
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So someone who can cheer you up is someone who makes you happy.

239
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Remember that down we had earlier?

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm feeling down.

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We're trying to cheer someone up.

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We're trying to make them go up and be happy.

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Exactly.

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So you want to cheer up your friends or maybe if you're feeling a bit down, a family member will try and cheer you up.

245
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Do you need someone to cheer you up, Marco?

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes, I do.

247
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, let's go have a drink and eat some popcorn and be cheered up.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's what cheers me up.

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Or chocolate always cheers me up.

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, I know where there's some of that.

251
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Alright.

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases, but the last sentence of the dialogue is maybe a little bit strange, right?

253
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
When she says, you are something else.

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You know that?

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Something what?

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Is she an alien?

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Is she a monkey?

258
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What does she mean when she says you are something else?

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's a great question.

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, this might be a little bit hard to understand at first, but she's saying, I can't believe you.

261
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
She's like, there's no one like you.

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're really something else.

263
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You know that?

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So it's kind of like a joke, but what she's saying is, I can't believe you.

265
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You just want to go on and encourage me to find another boy.

266
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're unbelievable.

267
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So it could be, is it on a positive note or can it be both positive and negative?

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, here we've got two friends who are using it, so it's a positive note, but she's kind of making fun of her saying, I can't believe you.

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But it can be more negative.

270
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Like if you're fighting with her boyfriend and her boyfriend cheats on her and she's like, you're really something else.

271
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You are something else.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You know that?

273
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's like, there's no comparison.

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You're the worst.

275
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, exactly.

276
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So yeah, it really depends on how this is used and what the tone of voice is, so how someone says it.

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But in this case, I think it's kind of a joke joke, but it's a positive.

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Right.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Very interesting.

280
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's very spoken English, as you say, because all the words that we see there, they're pretty simple, but the context or the connotation, the meaning is very, very different from the actual words.

281
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
All right.

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So let's listen to this dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Okay.

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll talk to you later.

285
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Bye.

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Carrie, are you okay?

287
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You seem a bit down.

288
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.

289
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing.

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's so hard to talk to him at times.

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something.

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He does have a pretty nerve-wracking job, you know.

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood.

294
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day, but he always shuts down and brushes me off.

295
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Men are like that, you know.

296
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge, and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I guess you're right.

298
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What do you think I should do?

299
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He wasn't always as grouchy, you know.

300
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he's down, and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one.

301
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You are something else, you know that.

302
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So, Catherine, are you a grouchy person?

303
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Are you happy?

304
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Do you have a bad temper?

305
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, these are, well, very interesting questions, Marco.

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Thank you for asking.

307
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No, the first time, am I grouchy?

308
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No, not very.

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Only before 9 a.m.

310
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You're not a morning person.

311
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Not a morning person, so I'm very grouchy in the morning, but I'm generally pretty good about losing my temper.

312
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It doesn't happen very often.

313
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Oh, really?

314
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But I do get frustrated with things like tapping or when people eat with their mouth open.

315
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, yeah, that's terrible.

316
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I hate that as well.

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah, I can't stand it.

318
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Or I really don't like when people bite their nails.

319
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It also makes me lose my temper.

320
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't know, it more than makes me lose my temper, it's kind of annoying, right?

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It is annoying.

322
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So what makes you really lose your temper?

323
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
We say, what makes you blow your top?

324
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Think about a volcano.

325
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It really grinds my gears.

326
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I would say the worst is when somebody lies to me, like, straight in my face.

327
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Like, I know they're lying, I know you're lying, and they still just lie straight at me.

328
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I agree.

329
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So what's something that really cheers you up?

330
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Because we talked about, like, going out with a friend maybe helps you cheer up, but is there one thing, some kind of remedy?

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I've actually, I like to go shopping.

332
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Really?

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah.

334
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I mean, I won't buy anything like clothes or anything like that.

335
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Usually I'll get maybe something for somebody else or for the house or something.

336
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's very strange.

337
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Helps you, like, clear your mind.

338
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, it's just like walking around and spending a little bit of money.

339
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't know, it's kind of a good remedy.

340
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah, I think so.

341
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What about you?

342
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What cheers you up?

343
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I kind of like to organize things.

344
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Really?

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah.

346
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So if I'm really angry or really upset about something, I'll alphabetize all of my books.

347
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, so A to Z.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
