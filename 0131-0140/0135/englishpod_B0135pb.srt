00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,660
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:06,400
Welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,139
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,560
And my name is Catherine.

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:09,199
Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,380
Today, Marco, what are we talking about?

7
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,419
Well, today we are not really in the best mood.

8
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:16,339
What do you mean?

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,620
We're kind of sad.

10
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,820
We're kind of nervous.

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,620
We're not feeling very well.

12
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,739
Yeah, it's a cloudy day.

13
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,440
Maybe that's why.

14
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,300
The blues.

15
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,239
The blues.

16
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,780
So, yeah, that's what we're talking about today.

17
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:38,079
We're going to have a lot of different descriptive words to express, maybe feeling sad or maybe you're angry or you're nervous or something like that.

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,240
OK, well, this is a very useful lesson.

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,460
Hopefully, you're not feeling this way.

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,939
But if you have to talk about someone who is, I've got lots of words for you.

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,000
But first, we're going to preview a couple in today's vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,119
Vocabulary preview.

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,500
All right.

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,200
So today on vocabulary preview, we're going to look at two words.

25
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:58,640
And the first one is a way of saying that you feel sad.

26
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,219
So basically, I'm feeling down.

27
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:02,799
OK, down.

28
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,099
You might have heard this before because it's the opposite of the word up.

29
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:06,700
Exactly.

30
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,120
So you're not feeling up happy, looking up.

31
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,640
You're feeling down.

32
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,760
This is another word for sad like Marco said.

33
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:15,519
Or you can also say, I'm a bit down today, right?

34
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,180
Yeah, I'm a bit down today.

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,879
Or, you look really down.

36
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,680
Are you OK?

37
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,200
Yeah, so you look sad.

38
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Is everything OK?

39
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,680
So down.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,900
So now another feeling or a way that a person is feeling, maybe that person is grouchy.

41
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,420
Would you please stop talking so loud, Marco?

42
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,960
I think you have...

43
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,560
No, seriously.

44
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:37,099
Don't be grouchy, Catherine.

45
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:37,799
Geez.

46
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,019
No, so grouchy is a way someone acts, usually when they're in a bad mood.

47
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,700
Right.

48
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,939
So it's not like really angry.

49
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,579
You're not angry, but you're not very happy either.

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,859
You're not very nice to people.

51
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,079
So there's a very famous TV character called Oscar the Grouch on Sesame Street.

52
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,239
Look for him on YouTube or Youku.

53
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,260
And he's very, very good for learning about this feeling grouchy because he's a grouchy guy.

54
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,140
Yeah, he's always angry or never happy, basically.

55
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:07,420
Right.

56
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,919
He's always complaining about something.

57
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,099
So that word again is grouchy.

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:11,819
All right.

59
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,900
So after taking a look at these two words, we're ready now to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

60
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,039
Let's see what this dialogue is about, if maybe they're grouchy or maybe just sad.

61
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,000
Fine.

62
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:29,060
OK, I'll talk to you later.

63
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:29,840
Bye.

64
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,539
Carrie, are you OK?

65
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,900
You seem a bit down.

66
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,979
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.

67
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,759
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing.

68
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,020
It's so hard to talk to him at times.

69
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,419
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something.

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,180
He does have a pretty nerve-wracking job, you know.

71
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,520
Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood.

72
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:59,939
I tried to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day, but he always shuts down and brushes me off.

73
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:01,680
Men are like that, you know.

74
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,819
They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge.

75
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:08,620
And the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

76
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,080
I guess you're right.

77
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,039
What do you think I should do?

78
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,060
He wasn't always as grouchy, you know.

79
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,840
Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he's down.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,360
And if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one.

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,300
You are something else, you know that.

82
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,419
All right, so two girls talking about guys.

83
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:33,460
I guess guys have a bad temper sometimes, right?

84
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,840
I think anyone can have a bad temper.

85
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:43,159
But we're talking today about one of the boyfriend of one of these girls who has a very bad temper and has been very grouchy recently.

86
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,639
And that's why she's feeling a bit down.

87
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,740
So let's take a look at those words now in Language Takeaway.

88
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:02,000
All right, so in today's Language Takeaway, we've got some wonderful words for you, words that are very good for describing stress or having anxiety.

89
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,439
And the first of these words is something you hear all the time, especially with young people.

90
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,219
Right.

91
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,539
Somebody is stressed out.

92
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:13,120
My gosh, Marco, I'm so stressed out.

93
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,980
I have 10 homework assignments to do and softball practice.

94
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,860
And my mom wants me to help cook dinner tonight.

95
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,399
Oh, you really are stressed out.

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:23,720
I am.

97
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,060
I don't have any homework and I don't live with my mom.

98
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,740
But being stressed out is usually something you feel when you have too much stuff to do.

99
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:41,980
So maybe you can be stressed out because of school, like in your case, or maybe at work you have a lot of things to do or a project to finish, right?

100
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:42,699
Exactly.

101
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:50,759
And I just want to point out here that you can say I'm stressed or I'm feeling stressed, but commonly in spoken English.

102
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,819
So when you're talking to your friends, you hear this much more often, stressed out.

103
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:55,519
Stressed out.

104
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:56,879
He's really stressed out lately.

105
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,019
All right.

106
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,420
So we're stressed out.

107
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,939
Or another word that kind of means the same is this is nerve-wracking.

108
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,100
Nerve-wracking.

109
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,279
So nerves are those things in our body that help us feel things, right?

110
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,459
And so something that racks our nerves makes us very, very tense, very anxious, very uncomfortable.

111
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:16,139
Okay.

112
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,579
So it makes you very nervous.

113
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,459
Right.

114
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,480
So there are some movies that are nerve-wracking.

115
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,540
For example, suspense movies like Hitchcock's movies like Psycho or The Birds.

116
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,500
Or like horror, like maybe Saw.

117
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,720
Nerve-wracking.

118
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,019
Also, some people think that roller coasters are nerve-wracking.

119
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,540
They're very, very anxious when they ride roller coasters.

120
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,100
Right.

121
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:45,220
So let's listen to a couple of more examples of different situations where we can use this phrase nerve-wracking.

122
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,040
Example one.

123
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,160
I think being a doctor is one of the most nerve-wracking jobs in the world.

124
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,639
Example two.

125
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:59,699
Skydiving was one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of my life.

126
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,800
I almost had a heart attack.

127
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,100
Example three.

128
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:10,279
The final match between Brazil and Italy was incredibly nerve-wracking.

129
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,959
And there's another way to describe this feeling.

130
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,439
Again, it's a little bit different, but very, very similar.

131
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,240
We can say someone is feeling on edge.

132
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,120
On edge.

133
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,779
So this person was feeling on edge.

134
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:25,860
But what does that mean exactly?

135
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,620
You're like at the edge.

136
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,220
Why do you have to ask so many questions?

137
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:30,360
Okay, listen.

138
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,120
This is basic.

139
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:32,899
Okay, Marco?

140
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,540
Are you walking me?

141
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:36,579
On edge today.

142
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:41,839
Someone who is on edge is easily angered, right?

143
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:45,540
So it's very easy to make this person upset or angry.

144
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,500
Someone who just quit smoking might be on edge.

145
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,939
That means it's very, very easy to get them to be upset.

146
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,199
So yeah, you are on edge, right?

147
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,019
Exactly.

148
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,319
He's on edge.

149
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,500
Or he seems on edge, doesn't he?

150
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,339
Okay, very good.

151
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,339
Wow, these three words that we've just looked at are really interesting and very, very useful.

152
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,620
I guess you can describe many different situations or a person that's going through these feelings, right?

153
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,199
Absolutely.

154
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,759
I think there's a thousand ways to describe being nervous or anxious or upset.

155
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,220
So maybe we should take another listen to today's dialogue and figure out how exactly we use these words.

156
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,120
And when we come back, we'll be talking about some other phrases that are useful.

157
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,500
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

158
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,300
Bye.

159
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,980
Carrie, are you okay?

160
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,339
You seem a bit down.

161
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,399
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.

162
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,220
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing.

163
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,459
It's so hard to talk to him at times.

164
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,860
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something.

165
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,660
He does have a pretty nerve-wracking job, you know.

166
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,920
Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood.

167
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:07,319
I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day, but he always shuts down and brushes me off.

168
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,100
Men are like that, you know.

169
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:16,040
They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge, and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

170
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,500
I guess you're right.

171
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,480
What do you think I should do?

172
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
He wasn't always as grouchy, you know.

173
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,759
Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he's down, and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one.

174
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,720
You are something else, you know that.

175
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,559
Alright, great.

176
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,179
So now that we're back, we can start with a couple of different phrases now on Fluency Builder.

177
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:47,360
Fluency Builder Alright, so Marco, here's the big question.

178
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:50,299
What makes you lose your temper?

179
00:08:52,139 --> 00:09:00,360
I think what makes me lose my temper very, very easily is like a dirty house or like a dirty room.

180
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:00,899
Really?

181
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
You're a neat freak.

182
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:10,679
Not really neat freak, but like if it's not at least semi-clean, you know, it really bothers me.

183
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:19,519
Okay, so this great phrase, lose your temper or lose one's temper, is a phrase we use in English to describe getting angry.

184
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:25,740
Alright, so maybe you're okay, you're a little frustrated with something, but someone does something like throws all of their clothes on the floor.

185
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,399
Marco here says, that's it.

186
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,899
I'm tired of this.

187
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,740
You're always throwing your clothes on the floor.

188
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,620
And that's an example of Marco losing his temper.

189
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:35,139
What about you?

190
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,460
What makes you lose your temper?

191
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,620
You hear this?

192
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:39,440
What is that?

193
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,379
Oh, drilling?

194
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:41,820
Construction?

195
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,759
Hammering?

196
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:47,679
When people tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, or when they like stomp their feet, feet, feet.

197
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,679
Like when they're nervous.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,980
When they make noise, yeah.

199
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,480
So slowly it's like, okay, fine, calm down.

200
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,000
It's okay.

201
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,379
Okay, no, seriously, stop it.

202
00:09:56,659 --> 00:10:00,080
And then all of a sudden, I just can't stand it anymore.

203
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,519
Exactly.

204
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,139
Alright, so that's what makes you lose your temper.

205
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:08,259
I'll be sure to keep my eye out for that and not tap my pen.

206
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:08,600
Please don't.

207
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:16,360
Alright, so okay, you lose your temper and now there are situations sometimes where you need to brush someone off.

208
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:21,159
Alright, or when you get brushed off and that's not a very good feeling.

209
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,440
But this phrase, to brush someone off, you've heard the word brush before.

210
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,799
It's the word that we use to brush your hair or brush your teeth exactly.

211
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,759
When you brush someone off, it's like saying that you're ignoring them.

212
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,779
Yeah, so you ignore them or you basically tell them to go away very subtly sometimes or very directly.

213
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:38,500
Exactly.

214
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,399
And so to brush someone off is to avoid their company.

215
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,600
And so a lot of times when people are angry, they like to be alone, so they brush you off.

216
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,200
So I could say, hey, did you want to go see that movie tonight?

217
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,799
No, I can't.

218
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,919
I have to do something tonight.

219
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,879
And then Marco walks away while we're talking.

220
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,179
He's brushing me off.

221
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,320
He's ignoring me.

222
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,860
Yeah, so it happens.

223
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:03,200
And also maybe some people can make up excuses and that's also brushing someone off, right?

224
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:04,100
Right, exactly.

225
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,679
So to brush someone off or he brushed me off doesn't feel good.

226
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:09,899
Alright.

227
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:16,419
And well, all of these, all of these bad feelings, brushing somebody off, maybe you feel stressed out.

228
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:19,960
In the end, you always need a good friend to cheer you up, right?

229
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,720
And that's what this dialogue is all about.

230
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,379
Exactly.

231
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,860
And so friends are actually the people that do that the best or family, I think.

232
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:33,360
And well, we can break this phrase down because most of it's pretty clear, but cheer might be a new word for some of our listeners.

233
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Maybe we've heard of the term cheerleader, you know, like give me an A, give me a B.

234
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,700
Or cheers.

235
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,039
Or people cheering.

236
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,220
Or cheers when the beer, yeah.

237
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,039
So cheer is like happiness.

238
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:48,440
So someone who can cheer you up is someone who makes you happy.

239
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,220
Remember that down we had earlier?

240
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,159
I'm feeling down.

241
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,000
We're trying to cheer someone up.

242
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,840
We're trying to make them go up and be happy.

243
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,519
Exactly.

244
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,980
So you want to cheer up your friends or maybe if you're feeling a bit down, a family member will try and cheer you up.

245
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:02,919
Do you need someone to cheer you up, Marco?

246
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,779
Yes, I do.

247
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,100
Well, let's go have a drink and eat some popcorn and be cheered up.

248
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,200
That's what cheers me up.

249
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,059
Or chocolate always cheers me up.

250
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,320
Oh, I know where there's some of that.

251
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,200
Alright.

252
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:20,759
So we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases, but the last sentence of the dialogue is maybe a little bit strange, right?

253
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,419
When she says, you are something else.

254
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:24,019
You know that?

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,799
Something what?

256
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,059
Is she an alien?

257
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:27,879
Is she a monkey?

258
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,299
What does she mean when she says you are something else?

259
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,240
That's a great question.

260
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,799
Well, this might be a little bit hard to understand at first, but she's saying, I can't believe you.

261
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,740
She's like, there's no one like you.

262
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:39,840
You're really something else.

263
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,419
You know that?

264
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,159
So it's kind of like a joke, but what she's saying is, I can't believe you.

265
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:48,379
You just want to go on and encourage me to find another boy.

266
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,840
You're unbelievable.

267
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,740
So it could be, is it on a positive note or can it be both positive and negative?

268
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:00,980
Well, here we've got two friends who are using it, so it's a positive note, but she's kind of making fun of her saying, I can't believe you.

269
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,179
But it can be more negative.

270
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,700
Like if you're fighting with her boyfriend and her boyfriend cheats on her and she's like, you're really something else.

271
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,200
You are something else.

272
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,879
You know that?

273
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,919
It's like, there's no comparison.

274
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,679
You're the worst.

275
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,659
Yeah, exactly.

276
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:21,559
So yeah, it really depends on how this is used and what the tone of voice is, so how someone says it.

277
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,779
But in this case, I think it's kind of a joke joke, but it's a positive.

278
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Right.

279
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,039
Very interesting.

280
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:37,700
It's very spoken English, as you say, because all the words that we see there, they're pretty simple, but the context or the connotation, the meaning is very, very different from the actual words.

281
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:39,320
All right.

282
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,860
So let's listen to this dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

283
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:50,500
Okay.

284
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,580
I'll talk to you later.

285
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:53,379
Bye.

286
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Carrie, are you okay?

287
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,419
You seem a bit down.

288
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,519
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.

289
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,299
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing.

290
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,559
It's so hard to talk to him at times.

291
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,960
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something.

292
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,720
He does have a pretty nerve-wracking job, you know.

293
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,059
Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood.

294
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:23,500
I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day, but he always shuts down and brushes me off.

295
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,220
Men are like that, you know.

296
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:32,159
They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge, and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

297
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,620
I guess you're right.

298
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,600
What do you think I should do?

299
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,600
He wasn't always as grouchy, you know.

300
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,899
Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he's down, and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one.

301
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,840
You are something else, you know that.

302
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,100
So, Catherine, are you a grouchy person?

303
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,659
Are you happy?

304
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,620
Do you have a bad temper?

305
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,059
Oh, these are, well, very interesting questions, Marco.

306
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:00,879
Thank you for asking.

307
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,779
No, the first time, am I grouchy?

308
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,379
No, not very.

309
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,559
Only before 9 a.m.

310
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,120
You're not a morning person.

311
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,840
Not a morning person, so I'm very grouchy in the morning, but I'm generally pretty good about losing my temper.

312
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,220
It doesn't happen very often.

313
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:13,740
Oh, really?

314
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:18,340
But I do get frustrated with things like tapping or when people eat with their mouth open.

315
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,879
Oh, yeah, that's terrible.

316
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,340
I hate that as well.

317
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,419
Yeah, I can't stand it.

318
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:24,759
Or I really don't like when people bite their nails.

319
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,279
It also makes me lose my temper.

320
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,519
I don't know, it more than makes me lose my temper, it's kind of annoying, right?

321
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,100
It is annoying.

322
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,799
So what makes you really lose your temper?

323
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,860
We say, what makes you blow your top?

324
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,299
Think about a volcano.

325
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:38,799
It really grinds my gears.

326
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,159
I would say the worst is when somebody lies to me, like, straight in my face.

327
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,519
Like, I know they're lying, I know you're lying, and they still just lie straight at me.

328
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,139
I agree.

329
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:53,700
So what's something that really cheers you up?

330
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,120
Because we talked about, like, going out with a friend maybe helps you cheer up, but is there one thing, some kind of remedy?

331
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,740
I've actually, I like to go shopping.

332
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:03,960
Really?

333
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:04,480
Yeah.

334
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,419
I mean, I won't buy anything like clothes or anything like that.

335
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,840
Usually I'll get maybe something for somebody else or for the house or something.

336
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:12,620
It's very strange.

337
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,820
Helps you, like, clear your mind.

338
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,299
Yeah, it's just like walking around and spending a little bit of money.

339
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,700
I don't know, it's kind of a good remedy.

340
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,779
Yeah, I think so.

341
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,320
What about you?

342
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,220
What cheers you up?

343
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,600
I kind of like to organize things.

344
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,000
Really?

345
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,340
Yeah.

346
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,399
So if I'm really angry or really upset about something, I'll alphabetize all of my books.

347
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,659
Yeah, so A to Z.

348
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,720
Wow, see, everyone has different remedies.
