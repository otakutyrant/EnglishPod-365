00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Okay, I'll talk to you later.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Bye.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Carrie, are you okay?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You seem a bit down.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's so hard to talk to him at times.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He does have a pretty nerve-wracking job, you know.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I try to find out what's bothering him, or get him to talk about his day, but he always shuts down and brushes me off.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Men are like that, you know.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They can feel nervous, anxious, or on edge, and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I guess you're right.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What do you think I should do?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He wasn't always as grouchy, you know.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he's down, and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You are something else, you know that.
