00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:07,120
EnglishPod.com Okay, I'll talk to you later.

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:07,900
Bye.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,599
Carrie, are you okay?

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:11,939
You seem a bit down.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,019
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,800
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,059
It's so hard to talk to him at times.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,460
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,239
He does have a pretty nerve-wracking job, you know.

10
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,559
Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood.

11
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:37,939
I try to find out what's bothering him, or get him to talk about his day, but he always shuts down and brushes me off.

12
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:39,740
Men are like that, you know.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,679
They can feel nervous, anxious, or on edge, and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

14
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,119
I guess you're right.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,100
What do you think I should do?

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,119
He wasn't always as grouchy, you know.

17
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,380
Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he's down, and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one.

18
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,320
You are something else, you know that.
