00:00:02,479 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,099
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,860
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,859
So Marco, you've been shopping a lot lately.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:21,440
I have, and this dialogue or this lesson today is one of my favorite pieces of furniture, maybe appliances that I've bought recently, and it's a TV.

6
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,899
Alright, so I'd even go for electronics with that one.

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,539
The electronics department is somewhere you like to hang out.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,280
Uh-huh.

9
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:36,479
Well, I mean, I think every guy loves, you know, like a big screen TV and a home theater system, so you just like go deaf after watching.

10
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,219
And why is that?

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,079
Is bigger really better when it comes to like a 70-inch TV?

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,719
Oh, I don't know.

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:51,060
I think, yeah, the whole experience of just seeing this movie on this huge TV and like having all the sound and, I don't know, it's just something about that.

14
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,979
Or watching a football game with your buddies and you can actually watch.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,719
Okay, that I can appreciate.

16
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,259
But we've got a couple of great words for you.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,340
We're going to preview in today's vocabulary preview.

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,599
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,260
Okay, so on vocabulary preview today, we're going to be looking at two words.

20
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,560
The first one is to appreciate.

21
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:14,319
Alright, so this basically means to like.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,079
Yeah, you appreciate someone, but in this context to enjoy or take advantage of something.

23
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:29,219
So maybe you hear this with a couple, two people who are fighting and the girl says to the guy, you don't appreciate me.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,760
Mm-hmm.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,260
So he doesn't really care about her in the way that she wants him to.

26
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:45,939
Or you could say this about a TV, for example, I can't appreciate my PS3, my great awesome console, my gaming system because my TV is not good enough or big enough or big enough or big enough.

27
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,340
So this means that it could be a lot better if I just bought a better TV.

28
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:50,819
Right.

29
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,280
And if you buy a better TV, then you basically are upgrading or to upgrade.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,260
Okay, so this verb to upgrade means to go from something that's okay to something that's better.

31
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:01,780
Mm-hmm.

32
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:02,340
Exactly.

33
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:08,419
So in previous lessons, we've seen to get a complimentary upgrade, for example, on a flight or in a hotel.

34
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,419
I like that.

35
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,639
Well, you can also get an upgrade on a computer.

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,439
You say, well, my computer's from 1994.

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,419
I really need to get an upgrade.

38
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:17,400
Yeah, for sure.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,759
So to upgrade.

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,139
Now we're gonna be listening to this dialogue for the first time.

41
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,639
We're gonna be buying a TV.

42
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,039
So let's listen.

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,659
Seriously, I don't know why we need to get a new TV.

44
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:46,060
Honey, I told you already, I can't appreciate the graphics level and detail of the games on my TV.

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,539
Hey folks, how can I be of service today?

46
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,900
I'm looking to upgrade to a newer, bigger television set.

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,699
You've come to the right place.

48
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,599
What size are you looking for?

49
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,240
Just a normal-sized TV for a living room.

50
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,520
I see.

51
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,479
Well, this set here is on sale.

52
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,800
It's a 46-inch HD TV screen and it has all the works.

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,340
Three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA, and S-video ports.

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,939
It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or laptop.

55
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,539
This is without a doubt the complete home theater experience.

56
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,139
This is exactly what I need.

57
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,939
Can you imagine watching movies or playing video games on this thing?

58
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,699
Honey, I think it's a bit too big.

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,020
I don't even think it will fit in our living room.

60
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,319
Not to worry, we will deliver and install it in your home.

61
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,219
It comes with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture.

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,719
This is great.

63
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,860
How much will this set me back?

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,560
Lucky for you, this is the last one we have in stock, so it's half off.

65
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,919
I'll take it.

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:07,580
All right, so I'm going to have to defer to you, Marco, on some of these words in today's language takeaway because they're all about TV specifics.

67
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,620
Language takeaway.

68
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:16,420
All right, the first word that we're going to be looking at is graphics, the graphics level.

69
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:25,939
All right, so you might have heard this before with the phrase graphic designer, someone who designs images, but in this case we're talking about graphics, so the way things appear on your TV.

70
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,199
Mm-hmm, so like basically the pictures, right?

71
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,399
So he wanted to appreciate the graphics of his PlayStation 3 better and that's why he wanted a new TV.

72
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:37,459
All right, we could say my computer has amazing graphics.

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,240
It means games are really fun because they look good.

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:48,420
Mm-hmm, or this game has amazing graphics, so the game has, you know, places or scenery that looks really, really real.

75
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:57,000
All right, so graphics, but some kinds of TVs are made to provide those wonderful graphics and those are called HDTV.

76
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,660
Right, an HDTV or that's an acronym for high-definition television.

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:21,019
All right, and I heard some actors and actresses were complaining about HDTV because the picture quality is so good that you can see all of the little problems on their face, the little wrinkles and the pimples and the scars, so be careful because one day we're gonna be able to see way too much.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,459
Exactly, so on high-definition television, that's basically what you get is better definition, better level of graphics.

79
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,620
So more pixels per inch, you can see a lot more clarity.

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,459
Right, so an HDTV.

81
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:41,519
The next thing we're talking about is actually kind of related to the back part of your TV where you plug things in.

82
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,639
Sometimes it's on the side, sometimes on the back.

83
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:48,139
Well, there are different names for different kinds of plugs, so today we're going to talk about two of those.

84
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,540
One of them is USB.

85
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,579
Right, this TV has a USB port which basically stands for Universal Serial Bus.

86
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:59,180
All right, so a port is a place where you plug something in.

87
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:09,819
Your computer has a lot of ports as well, but USB is maybe more common for people who have iPods or computers because this is how we normally connect things to our computers.

88
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,540
So in this case, this television, you could connect maybe your iPod and reproduce videos or pictures onto the TV.

89
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:20,220
Awesome, or in the second case, we have a DVI port.

90
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,879
So DVI, you're gonna have to tell me about this one, Marco, because I'm not so sure.

91
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,920
Well, a DVI is basically a digital video input.

92
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,759
So basically you can connect your computer to the TV and see what's on your screen.

93
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,259
Nice, and so if you have a bunch of movies stored on your computer, you can just plug it into the TV and watch.

94
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,180
Or you can even navigate the internet on a big screen TV.

95
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,220
Cool, yeah.

96
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,240
All right, so what are these three HDMI connectors?

97
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,500
All right, well this is a new technology.

98
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:59,139
Basically, you know how before you used to get your DVD player, your VHS, and you had three cables, two for sound and one for video?

99
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,980
Yeah, they're red, yellow, and white cables.

100
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:10,420
Exactly, so with this new type of cable or technology, with one cable, it takes all the information to the TV, so just one cable for everything.

101
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:18,040
Oh nice, because my problem is I always used to put the wrong cable in the wrong port, so I'd have the red cable on the yellow port, and then I'd say, where's the video?

102
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,459
I can't see, all I can do is listen.

103
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:21,680
Yeah, it happens.

104
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:30,740
So with this, now it's easy, and well, it even, it's a little bit more organized, because I remember I used to have a TV and have, and I had a lot of different things connected to it.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,220
It was just this big spiderweb in the back with all these cables.

106
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:38,500
So an HDMI, high definition multimedia interface connector.

107
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,759
And what else do we have?

108
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:51,480
Well, the last thing we're talking about is actually the place to put your TV, so a lot of people now are putting their TVs on walls like paintings, because these TVs are so thin, so we call this a wall mount.

109
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,519
So a mount, to mount something is also a verb, right?

110
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,800
Yeah, it means to put something up or to hang something up, so many people like to mount their trophies to show off.

111
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,959
Mm-hmm, very good.

112
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,699
So this is what we're doing with the TV, we're going to mount it on the wall like a painting.

113
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,100
Cool, so those are our words for Language Takeaway, let's take another listen to today's dialogue.

114
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,019
We're going to slow it down this time and really figure out what's going on.

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,319
Seriously, I don't know why we need to get a new TV.

116
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:33,639
Honey, I told you already, I can't appreciate the graphics level and detail of the games on my PlayStation 3 on our old TV.

117
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,840
Good afternoon folks, how can I be of service today?

118
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,240
I'm looking to upgrade to a newer, bigger television set.

119
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,940
You've come to the right place, what size are you looking for?

120
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:59,120
Just a normal screen and it has all the works.

121
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,659
Three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA and S-video ports.

122
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:09,240
It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or laptop.

123
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:13,940
This is without a doubt the complete home theater experience.

124
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,299
This is exactly what I need, can you imagine watching movies or playing video games on this thing?

125
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,440
Honey, I think it's a bit too big, I don't even think it will fit in our living room.

126
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,620
Not to worry, we will deliver and install it in your home.

127
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,539
It comes with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture.

128
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:37,259
This is great, how much will this set me back?

129
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:42,000
Lucky for you, this is the last one we have in stock so it's half off.

130
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll take it.

131
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:54,120
All right, so now we're going to be taking a look at three different phrases that we saw in this dialogue in Fluency Builder.

132
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,440
Fluency Builder.

133
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,799
All right, this first phrase is definitely one that I use a lot.

134
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,820
We can talk about food, we can talk about electronics, we can talk about most different things but the phrase here is the works.

135
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,779
He's getting the works.

136
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,120
All right, that means any option he could get, any possibility, he wants it all.

137
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:26,179
Right, so if you're getting a new car for example, right, you're getting the high definition sound system, you're getting nice tires, leather seats, you're getting the works.

138
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:35,659
All right, or if you're getting a hamburger and you want the works, you're getting it with cheese and lettuce and tomato and pepper, bacon, you know, it means every option you're getting it all.

139
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,639
The works.

140
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,480
So I think this word is so versatile that we should maybe listen to some more examples.

141
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,379
Example one.

142
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:50,159
The bridegroom was wearing a morning suit, top hat, gloves, the works.

143
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:52,940
Example two.

144
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,120
He spent over ten thousand dollars on his home theater system.

145
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,740
He got all the works.

146
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:01,980
Example three.

147
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:05,899
I bought a new car with all the works.

148
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:09,019
Magnesium rims, custom paint and leather seats.

149
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:15,779
So now that we've seen the works on the home theater system, he needs to hook it up.

150
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:19,580
All right, so this is an important part and a very exciting part of a new purchase.

151
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,059
So when you buy something, you have to hook it up.

152
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,480
That means you have to plug things together.

153
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:36,240
Okay, so we plug things into the wall for electricity, but also hook up maybe those cores you were talking about earlier, that HDMI connector, that's called hooking up or connecting.

154
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,200
So you would hook up your DVD player to your television.

155
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,000
All right, I could ask you, did you hook up those new speakers to your big TV yesterday?

156
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,240
Very good, right?

157
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,120
So to connect.

158
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,480
It's another way of saying to connect.

159
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:55,779
And finally, the big event when you're buying something is the end, when you have to actually pay.

160
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,940
And this guy is a little bit worried that the things he wants cost a lot of money.

161
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,500
So he asks a really great question.

162
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,620
Yeah, he said, how much will this set me back?

163
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,480
Okay, this sounds a little weird at first, because you could just say, how much will this cost?

164
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,679
But he's speaking in a very colloquial way, very familiar.

165
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,879
And he says, how much will this set me back?

166
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:17,419
Right.

167
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,419
So how much will this cost me?

168
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,159
So how much am I actually going to spend?

169
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,200
So it's just a different way of saying how much does it cost?

170
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,519
But it's like you say more colloquial, it's a lot more native like.

171
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:30,679
Exactly.

172
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:41,019
And so if you're writing your paper, you don't want to write this, this will set you back $500 in economics, but we'd say this in spoken language and our normal daily lives with friends.

173
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,940
So why don't we listen to a couple more examples of set me back.

174
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:47,860
Example one.

175
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,820
This unexpected expense is going to set us back a couple thousand dollars.

176
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:54,980
Example two.

177
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,179
That fancy dinner at the restaurant last night really set us back.

178
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,799
Example three.

179
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,840
I feel guilty about buying this coat.

180
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:09,259
It set me back over $300.

181
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,919
All right, great.

182
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:19,759
So now that we've taken a look at those great phrases and with some good examples, why don't we listen to this dialogue one last time?

183
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,980
Seriously, I don't know why we need to get a new TV.

184
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:38,340
Honey, I told you already, I can't appreciate the graphics level and detail of the games on my PlayStation 3 on our old TV.

185
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,759
Good afternoon, folks.

186
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,840
How can I be of service today?

187
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,259
I'm looking to upgrade to a newer, bigger television set.

188
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,080
You've come to the right place.

189
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,000
What size are you looking for?

190
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,659
Just a normal sized TV for a living room.

191
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:55,860
I see.

192
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:58,879
Well, this set here is on sale.

193
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,120
It's a 46 inch HD TV screen and it has all the works.

194
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA and S video ports.

195
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,279
It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or laptop.

196
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,879
This is without a doubt the complete home theater experience.

197
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:21,500
This is exactly what I need.

198
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,320
Can you imagine watching movies or playing video games on this thing?

199
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,059
Honey, I think it's a bit too big.

200
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,360
I don't even think it will fit in our living room.

201
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,639
Not to worry, we will deliver and install it in your home.

202
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,559
It comes with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture.

203
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,080
This is great.

204
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:42,259
How much will this set me back?

205
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,940
Lucky for you, this is the last one we have in stock so it's half off.

206
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,900
I'll take it.

207
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,879
Okay, so a big TV.

208
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,139
I think it's just a great thing to have at home.

209
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,200
Not to spend too much time in front of the TV but it's good to sit down and watch a movie.

210
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,379
It's nice because now there's so many different things you can do with it.

211
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,299
You can hook up your computer, you can buy a projector, you can play your PS3 or your Wii.

212
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:22,539
So I think there's a lot to do and it's just wonderful how great graphics have come in just like the last five years.

213
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,220
What do you think about having a television set, for example, in the bathroom?

214
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,679
I would say it's a really bad idea but I think I would, well if I have a bathtub, I think it'd be really cool.

215
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:40,279
What about, you know, some people don't like having a television set in their bedroom.

216
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:41,460
I agree with this.

217
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:57,399
I agree because I think it's really important that you have peace and quiet in your bedroom because it's kind of like for me it's an important space where I can just relax and be quiet and I like reading a lot so if I have a TV maybe I'll watch more TV but I'd much rather read a book before bed.

218
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:13,240
True, yeah I definitely agree but you know I've seen people that have TVs in their living rooms, in their dining rooms, even in their kitchen so they're watching something while they're cooking and even in the bathroom like you say in a bathtub well it's nice but some of them I've seen in front of the toilet or something.

219
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:21,659
I would say that the one in the kitchen is nice because if you spend a lot of time in the kitchen you can watch the news while you're cooking or you can actually watch cooking shows and try and practice.

220
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,600
Or soap operas.

221
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:32,240
So I guess it depends on the person, it depends on how much you watch TV but I'm curious to know what our listeners have to say about TVs and big electronics purchases.

222
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:40,120
