EnglishPod.com Welcome to Galenet.

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How can I help you?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I would like to get an internet plan for my house.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Of course.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is for broadband internet with a download speed of 512 kbps.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I have no idea what kbps means.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed of 2 megabytes.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That way, you can play games online without any lag.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You are saving yourself $100 right there.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And we'll throw in this pen drive.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Awesome!
