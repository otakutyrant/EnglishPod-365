EnglishPod.com Welcome to Galenet.

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,679
How can I help you?

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:09,419
Hi.

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:11,839
I would like to get an internet plan for my house.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,839
Of course.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,600
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,500
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,620
This is for broadband internet with a download speed of 512 kbps.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,440
I have no idea what kbps means.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,560
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,700
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

12
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,380
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,640
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed of 2 megabytes.

14
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,880
That way, you can play games online without any lag.

15
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,439
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

16
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,700
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,420
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

18
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,280
You are saving yourself $100 right there.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,040
And we'll throw in this pen drive.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,900
Awesome!
