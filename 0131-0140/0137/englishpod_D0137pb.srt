Hello English learners, welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,120
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:11,080
And my name is Catherine, and today we're talking about something very, very important in the computer age.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,740
Internet.

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,460
Internet and internet connections.

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:25,300
Right, I think, well, so many people use the internet now and have it, but it's sometimes a little bit complicated to maybe get a plan, or maybe if you're not too familiar with the terms, that's what we're going to be looking at today.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,199
So listen out for some of these words today.

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,739
Today we're talking on the phone with someone who's going to help us get a plan.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,280
When we come back, we'll be talking all about what some of these words and phrases mean.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,600
So if you're confused, just wait a couple seconds and we'll be back.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,140
Welcome to Galenet.

12
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,439
How can I help you?

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,179
Hi.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,579
I would like to get an internet plan for my house.

15
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:48,560
Of course.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,359
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,259
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,380
This is for broadband internet with a download speed of 512 kbps.

19
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:07,200
I have no idea what kbps means.

20
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:11,319
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

21
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,400
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

22
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:17,120
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,400
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed of 2 megabytes.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,659
That way, you can play games online without any lag.

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,219
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

26
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,459
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

27
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,200
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

28
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,799
You are saving yourself $100 right there, and we'll throw in this pen drive.

29
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:43,680
Awesome!

30
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,140
Alright, so interesting.

31
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:54,459
A lot of these technical terms specifically for internet and computers and connection and all that stuff.

32
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,920
Yeah, and the nice thing about some of these words is that they can be used in other ways as well.

33
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:07,079
So we've been learning about these and expanding our vocabularies, but they're useful in many other contexts as well.

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,379
Okay, so let's get started with these words now in Language Takeaway.

35
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:23,120
So this first phrase, for example, is something that you see advertised all the time, and well, it's a kind of internet connection.

36
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:24,960
Mm-hmm, broadband internet.

37
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,060
Okay, so internet is pretty clear, but broadband, you might be asking, what the heck can this mean?

38
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,340
Okay, so you have broad.

39
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,180
So broad means wide.

40
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,759
Wide, uh-huh, and a band is basically kind of like a frequency at which something works.

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,599
Like bandwidth.

42
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,759
Bandwidth, uh-huh.

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,039
So you have broadband, you have fast or high-speed internet.

44
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,199
That means the bigger the space is, the more information can be transferred.

45
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,300
So it's a fast connection, essentially.

46
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:50,639
Exactly.

47
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,900
Before broadband, we had dial-up internet.

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
Remember AOL?

49
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,900
Yeah, exactly.

50
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,080
It was so slow.

51
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,919
You had to use your modem and call a number and then get connected by telephone.

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,219
So it was a dial-up connection, but it was so slow.

53
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,479
And every time it broke, the connection would break.

54
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,120
You had to dial up again and give you the whole process.

55
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,020
It was so annoying.

56
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,020
Exactly, so fortunately now not many people use dial-up anymore, and we have broadband internet.

57
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:29,599
Now if you have broadband internet, it's really convenient because you can download any type of application or music, videos, etc.

58
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,500
Right, so this is another key computer word that actually has a couple of different uses.

59
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,979
For example, as you said, you can download music or download photos.

60
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,460
That means you find a photo on the internet that you like, and you can save it on your computer.

61
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,919
But you can also have a download, so it can be a thing, too.

62
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,400
Okay, so if maybe you're downloading three different files, you have three downloads.

63
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,199
Okay, so to download and download.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,580
Very good.

65
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,979
So now with internet, you have different speeds, as we talked about, right?

66
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,479
How fast you're downloading something, and the guy mentioned 512 kbps.

67
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,199
Oh no, not another one of these, kbps.

68
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,419
So this one, actually this one's pretty simple.

69
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,039
You can think about kilobytes.

70
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,100
You've heard about megabytes, kilobytes.

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,540
This is the size.

72
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,319
Mm-hmm, how fast you can receive these packets of information.

73
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,819
So 512 kilobytes per second.

74
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,519
Per second, that's, I have no idea how much that is.

75
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,519
It's maybe a lot, sounds like a lot.

76
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:39,439
Right, well basically it is a lot, but we saw later that he was asking for a connection speed of two megabytes.

77
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,980
Ooh, so mega is bigger than kbps, right?

78
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,379
Right.

79
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,060
All right, so these are different speeds of transferring information, right?

80
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,660
So this is a way for you to see what kind of internet plan you want.

81
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:52,540
Exactly.

82
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,540
And so you have kilobytes, we have megabytes, and basically you want a faster connection speed because you want to avoid lag.

83
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,420
Ooh, lag.

84
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,040
All right.

85
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,040
This is a word that you can use in a lot of different ways.

86
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,019
For example, my brother always lags behind.

87
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,060
Okay, so it's a verb.

88
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,000
But in this case we're talking about the noun, so lag is slowness.

89
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:16,300
Yeah, it's like a delay.

90
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,300
Yeah, it's a delay in something.

91
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,579
So in this case, I can't even play my video games because there's too much lag.

92
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,360
So that means the internet's too slow.

93
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,579
It's too slow, exactly.

94
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,439
So that's what happens when you have a slow connection speed, you have lag.

95
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,319
And as you can say, it refers to something that's slow or delayed.

96
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,180
So you can use it in other contexts when you want to say something is a little bit slow.

97
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,899
Well, and another key thing here as we're talking about internet connections is the router.

98
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,680
So a router is something that helps us to route an internet connection.

99
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,240
So for example.

100
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,959
So it basically distributes the internet connection to different computers or to different users.

101
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,000
And some of these you plug in, and some of them are wireless.

102
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,540
That means without a wire.

103
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:11,579
So a wireless router is something, a little box in your house that allows you to maybe have three or four computers on one broadband connection.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,100
Right.

105
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,699
So it's very popular now.

106
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,680
You go to Starbucks and you have Wi-Fi.

107
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,680
In order to have Wi-Fi or wireless internet, you need a router, a wireless router.

108
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,579
Okay, so wireless router.

109
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,779
And finally, what is something that might get in the way of a connection?

110
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,519
You have a firewall.

111
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,800
Very important security measure when navigating the internet.

112
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,540
Alright, so personal firewall is a firewall that you have on your computer to keep people from spying on you.

113
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,439
This keeps other people out.

114
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:41,300
So it's exactly that.

115
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,180
It's a wall between your computer and the outside world.

116
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:50,860
So it protects you from any type of maybe malicious intruders.

117
00:06:51,339 --> 00:07:03,240
Right, and oftentimes governments and public offices, things like that, law offices, they have firewalls to protect the information that they store because it's so important that it's secretive.

118
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:04,899
Yeah, so firewalls.

119
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:09,420
There are many different types of firewalls, but a personal firewall is just a basic one.

120
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,060
Great, so that is our language takeaway for today.

121
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,839
Let's check out this dialogue again and slow it down a bit this time.

122
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,779
Of course!

123
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,819
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

124
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,699
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

125
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,819
This is for broadband internet, with a download speed of 512 kbps.

126
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,639
I have no idea what kbps means.

127
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,759
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

128
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,879
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

129
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,579
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

130
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,899
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed of 2 megabytes.

131
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,100
That way you can play games online without any lag.

132
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,720
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

133
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,920
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

134
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,019
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

135
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,600
You are saving yourself $100 right there, and we'll throw in this pen drive.

136
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,480
Awesome!

137
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,779
Alright, great.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,100
So we just heard all these words that we looked at before, but now why don't we take a look at some of these phrases in Fluency Builder.

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,940
Fluency Builder What's this first one?

140
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,620
I can't read it.

141
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,539
I have no idea.

142
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,100
What?

143
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,360
Didn't you write it down?

144
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,320
I have no idea what you're talking about.

145
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,000
Alright, enough games.

146
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:49,080
No, I have no idea.

147
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,639
Well, it's going to treat this as a phrase that gets said as is.

148
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,500
We're not going to take bits and pieces of it.

149
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,120
So I have no idea, or he has no idea, is a way to say, listen.

150
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,279
I don't know.

151
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,820
I don't know.

152
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,000
I really don't know.

153
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:03,440
Right.

154
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,779
The guy was talking about KBPS and all these things, and the other guy was like, I have no idea what you're talking about.

155
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,720
I don't understand.

156
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,059
And I can definitely empathize.

157
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:13,580
You can relate.

158
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,379
Yeah.

159
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,059
Well, we'll leave that for another one.

160
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,539
But after this, we've got bucks.

161
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,600
Alright, so bucks.

162
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,019
Is this slang?

163
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,720
Bucks.

164
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,559
A hundred bucks.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,679
Two hundred bucks.

166
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,379
A lot of money.

167
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:25,980
Right.

168
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,600
So bucks is basically another way of saying dollars.

169
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,620
Alright, so this is a way that most Americans talk about money.

170
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,700
It's one buck is one US dollar.

171
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,580
Alright, so could I borrow ten bucks, Marco?

172
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:38,980
Right.

173
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,740
Yeah, sure.

174
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,279
Here you go.

175
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,460
Now, bucks, you can only use it for American currency, right?

176
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
You can't use it for, like, euros.

177
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:45,220
No.

178
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,740
No, no.

179
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,620
You can't say, like, ten euros would be ten bucks.

180
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:48,500
No, no, no, no.

181
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,720
Usually you say this about American dollars, and you say this just when you're hanging out, or how much does this cost?

182
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,519
Oh, five bucks.

183
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:55,240
Mm-hmm.

184
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,100
Very good.

185
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:02,759
So the guy was telling him about the price of the internet and everything, and he said that he's going to throw in a pen drive, right?

186
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,100
He's going to throw it?

187
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,799
What is this?

188
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,320
He's going to throw it at him.

189
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:08,240
No, he's going to throw in a pen drive for free.

190
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,179
Oh, sweet.

191
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,720
So throw in means to add.

192
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,500
Or include.

193
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:14,139
Include.

194
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,539
So, listen.

195
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,220
Sir, here's your large popcorn, and I'm going to throw in a small Diet Coke for free.

196
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,779
Wow.

197
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,299
How generous of me.

198
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,679
So you throw in something.

199
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,879
You include it for free, right?

200
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:29,580
Exactly.

201
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,440
So this is usually a complimentary item.

202
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Mm-hmm.

203
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,360
Great.

204
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:40,500
I think this word is really interesting, or this phrase, so why don't we listen to a couple of other examples using throw in.

205
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:42,139
Example one.

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,059
If you buy two pizzas, we will throw in another one for free.

207
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,139
Example two.

208
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,259
Tell you what.

209
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,279
I'll buy this computer if you throw in a pair of headphones.

210
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:57,960
Deal?

211
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:02,279
Example three.

212
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,700
The salesman threw in a subscription to the local newspaper for buying his product.

213
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:09,879
Isn't that great?

214
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:12,980
All right, great.

215
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,139
So good examples.

216
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,679
I think it's clear now, the phrases, all these words related to the Internet.

217
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,320
Absolutely, and so useful.

218
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,039
Right.

219
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,919
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

220
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,039
Welcome to Galenet.

221
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:32,320
How can I help you?

222
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,059
Hi.

223
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,460
I would like to get an Internet plan for my house.

224
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,460
Of course.

225
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,240
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

226
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,139
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

227
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,240
This is for broadband Internet with a download speed of 512 kbps.

228
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,059
I have no idea what kbps means.

229
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,179
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

230
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,340
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

231
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,000
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

232
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,279
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed of 2 megabytes.

233
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,519
That way, you can play games online without any lag.

234
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,080
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

235
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,340
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

236
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,059
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

237
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,679
You are saving yourself $100 right there, and we'll throw in this pen drive.

238
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,539
Awesome!

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,360
So the Internet is a big deal nowadays, and now you can do so much on it.

240
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:49,940
Not only navigate websites anymore, but watch movies, download applications, photos, Facebook, all these types of things now that you can do on the Internet.

241
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,200
You can even do it from your phone, like when you're in the bathroom or on the train.

242
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,220
I mean, it's scary.

243
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,440
We're always connected.

244
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,399
Right, so it's interesting.

245
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:07,259
You're always connected, you're always online with people, and it's actually very noticeable when you maybe live somewhere else.

246
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,360
Before, you used to have to write letters.

247
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,259
I don't think many people receive handwritten letters anymore.

248
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:13,919
Never.

249
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:20,019
I'm speaking for myself, I never receive, and I don't write them either, so I guess I'm guilty of it.

250
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,480
So now people just send emails.

251
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:31,779
Obviously it's more convenient, but maybe it's a little bit less significant, maybe, than actually going to the post office or taking the time to write a letter, going to the post office and stuff.

252
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,899
Well, I don't know.

253
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,139
There's something nice about having a physical thing you can hold on to, but I wonder if one day we're going to forget how to write.

254
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,879
Yeah.

255
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,360
You know, like write with a pen.

256
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,799
With a pen and pencil, exactly.

257
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:48,460
We're going to have these little PDAs and these little iPhones, and they're going to talk, and they're going to take everything down in note form for you.

258
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,440
Well, now it's kind of happening with the Kindle, right?

259
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,279
Now you can have books on this electronic device that lets you read through them.

260
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,840
You can carry 100 books with you to the beach.

261
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:08,580
So now you don't even really need physical books anymore, which is good on some level, because you're saving trees and space and all that stuff.

262
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,279
But there's something physical about reading a book.

263
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,759
You hold it, you flip the pages, you know how many pages you have left.

264
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:16,820
I don't know.

265
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:17,340
We'll see.

266
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:20,480
Maybe I'll be a convert one day, but for now, I'm good with paper books.

267
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,139
All right, so what do you guys think about the Internet, about electronic books?

268
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,259
You can also tell us any problems or confusion you have with the things that we talked about today.

269
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:32,759
Hopefully everything is clear, but if not, we are here to answer your questions.

270
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,700
We like to do so, so check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

271
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,980
All right, we'll see you guys there, and until next time.

272
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,860
Goodbye, everyone.
