Hello English learners, welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And my name is Catherine, and today we're talking about something very, very important in the computer age.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Internet.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Internet and internet connections.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Right, I think, well, so many people use the internet now and have it, but it's sometimes a little bit complicated to maybe get a plan, or maybe if you're not too familiar with the terms, that's what we're going to be looking at today.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So listen out for some of these words today.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Today we're talking on the phone with someone who's going to help us get a plan.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
When we come back, we'll be talking all about what some of these words and phrases mean.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So if you're confused, just wait a couple seconds and we'll be back.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Welcome to Galenet.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
How can I help you?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hi.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I would like to get an internet plan for my house.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Of course.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is for broadband internet with a download speed of 512 kbps.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I have no idea what kbps means.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed of 2 megabytes.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That way, you can play games online without any lag.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You are saving yourself $100 right there, and we'll throw in this pen drive.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Awesome!

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Alright, so interesting.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A lot of these technical terms specifically for internet and computers and connection and all that stuff.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, and the nice thing about some of these words is that they can be used in other ways as well.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So we've been learning about these and expanding our vocabularies, but they're useful in many other contexts as well.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay, so let's get started with these words now in Language Takeaway.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So this first phrase, for example, is something that you see advertised all the time, and well, it's a kind of internet connection.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Mm-hmm, broadband internet.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay, so internet is pretty clear, but broadband, you might be asking, what the heck can this mean?

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, so you have broad.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So broad means wide.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Wide, uh-huh, and a band is basically kind of like a frequency at which something works.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Like bandwidth.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Bandwidth, uh-huh.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So you have broadband, you have fast or high-speed internet.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That means the bigger the space is, the more information can be transferred.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So it's a fast connection, essentially.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Exactly.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Before broadband, we had dial-up internet.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Remember AOL?

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, exactly.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It was so slow.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You had to use your modem and call a number and then get connected by telephone.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So it was a dial-up connection, but it was so slow.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And every time it broke, the connection would break.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You had to dial up again and give you the whole process.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It was so annoying.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Exactly, so fortunately now not many people use dial-up anymore, and we have broadband internet.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Now if you have broadband internet, it's really convenient because you can download any type of application or music, videos, etc.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Right, so this is another key computer word that actually has a couple of different uses.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
For example, as you said, you can download music or download photos.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That means you find a photo on the internet that you like, and you can save it on your computer.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But you can also have a download, so it can be a thing, too.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, so if maybe you're downloading three different files, you have three downloads.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay, so to download and download.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Very good.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So now with internet, you have different speeds, as we talked about, right?

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
How fast you're downloading something, and the guy mentioned 512 kbps.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh no, not another one of these, kbps.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So this one, actually this one's pretty simple.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can think about kilobytes.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You've heard about megabytes, kilobytes.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is the size.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mm-hmm, how fast you can receive these packets of information.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So 512 kilobytes per second.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Per second, that's, I have no idea how much that is.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's maybe a lot, sounds like a lot.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Right, well basically it is a lot, but we saw later that he was asking for a connection speed of two megabytes.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Ooh, so mega is bigger than kbps, right?

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Right.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
All right, so these are different speeds of transferring information, right?

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So this is a way for you to see what kind of internet plan you want.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Exactly.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And so you have kilobytes, we have megabytes, and basically you want a faster connection speed because you want to avoid lag.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Ooh, lag.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
All right.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is a word that you can use in a lot of different ways.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
For example, my brother always lags behind.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay, so it's a verb.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But in this case we're talking about the noun, so lag is slowness.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, it's like a delay.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah, it's a delay in something.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So in this case, I can't even play my video games because there's too much lag.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So that means the internet's too slow.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's too slow, exactly.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So that's what happens when you have a slow connection speed, you have lag.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And as you can say, it refers to something that's slow or delayed.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So you can use it in other contexts when you want to say something is a little bit slow.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, and another key thing here as we're talking about internet connections is the router.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So a router is something that helps us to route an internet connection.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So for example.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So it basically distributes the internet connection to different computers or to different users.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And some of these you plug in, and some of them are wireless.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That means without a wire.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So a wireless router is something, a little box in your house that allows you to maybe have three or four computers on one broadband connection.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Right.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So it's very popular now.

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You go to Starbucks and you have Wi-Fi.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
In order to have Wi-Fi or wireless internet, you need a router, a wireless router.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay, so wireless router.

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And finally, what is something that might get in the way of a connection?

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You have a firewall.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Very important security measure when navigating the internet.

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Alright, so personal firewall is a firewall that you have on your computer to keep people from spying on you.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This keeps other people out.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So it's exactly that.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's a wall between your computer and the outside world.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So it protects you from any type of maybe malicious intruders.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Right, and oftentimes governments and public offices, things like that, law offices, they have firewalls to protect the information that they store because it's so important that it's secretive.

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, so firewalls.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There are many different types of firewalls, but a personal firewall is just a basic one.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Great, so that is our language takeaway for today.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's check out this dialogue again and slow it down a bit this time.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Of course!

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is for broadband internet, with a download speed of 512 kbps.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I have no idea what kbps means.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed of 2 megabytes.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That way you can play games online without any lag.

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You are saving yourself $100 right there, and we'll throw in this pen drive.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Awesome!

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Alright, great.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So we just heard all these words that we looked at before, but now why don't we take a look at some of these phrases in Fluency Builder.

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Fluency Builder What's this first one?

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I can't read it.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I have no idea.

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What?

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Didn't you write it down?

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Alright, enough games.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No, I have no idea.

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Well, it's going to treat this as a phrase that gets said as is.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We're not going to take bits and pieces of it.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So I have no idea, or he has no idea, is a way to say, listen.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't know.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't know.

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I really don't know.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Right.

154
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The guy was talking about KBPS and all these things, and the other guy was like, I have no idea what you're talking about.

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't understand.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And I can definitely empathize.

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You can relate.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah.

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, we'll leave that for another one.

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But after this, we've got bucks.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Alright, so bucks.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Is this slang?

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Bucks.

164
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
A hundred bucks.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Two hundred bucks.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A lot of money.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Right.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So bucks is basically another way of saying dollars.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Alright, so this is a way that most Americans talk about money.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's one buck is one US dollar.

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Alright, so could I borrow ten bucks, Marco?

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Right.

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, sure.

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Here you go.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Now, bucks, you can only use it for American currency, right?

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You can't use it for, like, euros.

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No.

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No, no.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You can't say, like, ten euros would be ten bucks.

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No, no, no, no.

181
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Usually you say this about American dollars, and you say this just when you're hanging out, or how much does this cost?

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, five bucks.

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Mm-hmm.

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Very good.

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So the guy was telling him about the price of the internet and everything, and he said that he's going to throw in a pen drive, right?

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He's going to throw it?

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What is this?

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He's going to throw it at him.

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No, he's going to throw in a pen drive for free.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh, sweet.

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So throw in means to add.

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Or include.

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Include.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So, listen.

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Sir, here's your large popcorn, and I'm going to throw in a small Diet Coke for free.

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Wow.

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
How generous of me.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So you throw in something.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You include it for free, right?

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Exactly.

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So this is usually a complimentary item.

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Mm-hmm.

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Great.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I think this word is really interesting, or this phrase, so why don't we listen to a couple of other examples using throw in.

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Example one.

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you buy two pizzas, we will throw in another one for free.

207
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Example two.

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Tell you what.

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll buy this computer if you throw in a pair of headphones.

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Deal?

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Example three.

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The salesman threw in a subscription to the local newspaper for buying his product.

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Isn't that great?

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
All right, great.

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So good examples.

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think it's clear now, the phrases, all these words related to the Internet.

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Absolutely, and so useful.

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Right.

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

220
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Welcome to Galenet.

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
How can I help you?

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hi.

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I would like to get an Internet plan for my house.

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Of course.

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is for broadband Internet with a download speed of 512 kbps.

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I have no idea what kbps means.

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

232
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed of 2 megabytes.

233
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That way, you can play games online without any lag.

234
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

235
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You are saving yourself $100 right there, and we'll throw in this pen drive.

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Awesome!

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So the Internet is a big deal nowadays, and now you can do so much on it.

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Not only navigate websites anymore, but watch movies, download applications, photos, Facebook, all these types of things now that you can do on the Internet.

241
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You can even do it from your phone, like when you're in the bathroom or on the train.

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I mean, it's scary.

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We're always connected.

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Right, so it's interesting.

245
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You're always connected, you're always online with people, and it's actually very noticeable when you maybe live somewhere else.

246
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Before, you used to have to write letters.

247
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't think many people receive handwritten letters anymore.

248
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Never.

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm speaking for myself, I never receive, and I don't write them either, so I guess I'm guilty of it.

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So now people just send emails.

251
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Obviously it's more convenient, but maybe it's a little bit less significant, maybe, than actually going to the post office or taking the time to write a letter, going to the post office and stuff.

252
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Well, I don't know.

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There's something nice about having a physical thing you can hold on to, but I wonder if one day we're going to forget how to write.

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah.

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You know, like write with a pen.

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
With a pen and pencil, exactly.

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We're going to have these little PDAs and these little iPhones, and they're going to talk, and they're going to take everything down in note form for you.

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, now it's kind of happening with the Kindle, right?

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Now you can have books on this electronic device that lets you read through them.

260
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You can carry 100 books with you to the beach.

261
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So now you don't even really need physical books anymore, which is good on some level, because you're saving trees and space and all that stuff.

262
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But there's something physical about reading a book.

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You hold it, you flip the pages, you know how many pages you have left.

264
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't know.

265
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We'll see.

266
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Maybe I'll be a convert one day, but for now, I'm good with paper books.

267
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
All right, so what do you guys think about the Internet, about electronic books?

268
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You can also tell us any problems or confusion you have with the things that we talked about today.

269
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Hopefully everything is clear, but if not, we are here to answer your questions.

270
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We like to do so, so check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

271
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
All right, we'll see you guys there, and until next time.

272
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Goodbye, everyone.
