00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, guys.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Catherine.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're going to be looking at another lesson as part of our sports series.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And this time, well, it's a debate.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Is it a game or is it a sport?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, it's a sport.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You have to work your mind.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we're looking at chess, a very old, very popular sport, very difficult to play as well.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It takes a lot of practice.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And believe me, it's frustrating at the beginning.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And I'm still kind of in the beginning intermediate stages.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But, yeah, it takes a lot of practice and it takes a lot of time to familiarize yourself with the rules.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Right.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So we're going to be learning a little bit more about the pieces and the rules today.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, perfect.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So we're not going to preview anything.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and talk about the sport.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Bobby, come here.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Look what I got here.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What is that?

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A chessboard.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Daddy's going to teach you how to play.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Cool.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Each player gets 16 pieces.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You can be the white ones and I'll play with the black pieces.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now in the front, you set up the pawns.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Those are the least viable pieces and can only move one space forward.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
When you're about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What about all these other pieces?

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
See this one that looks like a tower?

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's called the rook.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The one with the tall hat is called the bishop.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
See this little horsie?

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is called the knight.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a very important piece, so it's best not to let your opponent capture it.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And these two?

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They are husband and wife.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's right.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's the queen and that's the king.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If the other player captures your king, he will say, checkmate.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And the game is over.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Doesn't this sound fun?

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Nah.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This sounds boring.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm going to go play killer zombies on my PlayStation.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Alright, so the kid is obviously not very interested in learning how to play chess.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Not at all.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You know, the art of these kind of slower games might be replaced very soon by video games.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, I guess it doesn't really appeal to a little nine-year-old or ten-year-old instead of playing something like this versus shooting.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, exactly.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But it's a very great game.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's very difficult, like we mentioned.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So we're going to look at the name of the pieces and the rules that are related to these pieces in Language Takeaway.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Language Takeaway Well, the first one you might have heard before because this is a word that is often used in strategy in general.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So the word pawn, a pawn, a pawn usually means something that is not very important that you can use to distract an opponent.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Alright, so on the chess board you have eight pawns.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So these are the ones that you have the most.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But their movement is very limited.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So they can only move two spaces forward on the first move, right?

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Right, or one space after that.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
One space forward.

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And only when it's going to capture another piece can it move diagonally.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Alright, so you can't just go diagonally.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You have to go forward until you're going to take another person's piece to capture it and to go diagonally.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But pawns is funny.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You can also use this word when you're talking about other things like, he used her as a pawn in his little game.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So you want to make an analogy, you want to make a comparison from life to these games, you can use the word pawn.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Pawn.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Very good.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now moving on to the other pieces on the chess board.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
On the very far ends of the board you have the rook.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay, you've got two of these and they kind of look like towers from a castle.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And it's a very, well they're very important pieces and actually my favorite pieces.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Because they're not very important at the beginning of a game, but at the end of a game, boom, boom, boom, you can do a lot of damage.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Because they can go anywhere in straight lines.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Right, so they can go forward, backwards, and to the sides as many spaces as they want.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The whole board if they want.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The whole board.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, so easy pieces to forget about at the beginning, but they're very important.

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And now next to the rook we have the bishop.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, this is very different from the rook because the bishop can also go anywhere, but they can only go diagonally.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Right, so only diagonally.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
They can also move four directions, but diagonally, right?

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Exactly, so you can go forward and backward, but it has to be in a diagonal slanted line.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, and now next to the bishop we have the knight.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Ooh, the knight.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So he's the one galloping on the horse like those old stories of King Arthur we used to hear.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But the knight can go in an L shape, and I've never understood this.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's weird, so it can move two spaces forward and then one to the right or one to the left.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Or it can move two spaces to the right and then one forward.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So it's very strange, but it always has to move three spaces and in the shape of an L.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So I thought maybe he was the drunken piece.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He can go forward a little bit, then he kind of moves to the side.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Right, so that's the knight.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's actually a very, very important piece as well.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And now the two main pieces maybe of the chessboard, the queen and king.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So the king is kind of sad.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He can only move one space.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But the queen is really the killer because she can do anything she wants.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is interesting, right?

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why do they make it like that?

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The queen can move as many spaces as she wants in any direction.

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
While the king can do the same in any direction he wants, but only one space.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I think there's some similarity between real life now.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's like the queen can do anything she wants, and the king can kind of do whatever he wants.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Well, maybe it has to do with the fact that he has to stay put and represent the country.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And she can move around and move behind the scenes and has a little bit more mobility.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Maybe.

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Who knows?

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But in the end, the most important piece is the king, right?

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Once the king is captured, the game is over.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Exactly.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So let's listen to today's dialogue one more time and slow it down a bit and find out if the boy understood any of these rules.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Bobby, come here.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Look what I got you.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What is that?

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A chessboard.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Daddy's going to teach you how to play.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Cool.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay, each player gets 16 pieces.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can be the white ones, and I'll play with the black pieces.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now in the front, you set up the pawns.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Those are the least viable pieces and can only move one space forward.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
When you're about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What about all these other pieces?

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
See this one that looks like a tower?

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's called the rook.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The one with the tall hat is called the bishop.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
See this little horsie?

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is called the knight.

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's a very important piece, so it's best not to let your opponent capture it.

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And these two?

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
They are husband and wife.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's right.

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's the queen and that's the king.

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If the other player captures your king, he will say, checkmate.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And the game is over.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Doesn't this sound fun?

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Nah, this sounds boring.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm going to go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Alright, we're back.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And now why don't we explain a couple of these phrases that we also used to explain the pieces.

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But let's look at some of these more in-depth now in Fluency Builder.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Fluency Builder So Marco, one of the first phrases that we heard was the phrase to move diagonally or a diagonal line.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And so the pawns can sometimes do this and the bishop can do this, but what does it mean to move diagonally?

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, so basically a diagonal line is not a line that goes straight up, right?

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Straight up to the sky, for example, or to the side, right?

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It goes at an angle, so it's maybe going at 45 degrees or 30 degrees, so that's a diagonal movement or a diagonal line.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Exactly.

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The next phrase we have is very strange, and this one you might hear from parents or children.

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He says, a little horsey.

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Little horsey.

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So in many languages we have ways of breaking down words or adding to words to make them sound cuter.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And this is one of those cases.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So for example, little puppy or little kitty or kitten, these are words to make things sound cuter.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So in this case, horse becomes horsey.

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Horsey.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So I want to ride the horsey.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's a cute way of saying I want to ride the cute horse.

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Mommy, mommy, I want to ride the horsey.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So baby talk often involves having these rhyming words.

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Mommy, horsey, doggy, puppy.

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
A doggy, exactly.

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Very good.

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So it's a cute way of saying something.

171
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And now when we were talking about the chess pieces, when another piece takes or gets a piece, you say it captures it.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay, we say capture because, well, maybe it's a bit nicer than killing it, but capture means taking and keeping for yourself.

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So we have a very popular game in America called capture the flag.

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Right, where you have to take each other's flag, right?

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're stealing.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You're stealing.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So yeah, this is the term that is used in chess to capture another piece.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Sometimes, for example, in Spanish, we actually say to eat the other piece.

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Really?

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah, you eat it.

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's weird.

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, we're a little bit more tame in those English-speaking countries, but to capture is a very important phrase, and you're going to hear that in the news as well because you can capture a person.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can capture a criminal.

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Alright, and the final word, and the way that you end a game of chess, you say checkmate.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Checkmate.

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Checkmate.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Checkmate.

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So the game's over.

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Checkmate.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, there's two things that can happen at the end of a game, and well, only one thing can happen at the very end of a game, but you're going to hear these two phrases, and one is check, and the other is checkmate.

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So check means that I can take your king if I want to move.

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Right, it's in danger.

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's in danger, but checkmate is the end all.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This means this is the very, very last part of a game where you cannot do anything, I've trapped you, and I win.

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Right.

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Very good.

197
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So the game is over when somebody says checkmate.

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this very interesting game.

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Cool.

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The one with the tall hat is called the bishop.

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
See this little horsie?

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is called the knight.

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's a very important piece, so it's best not to let your opponent capture it.

204
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And these two?

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They are husband and wife.

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's right.

207
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's the queen, and that's the king.

208
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If the other player captures your king, he will say checkmate, and the game is over.

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Doesn't this sound fun?

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Nah, this sounds boring.

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm going to go play killer zombies on my Playstation.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Pop quiz, Marco.

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Alright.

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The word check and the word mate.

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
They both have meanings in English, but put together, where does this phrase come from?

216
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What could it possibly mean?

217
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I have no idea.

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why don't you tell us?

219
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Because I seriously don't know where it comes from.

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Okay, well this is actually very interesting because I looked it up and I had no idea either because we've always just said this and it doesn't really make sense.

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So I looked it up on the internet and I discovered that the game of chess is actually a very ancient game.

222
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it did not come from England, it did not come from France, it actually came from Persia.

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And in Persian, there are some words that kind of became the English words checkmate that mean the king is captured or the king is defeated.

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay, so that's what it means.

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It doesn't mean the king is dead.

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
No, it doesn't mean that he's dead, it means that he's been taken.

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And so over time, the Persian word went into Arabic and Arabic became French and English and then now we say checkmate.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Checkmate, okay, interesting.

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This is a very interesting word and I'm sure everybody that's listening has a different translation for it in their own language.

230
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I know for example that in Spanish, we would say jákemate.

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Jákemate.

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Right, so I guess like jáke is something's in Czech, it's in danger, and then mate would kind of like kill.

233
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So maybe it's probably not translated properly because as you mentioned, it should mean defeated or captured, not killed.

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So listeners, why don't you let us know how you say checkmate in your language?
