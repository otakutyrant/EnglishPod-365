00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:02,759
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,040
Welcome back to another great lesson here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,759
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:08,060
My name is Catherine.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,679
Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,560
And today we've got a great lesson for you at the upper intermediate level.

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,620
We're going to be talking about an interesting topic, which is gambling.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,739
Yeah, I don't know if you like to do this, Marco.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,719
Go, you know, play some cards, play some poker, blackjack, throw the dice.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,219
I'm actually a bit of a fan of the roulette.

11
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:33,780
You have to throw the ball onto the wheel that's spinning and lands into, like, a little compartment in a number.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,259
Right.

13
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,719
So you can win, like, based on the number and the color.

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,119
But it's interesting because if you get the number right, it pays you 35 times your bet.

15
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:45,299
Wow.

16
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,960
That's a lot of money to win.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,420
A lot of potential there, but there's a lot of numbers on that wheel.

18
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:51,659
But that's the thing.

19
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,719
Some people like gambling.

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,979
Some people don't like it.

21
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:57,579
And in some countries and some states, it's illegal, right?

22
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:58,140
Exactly.

23
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,759
So today we're talking about a city that's looking to legalize this sport.

24
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,200
So we're going to take a listen here at one time.

25
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,780
We come back, we're talking all about what's going on in today's lesson.

26
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:16,719
Did you hear?

27
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,019
The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city.

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,700
Soon you're going to have amazing hotels and casinos here, which would be good for business.

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,200
Are you serious?

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:35,439
Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,659
It disgusts me.

32
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,040
What are you talking about?

33
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,140
How does it exploit people?

34
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,879
Well, to begin with, gambling is addictive.

35
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,060
It ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities.

36
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:52,099
Once you're addicted, it's very difficult to stop.

37
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:56,340
People have lost their houses, cars and have been left out on the street after becoming addicted.

38
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,939
Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk.

39
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,680
Women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for social interaction.

40
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,520
Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:22,080
Geez, now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea, although I have been to Las Vegas and I didn't become addicted or anything like that.

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,500
You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling.

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,099
Now, excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize.

44
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:39,560
All right, so a very strong opinions against gambling, right?

45
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,159
Absolutely.

46
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:46,240
So we've got someone who hasn't really thought it through and another person who has thought way too much about what's going on.

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,879
Right.

48
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,520
And well, he did point out some very interesting arguments against gambling.

49
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,979
And so we're going to take a look at some of the language that person used today in language takeaway.

50
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,900
Language takeaway.

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,319
Well, this first one we've got here is a word that has to do with the topic of today's lesson.

52
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,719
So legalizing gambling, what does it mean to legalize?

53
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:09,139
Right.

54
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:11,699
So to legalize, to make it legal.

55
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,979
So legal is the word that refers to law.

56
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:21,460
And so that means to make something OK, it means to allow something in a state or country.

57
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:21,939
Exactly.

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,139
So in many countries, it's illegal to gamble.

59
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,039
So in this case, the city is looking to legalize it to make it legal.

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:30,960
All right.

61
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,139
So many young people in America would like to see this law changed.

62
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,039
You're not allowed to drink until you're 21 years old.

63
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,120
Drink alcohol, that is.

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,219
So they would like to see the legalization of underage drinking.

65
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,620
Now, is it 21 in all states or in the majority?

66
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,060
Really?

67
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,039
I thought it was only in some of them.

68
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,460
No, it changed in the late 70s, I think.

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,340
But you absolutely cannot drink until you're 21.

70
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:54,120
Wow.

71
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,780
What do you think?

72
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,039
Is that OK or is that?

73
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,419
I think that it encourages young people to drink irresponsibly.

74
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:08,500
And so I believe we should legalize drinking at the age of 18 because it would make people learn how to be more responsible.

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:08,979
Right.

76
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:09,560
Interesting.

77
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
All right.

78
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,379
So we want to legalize underage drinking English fun.

79
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:14,939
All right.

80
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,620
No, let's not manipulate my words.

81
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,420
But this next word is very, very important.

82
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,680
He's saying that gambling or the gambling industry exploits people.

83
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:26,240
OK, exploit.

84
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:28,079
You might have heard this in the news before.

85
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,500
We talk about often in the news the exploitation of people.

86
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:37,040
But in this case, we're talking about exploiting people through money and gambling.

87
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:37,480
Right.

88
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:46,259
So to exploit basically is to take advantage of them to use them for something, not to treat them as people, but to use them as a way to get something.

89
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:46,699
All right.

90
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:54,620
So we often hear about it, as you say, in news about, you know, factories or companies exploiting their employees or something of the sort.

91
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,839
We can also exploit the earth for its resources by taking oil and taking diamonds and taking gold.

92
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,680
OK, so to take advantage of.

93
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,100
Interesting.

94
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,199
So to exploit is the verb, but exploitation.

95
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,839
Is the noun.

96
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,759
All right, that's the thing.

97
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:15,180
So we talk about the exploitation of people in this country or the exploitation of the earth.

98
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,500
And they're talking about how gambling exploits people and how it's a vice.

99
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:21,220
Oh, vices.

100
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,779
So for those of you Christians out there, you might be very familiar with the the sins, right?

101
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,079
The seven deadly sins.

102
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,779
Well, these are all vices, things that you do that are bad.

103
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,699
So drinking too much is a vice.

104
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,180
Right.

105
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,300
Or eating too much.

106
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,579
Right.

107
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,019
Right.

108
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:39,779
Or spending money without having money may be a vice for you.

109
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,160
So addictions are also a type of vice.

110
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:42,379
Right.

111
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,339
Like drinking, smoking or drug abuse.

112
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,000
Exactly.

113
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,699
These are all vices.

114
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,199
So vice is a bad thing.

115
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,500
Now, we often now we may remember this show, the popular American show called Miami Vice.

116
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,240
So what is that?

117
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,279
Well, Miami Vice, it's in the city of Miami and it's about police officers.

118
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,279
So in the police, there's sometimes a group called the Vice Squad.

119
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:08,220
These are people who go out and try and stop people who are doing things that are vices.

120
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,839
Like drugs and gambling.

121
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,920
Yeah, exactly.

122
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:11,779
Vice Squad.

123
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,199
Interesting.

124
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,120
All right.

125
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,839
And now for the last word on language takeaway, we have this interesting word, a bookie.

126
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:18,459
All right.

127
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,899
So if any of you like to go to the horse races, you might be familiar with this one.

128
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:24,740
A bookie is someone who helps you make a bet.

129
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,899
It's his job to help you make a bet.

130
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,160
So we often see it in movies.

131
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,040
Maybe you are betting on a sports competition.

132
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:33,319
Right.

133
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,939
And you are betting on, I don't know, ten dollars against this team.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,680
So you would go to a bookie to place your bet because there's not really any legal place where you can do it.

135
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,319
Exactly.

136
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:52,060
Or if I want to say, OK, tonight the Chicago Bulls are playing the Suns and you want to put one hundred dollars on the Chicago Bulls, that means they're going to win.

137
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,759
So you use a bookie and he helps you put the money down.

138
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,639
Now, usually this is illegal, right?

139
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,060
Generally, it's illegal.

140
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,120
Yeah, it depends.

141
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,160
I guess you can go to a bookie at the horse races and it's illegal.

142
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,779
But generally it's illegal, I think.

143
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,600
OK, so a sports bookie, we would say a sports bookie, right?

144
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,279
Yeah.

145
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,579
Interesting words.

146
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,660
A lot of words related to, as we said, addictions and vices.

147
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,879
But that's, I guess, kind of what the whole gambling industry involves, right?

148
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,399
Absolutely.

149
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,180
All right.

150
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,160
So now that we've seen those great words on language takeaway, let's move on now to fluency builder.

151
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,439
Fluency builder.

152
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:36,240
OK, fluency builders, where we get into some of this really exciting stuff, stuff where we hear some opinions from a person who is not very happy with the gambling industry.

153
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,939
So this first one, gambling is an industry built on deception.

154
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,379
OK, so it's built on deception.

155
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,839
So, well, it's an industry, so it's not really tangible.

156
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:47,500
Right.

157
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,819
So this is a metaphor.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,939
It's like saying that that this industry is dependent on something.

159
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:56,060
And what is it dependent on?

160
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,660
Deception.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,319
Deception.

162
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,259
So what's deception?

163
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,579
So to deceive, right?

164
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,720
That comes from the verb deceive, which basically says like a false appearance, right?

165
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,319
Not really being completely truthful.

166
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,100
OK, this is really good.

167
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:19,699
So a lot of movies that we like to watch or theater is based on deception in a good way because you get the idea that something is a certain way, but it really isn't in real life.

168
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,060
So deception is in a theater may be a good thing, but in general, deception is a bad thing.

169
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,180
I could say, Marco, I'm sorry I deceived you.

170
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,420
You lied to me.

171
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,379
I lied to you.

172
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:30,699
Yeah.

173
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:38,740
So deception usually involves lies or trying to make something seem like something that it's not right.

174
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,100
OK, so it's this industry is built on deception.

175
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:45,799
And he said that the sole purpose of this industry is to make money.

176
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,679
Exactly.

177
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,259
So this this free sole purpose is very, very common.

178
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,299
You hear this a lot.

179
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:55,100
Sole, like the sole, like your human soul, like your human soul is spelled differently.

180
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:55,899
S O L E.

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So you're talking about the one thing only.

182
00:08:59,559 --> 00:08:59,639
Yeah.

183
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,059
So my sole love.

184
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,480
I only have one love.

185
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,059
My sole pair of shoes.

186
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,539
I only have one pair of shoes.

187
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,679
So it's one thing.

188
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,000
One.

189
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:08,159
But the sole purpose.

190
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,399
So the only reason that this industry exists is what?

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,559
For monetary gain.

192
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,559
So monetary monetary.

193
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,059
You might have heard of the International Monetary Fund.

194
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,720
Exactly.

195
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,100
The IMF.

196
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,940
And so monetary refers to money.

197
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:25,519
Money.

198
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:28,279
As the the door said, it's a gas.

199
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:33,740
And the gain, which means basically means making it to get more money.

200
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,039
Yeah.

201
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:41,059
So that's the point that this person is making, that that the sole purpose of the gambling industry is to make money.

202
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:41,940
Ouch.

203
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,000
So he's saying there's no other reason to gamble.

204
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,480
People are in this industry just to make money.

205
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,120
It's greedy.

206
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:54,379
Well, I mean, basically, you could probably say that almost about almost all the all the companies, right?

207
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,519
What about education companies like ours?

208
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:56,879
That's different.

209
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,360
Education is very different.

210
00:09:59,740 --> 00:09:59,919
Absolutely.

211
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,600
So what's another industry that has a sole purpose?

212
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,299
For example, nonprofit organizations.

213
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,259
Their sole purpose is to help people.

214
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:08,679
All right.

215
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,899
OK, I can get into that.

216
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:10,960
Yeah, cool.

217
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:14,059
So sole purpose and monetary gain.

218
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,059
Very useful phrases.

219
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:17,700
But let's take another listen to today's dialogue.

220
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,220
And I put to you some of these great, great new words.

221
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,200
Did you hear the state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city?

222
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,899
Soon you're going to have amazing hotels and casinos here, which would be good for business.

223
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:36,419
Are you serious?

224
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:45,639
Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain.

225
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,799
It disgusts me.

226
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,240
What are you talking about?

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,299
How does it exploit people?

228
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:55,039
Well, to begin with, gambling is addictive.

229
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,259
It ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupt communities.

230
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,299
Once you're addicted, it's very difficult to stop.

231
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,500
People have lost their houses, cars and have been left out on the street after becoming addicted.

232
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,159
Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling, most often because of the action and risk.

233
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,860
Women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for social interaction.

234
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:21,700
Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.

235
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,059
Geez.

236
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:32,179
Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea, although I have been to Las Vegas and I didn't become addicted or anything like that.

237
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:35,700
You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling.

238
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,419
Now, excuse me.

239
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,259
I have a protest rally to organize.

240
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:46,840
All right, so gambling, what are you what are your opinions about it?

241
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,019
Pro gambling or anti gambling?

242
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,480
OK, well, here's the thing.

243
00:11:50,779 --> 00:12:03,139
Gambling is a sport and some it involves money, obviously, but people also don't I don't think should have other people telling them how to spend their money unless they have some kind of problem.

244
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:03,840
Right.

245
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,320
So the law doesn't get involved if you have a drinking problem until you're harmful to people around you.

246
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,059
So I don't think that it's right for the for the government to be able to say, listen, you can't gamble because it's your own money.

247
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:17,200
If it makes you happy, it makes you happy.

248
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,019
Interesting.

249
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:24,320
Now, we've seen very specific cities or places where you can actually gamble in this way.

250
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,440
You have Monaco or Las Vegas or Macau more recently.

251
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:29,820
Right.

252
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,419
So very interesting cities or countries that have been built on the gambling industry, which apparently is a multibillion dollar industry.

253
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:38,179
Absolutely.

254
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,159
I don't know.

255
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,879
What do you think?

256
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,519
Are you against gambling?

257
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,840
Are you for gambling?

258
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,580
I mean, is it one of those things that you can really or do you maybe even like it?

259
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,059
Maybe some people don't even really care for it.

260
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,539
They don't find it fun to play blackjack or go to the play a round of poker or something like that.

261
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:55,659
Well, that's their problem.

262
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,600
I enjoy it.

263
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:57,899
I think it's fun.

264
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,340
I mean, as long as with anything you do it in moderation, that means you don't do it too much.

265
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,600
I think it's OK.

266
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,120
All right.

267
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:12,899
