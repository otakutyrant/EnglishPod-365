00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome back to another great lesson here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we've got a great lesson for you at the upper intermediate level.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're going to be talking about an interesting topic, which is gambling.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, I don't know if you like to do this, Marco.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Go, you know, play some cards, play some poker, blackjack, throw the dice.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm actually a bit of a fan of the roulette.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You have to throw the ball onto the wheel that's spinning and lands into, like, a little compartment in a number.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Right.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So you can win, like, based on the number and the color.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But it's interesting because if you get the number right, it pays you 35 times your bet.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wow.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's a lot of money to win.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A lot of potential there, but there's a lot of numbers on that wheel.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But that's the thing.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Some people like gambling.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Some people don't like it.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And in some countries and some states, it's illegal, right?

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Exactly.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So today we're talking about a city that's looking to legalize this sport.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So we're going to take a listen here at one time.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We come back, we're talking all about what's going on in today's lesson.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Did you hear?

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Soon you're going to have amazing hotels and casinos here, which would be good for business.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Are you serious?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It disgusts me.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What are you talking about?

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How does it exploit people?

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, to begin with, gambling is addictive.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Once you're addicted, it's very difficult to stop.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
People have lost their houses, cars and have been left out on the street after becoming addicted.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for social interaction.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Geez, now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea, although I have been to Las Vegas and I didn't become addicted or anything like that.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now, excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
All right, so a very strong opinions against gambling, right?

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Absolutely.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So we've got someone who hasn't really thought it through and another person who has thought way too much about what's going on.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Right.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And well, he did point out some very interesting arguments against gambling.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And so we're going to take a look at some of the language that person used today in language takeaway.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Language takeaway.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, this first one we've got here is a word that has to do with the topic of today's lesson.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So legalizing gambling, what does it mean to legalize?

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Right.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So to legalize, to make it legal.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So legal is the word that refers to law.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And so that means to make something OK, it means to allow something in a state or country.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Exactly.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So in many countries, it's illegal to gamble.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So in this case, the city is looking to legalize it to make it legal.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All right.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So many young people in America would like to see this law changed.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're not allowed to drink until you're 21 years old.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Drink alcohol, that is.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So they would like to see the legalization of underage drinking.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now, is it 21 in all states or in the majority?

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Really?

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I thought it was only in some of them.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, it changed in the late 70s, I think.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But you absolutely cannot drink until you're 21.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Wow.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What do you think?

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is that OK or is that?

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I think that it encourages young people to drink irresponsibly.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And so I believe we should legalize drinking at the age of 18 because it would make people learn how to be more responsible.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Right.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Interesting.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
All right.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So we want to legalize underage drinking English fun.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
All right.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No, let's not manipulate my words.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But this next word is very, very important.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He's saying that gambling or the gambling industry exploits people.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
OK, exploit.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You might have heard this in the news before.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We talk about often in the news the exploitation of people.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But in this case, we're talking about exploiting people through money and gambling.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So to exploit basically is to take advantage of them to use them for something, not to treat them as people, but to use them as a way to get something.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
All right.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So we often hear about it, as you say, in news about, you know, factories or companies exploiting their employees or something of the sort.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We can also exploit the earth for its resources by taking oil and taking diamonds and taking gold.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
OK, so to take advantage of.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Interesting.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So to exploit is the verb, but exploitation.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is the noun.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
All right, that's the thing.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So we talk about the exploitation of people in this country or the exploitation of the earth.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And they're talking about how gambling exploits people and how it's a vice.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh, vices.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So for those of you Christians out there, you might be very familiar with the the sins, right?

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The seven deadly sins.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Well, these are all vices, things that you do that are bad.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So drinking too much is a vice.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Right.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Or eating too much.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Right.

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Right.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Or spending money without having money may be a vice for you.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So addictions are also a type of vice.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Right.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Like drinking, smoking or drug abuse.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Exactly.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
These are all vices.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So vice is a bad thing.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Now, we often now we may remember this show, the popular American show called Miami Vice.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So what is that?

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, Miami Vice, it's in the city of Miami and it's about police officers.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So in the police, there's sometimes a group called the Vice Squad.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
These are people who go out and try and stop people who are doing things that are vices.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Like drugs and gambling.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, exactly.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Vice Squad.

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Interesting.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
All right.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And now for the last word on language takeaway, we have this interesting word, a bookie.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
All right.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So if any of you like to go to the horse races, you might be familiar with this one.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
A bookie is someone who helps you make a bet.

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's his job to help you make a bet.

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So we often see it in movies.

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Maybe you are betting on a sports competition.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Right.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And you are betting on, I don't know, ten dollars against this team.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So you would go to a bookie to place your bet because there's not really any legal place where you can do it.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Exactly.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Or if I want to say, OK, tonight the Chicago Bulls are playing the Suns and you want to put one hundred dollars on the Chicago Bulls, that means they're going to win.

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So you use a bookie and he helps you put the money down.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Now, usually this is illegal, right?

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Generally, it's illegal.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, it depends.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I guess you can go to a bookie at the horse races and it's illegal.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But generally it's illegal, I think.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OK, so a sports bookie, we would say a sports bookie, right?

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah.

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Interesting words.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A lot of words related to, as we said, addictions and vices.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But that's, I guess, kind of what the whole gambling industry involves, right?

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Absolutely.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
All right.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So now that we've seen those great words on language takeaway, let's move on now to fluency builder.

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Fluency builder.

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:36,000
OK, fluency builders, where we get into some of this really exciting stuff, stuff where we hear some opinions from a person who is not very happy with the gambling industry.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So this first one, gambling is an industry built on deception.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
OK, so it's built on deception.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So, well, it's an industry, so it's not really tangible.

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Right.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So this is a metaphor.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's like saying that that this industry is dependent on something.

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And what is it dependent on?

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Deception.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Deception.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So what's deception?

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So to deceive, right?

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That comes from the verb deceive, which basically says like a false appearance, right?

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Not really being completely truthful.

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
OK, this is really good.

167
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So a lot of movies that we like to watch or theater is based on deception in a good way because you get the idea that something is a certain way, but it really isn't in real life.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So deception is in a theater may be a good thing, but in general, deception is a bad thing.

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I could say, Marco, I'm sorry I deceived you.

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You lied to me.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I lied to you.

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So deception usually involves lies or trying to make something seem like something that it's not right.

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
OK, so it's this industry is built on deception.

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And he said that the sole purpose of this industry is to make money.

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Exactly.

177
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So this this free sole purpose is very, very common.

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You hear this a lot.

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Sole, like the sole, like your human soul, like your human soul is spelled differently.

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,000
S O L E.

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So you're talking about the one thing only.

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So my sole love.

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I only have one love.

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
My sole pair of shoes.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I only have one pair of shoes.

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So it's one thing.

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
One.

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But the sole purpose.

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So the only reason that this industry exists is what?

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
For monetary gain.

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So monetary monetary.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You might have heard of the International Monetary Fund.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Exactly.

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The IMF.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And so monetary refers to money.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Money.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
As the the door said, it's a gas.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And the gain, which means basically means making it to get more money.

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So that's the point that this person is making, that that the sole purpose of the gambling industry is to make money.

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ouch.

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So he's saying there's no other reason to gamble.

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
People are in this industry just to make money.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's greedy.

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Well, I mean, basically, you could probably say that almost about almost all the all the companies, right?

207
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What about education companies like ours?

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's different.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Education is very different.

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Absolutely.

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So what's another industry that has a sole purpose?

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
For example, nonprofit organizations.

213
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Their sole purpose is to help people.

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
All right.

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
OK, I can get into that.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, cool.

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So sole purpose and monetary gain.

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Very useful phrases.

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But let's take another listen to today's dialogue.

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And I put to you some of these great, great new words.

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Did you hear the state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city?

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Soon you're going to have amazing hotels and casinos here, which would be good for business.

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Are you serious?

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain.

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It disgusts me.

226
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What are you talking about?

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
How does it exploit people?

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, to begin with, gambling is addictive.

229
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupt communities.

230
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Once you're addicted, it's very difficult to stop.

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
People have lost their houses, cars and have been left out on the street after becoming addicted.

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling, most often because of the action and risk.

233
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for social interaction.

234
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Geez.

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea, although I have been to Las Vegas and I didn't become addicted or anything like that.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Now, excuse me.

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I have a protest rally to organize.

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
All right, so gambling, what are you what are your opinions about it?

241
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Pro gambling or anti gambling?

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
OK, well, here's the thing.

243
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Gambling is a sport and some it involves money, obviously, but people also don't I don't think should have other people telling them how to spend their money unless they have some kind of problem.

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Right.

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So the law doesn't get involved if you have a drinking problem until you're harmful to people around you.

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So I don't think that it's right for the for the government to be able to say, listen, you can't gamble because it's your own money.

247
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If it makes you happy, it makes you happy.

248
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Interesting.

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Now, we've seen very specific cities or places where you can actually gamble in this way.

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You have Monaco or Las Vegas or Macau more recently.

251
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Right.

252
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So very interesting cities or countries that have been built on the gambling industry, which apparently is a multibillion dollar industry.

253
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Absolutely.

254
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't know.

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What do you think?

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Are you against gambling?

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Are you for gambling?

258
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I mean, is it one of those things that you can really or do you maybe even like it?

259
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Maybe some people don't even really care for it.

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They don't find it fun to play blackjack or go to the play a round of poker or something like that.

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, that's their problem.

262
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I enjoy it.

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I think it's fun.

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I mean, as long as with anything you do it in moderation, that means you don't do it too much.

265
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I think it's OK.

266
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
All right.

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
