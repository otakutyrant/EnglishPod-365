00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:03,540
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,299
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:09,380
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking a little bit about food and about your health.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,179
That's right.

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we're going to take a look at our favorite, maybe, kind of food.

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:20,199
We're taking a look at the fast food, all these yummy but not very healthy types of food.

7
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:21,280
Yeah, we are.

8
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:28,320
So let's listen to our dialogue, and when we come back we'll be talking about what some of these foods are and what some of the phrases you've heard mean.

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,299
I'm hungry.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,859
Let's order up something to eat.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,259
Okay, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,979
I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries, and a chocolate sundae.

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,899
You eat too much junk food.

14
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:50,520
That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.

15
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,060
Well, I never seem to gain weight, so I don't mind.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,020
It's not only about getting fat or not.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,219
It's about being healthy.

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,439
You could really have some health problems later on.

19
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,340
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,560
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,099
You're a lost cause.

22
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,540
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at language takeaway.

23
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,079
Language takeaway.

24
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:21,540
So first up on language takeaway is a very unhealthy food.

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,219
I believe it's called a chocolate sundae.

26
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:23,959
That's right.

27
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:27,540
We wanted to order hamburger, french fries, and a chocolate sundae.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,760
So chocolate, we know that this is the flavor that comes from cocoa, but what is a sundae?

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,980
Well, basically, a sundae is a kind of ice cream dessert.

30
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:48,400
It comes in a cup or a bowl, and it's usually vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and then oftentimes a cherry on top.

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:57,319
So as you can see, the word is pronounced exactly like the day, sundae, but it has a different spelling in the end.

32
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,000
S-U-N-D-A-E, sundae.

33
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,859
So this is a chocolate sundae.

34
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,959
So when you see this spelling, a sundae with an E, that's the dessert.

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,860
If you see it with a Y, that's the day.

36
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,819
So chocolate sundae, actually a very delicious dessert, but remember it's ice cream.

37
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,620
That's right.

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,099
Now, all of these types of food, hamburger, chocolate sundae, it's called junk food.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,460
Junk food.

40
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:22,599
Well, food you know.

41
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:23,560
Junk.

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,620
What is an example of junk, Marco?

43
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,419
Well, something that's not good or useful anymore.

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,919
So maybe you have trash that you need to get rid of, like an old TV.

45
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:33,800
That's junk.

46
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,620
So my mom would always say, throw away this junk.

47
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,439
It's stuff that you don't need, so junk is things that you would throw away.

48
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,159
Junk food is the kind of food that's not healthy for you.

49
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,180
That's the food that you shouldn't eat, but it tends to be really delicious.

50
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,180
That's right.

51
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:58,120
So for example, the hamburger, french fries, a chocolate sundae, all this would fall under this category of junk food.

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,759
That's right.

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,479
And one of the things about junk food is that it's high in cholesterol.

54
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,120
Now what is cholesterol, Marco?

55
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:04,960
That's right.

56
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,280
So you always have to be careful.

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:18,419
Your doctor says that you shouldn't have, or you have to be careful about having high cholesterol, and that's just basically, it's a type of fat that is found in animal products.

58
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,080
So for example, beef has cholesterol, and it's dangerous because it could maybe cause health problems.

59
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:25,819
That's right.

60
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:36,319
So my friend needed to lower his cholesterol, and his doctor told him he should eat less red meat, eat more vegetables and fruits instead.

61
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:37,300
That's right.

62
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:46,500
So cholesterol is, you'll see it all the time when you're shopping, you'll see that it's low in cholesterol, or no sugar, or no calories, stuff like that.

63
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:47,120
Exactly.

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,979
Now a food that is very, very high in cholesterol is fried chicken, but it's also very delicious.

65
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:54,819
That's right.

66
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,800
Fried chicken.

67
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:03,819
Now as you see, the first word there is fried, and that means that it was cooked in hot oil.

68
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,819
That's right.

69
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:17,759
And what's important to remember about most American fried chicken is that the chicken is usually put in a batter, so like a milk, egg, flour sauce, and then it's fried.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,300
So on the outside it's very, very crispy and salty.

71
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:21,959
That's right.

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,319
So it's covered in like a type of bread, like a crispy bread.

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,259
Yeah, that's right.

74
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:38,939
It's usually very greasy, so when you eat it you have lots of grease on your fingers, but one of the reasons it tastes so good is because, as you say, Marco, it's fried in oil.

75
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,199
Mm-hmm, that's right.

76
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,339
Very good.

77
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,259
So this is all the vocab that we have for language takeaway.

78
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,920
Let's listen to the dialogue again.

79
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,839
I'm hungry.

80
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:55,379
Let's order up something to eat.

81
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,779
Okay, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.

82
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,519
I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries, and a chocolate sundae.

83
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,439
You eat too much junk food.

84
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,040
That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.

85
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,579
Well, I never seem to gain weight, so I don't mind.

86
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,540
It's not only about getting fat or not.

87
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,740
It's about being healthy.

88
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,000
You could really have some health problems later on.

89
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,860
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

90
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,160
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

91
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,600
You're a lost cause.

92
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:30,920
All right, now it's time for some phrases on Fluency Builder.

93
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,819
Fluency Builder.

94
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:43,360
So one of the first phrases is actually something that I'm excited to talk about because it comes up a lot in directions when we're giving people directions somewhere.

95
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,560
So one of the people in the dialogue said, we can order a soup and salad from the restaurant down the street.

96
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:51,100
Right.

97
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:54,579
So this is, you're basically telling the person where the restaurant is.

98
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:59,939
And when you say something is down the street, it means that it's nearby.

99
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:00,839
It is.

100
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:01,500
It's nearby.

101
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,439
It's on the same street or it's just a few minutes walk from where you are now.

102
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,139
Right, right.

103
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,819
So you can say, my apartment is just down the street from this park.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,139
So it's very close.

105
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,079
Or you could say, I know him.

106
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:20,800
He lived down the street from me when we were children.

107
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,259
Okay, so he lived really, really close to you.

108
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,399
Very good.

109
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:34,639
Now, when we were talking about junk food and we were talking about how it's not healthy, we said that junk food clogs up your arteries.

110
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:35,720
All right.

111
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:39,399
A couple of important words here to clog up arteries.

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,439
The verb to clog.

113
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,379
What does that mean?

114
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,800
Clog with a G.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,560
It means it gets in the way or obstructs it.

116
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,379
All right.

117
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:56,819
So for example, if a drain, in my sink, if a drain is clogged, the water does not go down.

118
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:57,160
Right.

119
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,680
So the water starts to build and build and build.

120
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,519
Actually it's very dangerous because if it comes up too much, the water will go on the floor.

121
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,500
But that's a drain.

122
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,120
That's a sink.

123
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,980
If you're talking about the heart, you would say that cholesterol clogs up your arteries.

124
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,160
So your arteries are like these tubes where blood passes.

125
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:20,920
And of course if they're clogged up, then blood can't pass.

126
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,699
That's right.

127
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:33,060
And if it's very serious, people sometimes have to have heart surgery to clear those arteries to take the blockage, the clogging away from the arteries.

128
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,720
That's right.

129
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,259
That's right.

130
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:34,899
Okay.

131
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:39,220
So that is to clog something up or something is clogged up.

132
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:46,819
Now moving on, when we were giving suggestions, we said, all right, well how about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

133
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,040
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

134
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:50,899
All right.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,720
Now this is a great phrase, as you say, Marco, for offering a suggestion.

136
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,220
You could say, I think we should eat hamburgers.

137
00:07:58,699 --> 00:07:59,240
Better yet.

138
00:07:59,720 --> 00:07:59,939
Okay.

139
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:00,579
So what does this mean?

140
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,980
This means I actually had a better idea while I was telling you my other idea.

141
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,819
So it can be used in the middle of a sentence like here, right?

142
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,360
It's kind of like an interjection.

143
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,019
Better yet.

144
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,579
You know what?

145
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,399
Let's get some pizza.

146
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,240
So it's better than the idea you just had.

147
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
So let's go swimming.

148
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,720
Oh, better yet, let's go play basketball.

149
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,319
Right.

150
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,139
Exactly.

151
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:28,160
Now towards the end, our friend said, you know what?

152
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,279
You're a lost cause.

153
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,240
What does that mean?

154
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,060
What does this phrase mean?

155
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
You're a lost cause.

156
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,500
You're a lost cause.

157
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,000
It's an interesting phrase.

158
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,559
This is basically a way of saying I can do nothing to change you.

159
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:49,440
You have a bad habit or you have this bad quality and anything I do, it's not going to help.

160
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,940
So something that is a lost cause, it means it's hopeless, helpless.

161
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,820
That's right.

162
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,080
I cannot do anything to change it.

163
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:57,659
Okay.

164
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,600
All right.

165
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,120
A lot of great vocab here.

166
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,539
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

167
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,299
I'm hungry.

168
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:10,860
Let's order up something to eat.

169
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,240
Okay, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.

170
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,960
I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries, and a chocolate sundae.

171
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,899
You eat too much junk food.

172
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,500
That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.

173
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,039
Well, I never seem to gain weight, so I don't mind.

174
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,200
It's not only about getting fat or not, it's about being healthy.

175
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,379
You could really have some health problems later on.

176
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,320
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

177
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,559
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

178
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:38,779
Hot dogs.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,139
You're a lost cause.

180
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
All right.

181
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:47,480
So talking about junk food, we took a look at cholesterol.

182
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:51,440
Now apparently not all cholesterol is bad.

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,379
That's right.

184
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,860
There are two kinds of cholesterol, HDLs and LDLs, and one kind is good for you and the other kind is bad for you.

185
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:06,460
And so it's important when you talk to your doctor, you ask your doctor if the bad cholesterol is high for you.

186
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,840
Because if it's the good cholesterol that's high, you're probably not going to experience health problems.

187
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,399
But if you have really high bad cholesterol, then that's something that you should think about when you eat and when you choose the kinds of foods that you eat.

188
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:18,940
Right.

189
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:27,059
So usually my doctor always used to tell me to not eat so many eggs because eggs are high in cholesterol.

190
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,759
That's right.

191
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,440
Red meat and eggs and salty foods, I think.

192
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:38,220
But generally speaking, I think it's good just to eat a lot of vegetables and to balance out your diet.

193
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,519
So vegetables don't really even have cholesterol.

194
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:47,600
No, they're low in cholesterol and I think they also have a lot of vitamins and minerals that your body needs.

195
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:56,919
It's very, very interesting because actually all food that is usually very, very delicious is high in cholesterol or high in calories.

196
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:57,700
It's bad for you.

197
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,779
It's basically junk food.

198
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,139
Yeah.

199
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:08,960
So potato chips, hot dogs, pizza, fried chicken, all of these delicious foods, they're all considered junk food and they're all really bad for you.

200
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:09,639
That's right.

201
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,200
All right.

202
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,799
A very interesting topic now.

203
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,580
There are certain local types of junk food that people consider to be junk food.

204
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,740
For example, if you go maybe to the Middle East, you'll have the wraps that could be considered a type of junk food.

205
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,240
I guess.

206
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:24,600
Yeah.

207
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,399
Because it's fast, it's greasy.

208
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:27,519
It is pretty greasy.

209
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,240
It's delicious.

210
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,480
Like a shawarma wrap.

211
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:29,919
Exactly.

212
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,059
So maybe you can let us know what local type of junk food you have.

213
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,480
This is mostly American burgers, fries, hot dogs.

214
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,679
What is it in your country?

215
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:39,659
Let us know.

216
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,820
