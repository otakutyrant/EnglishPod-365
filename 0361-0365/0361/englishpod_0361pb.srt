00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking a little bit about food and about your health.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we're going to take a look at our favorite, maybe, kind of food.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're taking a look at the fast food, all these yummy but not very healthy types of food.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, we are.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So let's listen to our dialogue, and when we come back we'll be talking about what some of these foods are and what some of the phrases you've heard mean.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm hungry.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's order up something to eat.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries, and a chocolate sundae.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You eat too much junk food.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, I never seem to gain weight, so I don't mind.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's not only about getting fat or not.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's about being healthy.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You could really have some health problems later on.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You're a lost cause.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at language takeaway.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Language takeaway.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So first up on language takeaway is a very unhealthy food.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I believe it's called a chocolate sundae.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's right.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We wanted to order hamburger, french fries, and a chocolate sundae.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So chocolate, we know that this is the flavor that comes from cocoa, but what is a sundae?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, basically, a sundae is a kind of ice cream dessert.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It comes in a cup or a bowl, and it's usually vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and then oftentimes a cherry on top.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So as you can see, the word is pronounced exactly like the day, sundae, but it has a different spelling in the end.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
S-U-N-D-A-E, sundae.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So this is a chocolate sundae.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So when you see this spelling, a sundae with an E, that's the dessert.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you see it with a Y, that's the day.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So chocolate sundae, actually a very delicious dessert, but remember it's ice cream.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's right.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now, all of these types of food, hamburger, chocolate sundae, it's called junk food.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Junk food.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, food you know.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Junk.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What is an example of junk, Marco?

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, something that's not good or useful anymore.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So maybe you have trash that you need to get rid of, like an old TV.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's junk.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So my mom would always say, throw away this junk.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's stuff that you don't need, so junk is things that you would throw away.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Junk food is the kind of food that's not healthy for you.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's the food that you shouldn't eat, but it tends to be really delicious.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's right.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So for example, the hamburger, french fries, a chocolate sundae, all this would fall under this category of junk food.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's right.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And one of the things about junk food is that it's high in cholesterol.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now what is cholesterol, Marco?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's right.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So you always have to be careful.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Your doctor says that you shouldn't have, or you have to be careful about having high cholesterol, and that's just basically, it's a type of fat that is found in animal products.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So for example, beef has cholesterol, and it's dangerous because it could maybe cause health problems.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's right.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So my friend needed to lower his cholesterol, and his doctor told him he should eat less red meat, eat more vegetables and fruits instead.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's right.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So cholesterol is, you'll see it all the time when you're shopping, you'll see that it's low in cholesterol, or no sugar, or no calories, stuff like that.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Exactly.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Now a food that is very, very high in cholesterol is fried chicken, but it's also very delicious.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's right.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Fried chicken.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now as you see, the first word there is fried, and that means that it was cooked in hot oil.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's right.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And what's important to remember about most American fried chicken is that the chicken is usually put in a batter, so like a milk, egg, flour sauce, and then it's fried.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So on the outside it's very, very crispy and salty.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So it's covered in like a type of bread, like a crispy bread.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, that's right.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's usually very greasy, so when you eat it you have lots of grease on your fingers, but one of the reasons it tastes so good is because, as you say, Marco, it's fried in oil.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Mm-hmm, that's right.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Very good.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So this is all the vocab that we have for language takeaway.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm hungry.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's order up something to eat.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries, and a chocolate sundae.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You eat too much junk food.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Well, I never seem to gain weight, so I don't mind.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's not only about getting fat or not.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's about being healthy.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You could really have some health problems later on.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're a lost cause.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
All right, now it's time for some phrases on Fluency Builder.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Fluency Builder.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So one of the first phrases is actually something that I'm excited to talk about because it comes up a lot in directions when we're giving people directions somewhere.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So one of the people in the dialogue said, we can order a soup and salad from the restaurant down the street.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Right.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So this is, you're basically telling the person where the restaurant is.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And when you say something is down the street, it means that it's nearby.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It is.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's nearby.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's on the same street or it's just a few minutes walk from where you are now.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Right, right.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So you can say, my apartment is just down the street from this park.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So it's very close.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Or you could say, I know him.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He lived down the street from me when we were children.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, so he lived really, really close to you.

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Very good.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Now, when we were talking about junk food and we were talking about how it's not healthy, we said that junk food clogs up your arteries.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
All right.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
A couple of important words here to clog up arteries.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The verb to clog.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What does that mean?

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Clog with a G.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It means it gets in the way or obstructs it.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,000
All right.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So for example, if a drain, in my sink, if a drain is clogged, the water does not go down.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Right.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So the water starts to build and build and build.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Actually it's very dangerous because if it comes up too much, the water will go on the floor.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But that's a drain.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's a sink.

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If you're talking about the heart, you would say that cholesterol clogs up your arteries.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So your arteries are like these tubes where blood passes.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And of course if they're clogged up, then blood can't pass.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's right.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And if it's very serious, people sometimes have to have heart surgery to clear those arteries to take the blockage, the clogging away from the arteries.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's right.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's right.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So that is to clog something up or something is clogged up.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Now moving on, when we were giving suggestions, we said, all right, well how about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
All right.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Now this is a great phrase, as you say, Marco, for offering a suggestion.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You could say, I think we should eat hamburgers.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Better yet.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So what does this mean?

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This means I actually had a better idea while I was telling you my other idea.

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So it can be used in the middle of a sentence like here, right?

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's kind of like an interjection.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Better yet.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You know what?

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's get some pizza.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So it's better than the idea you just had.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So let's go swimming.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, better yet, let's go play basketball.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Right.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Exactly.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Now towards the end, our friend said, you know what?

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're a lost cause.

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What does that mean?

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What does this phrase mean?

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're a lost cause.

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're a lost cause.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's an interesting phrase.

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is basically a way of saying I can do nothing to change you.

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You have a bad habit or you have this bad quality and anything I do, it's not going to help.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So something that is a lost cause, it means it's hopeless, helpless.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's right.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I cannot do anything to change it.

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
All right.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
A lot of great vocab here.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm hungry.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's order up something to eat.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries, and a chocolate sundae.

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You eat too much junk food.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Well, I never seem to gain weight, so I don't mind.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's not only about getting fat or not, it's about being healthy.

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You could really have some health problems later on.

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hot dogs.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're a lost cause.

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
All right.

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So talking about junk food, we took a look at cholesterol.

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Now apparently not all cholesterol is bad.

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's right.

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There are two kinds of cholesterol, HDLs and LDLs, and one kind is good for you and the other kind is bad for you.

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And so it's important when you talk to your doctor, you ask your doctor if the bad cholesterol is high for you.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Because if it's the good cholesterol that's high, you're probably not going to experience health problems.

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But if you have really high bad cholesterol, then that's something that you should think about when you eat and when you choose the kinds of foods that you eat.

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Right.

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So usually my doctor always used to tell me to not eat so many eggs because eggs are high in cholesterol.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Red meat and eggs and salty foods, I think.

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But generally speaking, I think it's good just to eat a lot of vegetables and to balance out your diet.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So vegetables don't really even have cholesterol.

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No, they're low in cholesterol and I think they also have a lot of vitamins and minerals that your body needs.

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's very, very interesting because actually all food that is usually very, very delicious is high in cholesterol or high in calories.

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's bad for you.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's basically junk food.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So potato chips, hot dogs, pizza, fried chicken, all of these delicious foods, they're all considered junk food and they're all really bad for you.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's right.

201
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
All right.

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
A very interesting topic now.

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There are certain local types of junk food that people consider to be junk food.

204
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
For example, if you go maybe to the Middle East, you'll have the wraps that could be considered a type of junk food.

205
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I guess.

206
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Because it's fast, it's greasy.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It is pretty greasy.

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's delicious.

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Like a shawarma wrap.

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Exactly.

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So maybe you can let us know what local type of junk food you have.

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This is mostly American burgers, fries, hot dogs.

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What is it in your country?

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Let us know.

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.
