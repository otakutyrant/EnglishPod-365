00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:07,780
EnglishPod.com I'm hungry.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,359
Let's order up something to eat.

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:10,199
Okay.

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:13,740
Maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,460
I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries, and a chocolate sundae.

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,399
You eat too much junk food.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,019
That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,539
Well, I never seem to gain weight, so I don't mind.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,500
It's not only about getting fat or not.

10
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:28,719
It's about being healthy.

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,920
You could really have some health problems later on.

12
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:34,820
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,119
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,539
You're a lost cause.
