00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com I'm hungry.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's order up something to eat.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries, and a chocolate sundae.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You eat too much junk food.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, I never seem to gain weight, so I don't mind.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's not only about getting fat or not.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's about being healthy.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You could really have some health problems later on.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You're a lost cause.
