00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and today we are cleaning, right, Marco?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today we are cleaning our house.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's not one of our favorite activities, but we have to do it.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And so we're going to take a look at a lot of great vocab related to, you know, household chores.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Kevin, what is this mess?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It looks like a pigsty in here.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Clean this up.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, Dad.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will do it in a minute.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let me just finish this level of this game.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No, I said now, plus you are grounded.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're not allowed to play video games.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want you to make your bed, do the laundry, and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's so unfair.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You have to pull your weight around here, young man.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My house, my rules.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture, and vacuumed the rugs.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So today on Language Takeaway, let's take a look at all the verbs and all the ways that we have to clean the house.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So starting with the first one, we have to make the bed.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Make your bed.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Make your bed.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, so this might sound quite strange because the verb to make is something we say for a lot of different things, like make a deal.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Make a mistake.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Make a mistake.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But here we're making the bed.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That means we're putting the pillows on top of the bed, and we're going to make sure the blanket is even.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So when you get out of bed, if everything is very messy, when you make it, you put everything in order on your bed.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's right.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's right.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And it's also confusing because our next verb is to do the laundry.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All right, so you make your bed, but you do the laundry.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The laundry here means you clean the dirty clothes.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Right, right.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So this is one of the very, I would say, confusing parts of English where it's kind of confusing when to use the verb make, when to use the verb do.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So usually you make a mistake, as we say, or you make a cake, but you do your homework.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So in these cases, you just kind of have to memorize that you make the bed, but you do the laundry.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Exactly.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So this is very common, actually, to do the laundry.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I have to go do the laundry today because it's an event.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You know, you have to gather your clothes and put in the detergent and wash it and dry it.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So just remember, make the bed, do the laundry, but then how do we clean those floors?

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
All right, so the floor, we have to do two things.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We sweep the floors.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So the verb there is to sweep.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And how do you sweep?

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You actually use a broom to sweep.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So the broom is like a straw, it's like a brush almost that you use on the floor, and you collect all of the hair and the dust and these things, and you put it into the garbage bin.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But after you sweep, then you need to use water to clean because, obviously, sweeping is just for dry things.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Mopping is actually how you clean with water and soap.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All right, so now the verb there is to mop the floors.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And usually you use water, you use soap, and you use a mop.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So you use a mop to mop.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Exactly.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The verb is to mop.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The noun, the object, is a mop, like you say.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So I'm going to mop the floors, right?

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So please don't come into the kitchen.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Right, okay.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And, well, now we need to clean the furniture, and usually on the furniture we have a lot of dust.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So we need to dust the furniture.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
To dust.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
To dust.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, this is something we don't use for the floors, really, because we have this great verb to sweep.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But with furniture and things like that, we say to dust, and this means we're going to collect the dust off of the piano or the sofa or the table.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Right, exactly.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And now the floors we clean, the furniture we clean, but sometimes we have rugs or we have carpet in our house, usually in the bedrooms, or we have a large rug in the living room, and we need to clean that as well, but we don't really mop it, we don't sweep it.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's best to vacuum it.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
All right, so the verb is to vacuum, and what is the noun, the thing we use?

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
A vacuum cleaner.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A vacuum cleaner, or just simply a vacuum.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Now this is something that uses air to suck up all of the dirt and garbage, so it goes and it sucks up all of that bad stuff, and so we don't have to dust it, and obviously with carpet we can't really use water, so this is a great tool for cleaning fabric like carpets and rugs.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Very good.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So that's all the ways that we can basically, the verbs that we use to clean around the house.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Looks like a pigsty in here.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Clean this up.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay, Dad.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will do it in a minute.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let me just finish this level of this game.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, I said now, plus you are grounded.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're not allowed to play video games.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I want you to make your bed, do the laundry, and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's so unfair.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You have to pull your weight around here, young man.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
My house, my rules.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture, and vacuumed the rugs.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
All right, so now let's take a look at some phrases, three of them, on Fluency Builder.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Fluency Builder.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
All right, now the first word here is pigsty.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The dad says, Kevin, it looks like a pigsty in here.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Clean this up.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Right, so a pigsty.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It looks like a pigsty.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now, a pigsty is where pigs live, right?

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's right.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So is it really a pigsty?

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's not really a pigsty.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There are no pigs living there, but to say that a room is like a pigsty means that it's very, very, very dirty.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Right, that it looks almost like the mud and the dirty place where pigs live.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Exactly, so he's saying you're living in a dirty room.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You need to clean this.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Right, so a room or a house will look like a pigsty.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Now, the dad is actually making him do a lot of work because he says the kid is grounded.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're grounded.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You're not allowed to play video games.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Now, a parent will ground a child, it's a verb, when the child does something bad.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So maybe the child gets very, very bad grades at school and the parent says, you're grounded for one week.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That means you can't go out.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can't play video games.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
There are different rules in every family, but to say you're grounded means you're being punished for something.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Right, so the verb is to ground, and you can also be grounded, and if you're grounded, you can say, I'm sorry, I can't go out today.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm grounded.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Exactly, so to be grounded is not a fun situation, but obviously the father is saying, listen, you're grounded.

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You have time to do all of this work.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Right, and well, this is something that my dad used to say to me, well, you have to pull your weight around here, so you have to pull your weight around here.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What does that mean?

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
To pull your weight.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, you think about it.

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If you're not carrying yourself, someone else is carrying you, that means that they're doing more work than they should be, so you're basically being asked to do your part, to be responsible for yourself so that other people, like your mom and dad, don't have to be responsible for you.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Right, so you have to help out and collaborate.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Exactly, so say there's three people, mom, dad, and a son.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If mom does all the cleaning, all the cooking, all the washing, then the other two, they're not pulling their weight, so she says, pull your weight, do some cleaning, do some washing.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Right, so if your mom cooks and then you wash the dishes, then you are pulling your weight.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're helping.

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You're helping out, exactly.

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
All right, a lot of great stuff.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Kevin, what is this mess?

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It looks like a pigsty in here.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Clean this up.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay, dad, I will do it in a minute.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let me just finish this level of this game.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No, I said now.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Plus you are grounded.

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're not allowed to play video games.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I want you to make your bed, do the laundry, and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's so unfair.

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You have to pull your weight around here, young man.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
My house, my rules.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture, and vacuumed the rugs.

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay, very good.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So doing household chores, not a fun thing, but also being grounded.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why do we consider chores to be kind of like a punishment?

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Well, there's punishment where you sit alone in your room and you think about your actions, and then there's punishment that's more proactive.

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Mom and dad say, okay, well, he's grounded.

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's have him work.

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Let's make him do something.

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's make him do something so that, you know, we're benefiting from his punishment.

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think it's also good when children are grounded because it makes them realize that, you know, they need to help out around the house, that it's this work.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It doesn't get done magically.

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There's actually someone doing it.

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Right, and it's not like, well, in many cases in many countries, people will have, like we saw in our previous lesson, a domestic maid, a cleaning lady, that will usually do everything, so maybe the kid will become very comfortable and not really do anything.

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Or very lazy.

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Very lazy.

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Even worse, yes.

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So I definitely remember in my house we had chores, because when it's not punishment, when it's your parents' expectation normally, that's called a chore.

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And they say, okay, Catherine, your chores this week, you need to take the garbage outside, you need to wash the dishes, and you need to make your bed every day.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And then maybe my brother had to help cook and clean the floor, mop the floors and sweep, so we have different chores.

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I guess this is more common, especially if both parents work and everyone is collaborating or pulling their weight in the house, and if you don't have a cleaning lady, for example.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Exactly.

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Very interesting topic.

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, that's all the time we have for today.

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
