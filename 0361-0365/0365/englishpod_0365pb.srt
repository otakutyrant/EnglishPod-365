00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,859
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:04,599
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,460
My name is Catherine, and today we are cleaning, right, Marco?

4
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:09,259
That's right.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,800
Today we are cleaning our house.

6
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,279
It's not one of our favorite activities, but we have to do it.

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:20,359
And so we're going to take a look at a lot of great vocab related to, you know, household chores.

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:20,980
That's right.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,760
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,579
Kevin, what is this mess?

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,359
It looks like a pigsty in here.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,479
Clean this up.

13
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:34,880
Okay, Dad.

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,100
I will do it in a minute.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,920
Let me just finish this level of this game.

16
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,740
No, I said now, plus you are grounded.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,399
You're not allowed to play video games.

18
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,979
I want you to make your bed, do the laundry, and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,619
That's so unfair.

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,079
You have to pull your weight around here, young man.

21
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,899
My house, my rules.

22
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,880
But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture, and vacuumed the rugs.

23
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:00,100
That's great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,819
So today on Language Takeaway, let's take a look at all the verbs and all the ways that we have to clean the house.

25
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:12,180
So starting with the first one, we have to make the bed.

26
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,299
Make your bed.

27
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,719
Make your bed.

28
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:21,459
Okay, so this might sound quite strange because the verb to make is something we say for a lot of different things, like make a deal.

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,120
Make a mistake.

30
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:22,780
Make a mistake.

31
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,459
But here we're making the bed.

32
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:30,980
That means we're putting the pillows on top of the bed, and we're going to make sure the blanket is even.

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,480
So when you get out of bed, if everything is very messy, when you make it, you put everything in order on your bed.

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:37,780
That's right.

35
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,359
That's right.

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,280
And it's also confusing because our next verb is to do the laundry.

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,939
All right, so you make your bed, but you do the laundry.

38
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,560
The laundry here means you clean the dirty clothes.

39
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,359
Right, right.

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:02,840
So this is one of the very, I would say, confusing parts of English where it's kind of confusing when to use the verb make, when to use the verb do.

41
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:10,639
So usually you make a mistake, as we say, or you make a cake, but you do your homework.

42
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,900
So in these cases, you just kind of have to memorize that you make the bed, but you do the laundry.

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,419
Exactly.

44
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,419
So this is very common, actually, to do the laundry.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,639
I have to go do the laundry today because it's an event.

46
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:30,560
You know, you have to gather your clothes and put in the detergent and wash it and dry it.

47
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,759
So just remember, make the bed, do the laundry, but then how do we clean those floors?

48
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,300
All right, so the floor, we have to do two things.

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,120
We sweep the floors.

50
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,199
So the verb there is to sweep.

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,300
And how do you sweep?

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,199
You actually use a broom to sweep.

53
00:02:48,759 --> 00:03:00,680
So the broom is like a straw, it's like a brush almost that you use on the floor, and you collect all of the hair and the dust and these things, and you put it into the garbage bin.

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,159
But after you sweep, then you need to use water to clean because, obviously, sweeping is just for dry things.

55
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,259
Mopping is actually how you clean with water and soap.

56
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,840
That's right.

57
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,740
All right, so now the verb there is to mop the floors.

58
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,039
And usually you use water, you use soap, and you use a mop.

59
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,460
So you use a mop to mop.

60
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,060
Exactly.

61
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,539
The verb is to mop.

62
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,039
The noun, the object, is a mop, like you say.

63
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,139
So I'm going to mop the floors, right?

64
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,360
So please don't come into the kitchen.

65
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,060
Right, okay.

66
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:40,639
And, well, now we need to clean the furniture, and usually on the furniture we have a lot of dust.

67
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,240
So we need to dust the furniture.

68
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:43,900
To dust.

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,860
To dust.

70
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,460
Yeah, this is something we don't use for the floors, really, because we have this great verb to sweep.

71
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:58,280
But with furniture and things like that, we say to dust, and this means we're going to collect the dust off of the piano or the sofa or the table.

72
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,379
Right, exactly.

73
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:16,199
And now the floors we clean, the furniture we clean, but sometimes we have rugs or we have carpet in our house, usually in the bedrooms, or we have a large rug in the living room, and we need to clean that as well, but we don't really mop it, we don't sweep it.

74
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,399
It's best to vacuum it.

75
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,360
All right, so the verb is to vacuum, and what is the noun, the thing we use?

76
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,459
A vacuum cleaner.

77
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,180
A vacuum cleaner, or just simply a vacuum.

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:45,579
Now this is something that uses air to suck up all of the dirt and garbage, so it goes and it sucks up all of that bad stuff, and so we don't have to dust it, and obviously with carpet we can't really use water, so this is a great tool for cleaning fabric like carpets and rugs.

79
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,459
Very good.

80
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,660
So that's all the ways that we can basically, the verbs that we use to clean around the house.

81
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,220
Let's listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

82
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,899
Looks like a pigsty in here.

83
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:05,939
Clean this up.

84
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,439
Okay, Dad.

85
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:08,620
I will do it in a minute.

86
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,439
Let me just finish this level of this game.

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,279
No, I said now, plus you are grounded.

88
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,920
You're not allowed to play video games.

89
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,540
I want you to make your bed, do the laundry, and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.

90
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,160
That's so unfair.

91
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,620
You have to pull your weight around here, young man.

92
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,379
My house, my rules.

93
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,399
But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture, and vacuumed the rugs.

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,360
That's great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.

95
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,180
All right, so now let's take a look at some phrases, three of them, on Fluency Builder.

96
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,959
Fluency Builder.

97
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,800
All right, now the first word here is pigsty.

98
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,360
The dad says, Kevin, it looks like a pigsty in here.

99
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,620
Clean this up.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,220
Right, so a pigsty.

101
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:53,199
It looks like a pigsty.

102
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,959
Now, a pigsty is where pigs live, right?

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,300
That's right.

104
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,279
So is it really a pigsty?

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,079
It's not really a pigsty.

106
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:07,339
There are no pigs living there, but to say that a room is like a pigsty means that it's very, very, very dirty.

107
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,519
Right, that it looks almost like the mud and the dirty place where pigs live.

108
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,199
Exactly, so he's saying you're living in a dirty room.

109
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,339
You need to clean this.

110
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,399
Right, so a room or a house will look like a pigsty.

111
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,759
Now, the dad is actually making him do a lot of work because he says the kid is grounded.

112
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,339
You're grounded.

113
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,620
You're not allowed to play video games.

114
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:40,379
Now, a parent will ground a child, it's a verb, when the child does something bad.

115
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:48,879
So maybe the child gets very, very bad grades at school and the parent says, you're grounded for one week.

116
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,339
That means you can't go out.

117
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,839
You can't play video games.

118
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:59,199
There are different rules in every family, but to say you're grounded means you're being punished for something.

119
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:07,220
Right, so the verb is to ground, and you can also be grounded, and if you're grounded, you can say, I'm sorry, I can't go out today.

120
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:07,879
I'm grounded.

121
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:15,540
Exactly, so to be grounded is not a fun situation, but obviously the father is saying, listen, you're grounded.

122
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,000
You have time to do all of this work.

123
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:26,759
Right, and well, this is something that my dad used to say to me, well, you have to pull your weight around here, so you have to pull your weight around here.

124
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:27,300
What does that mean?

125
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,639
To pull your weight.

126
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,920
Well, you think about it.

127
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:47,600
If you're not carrying yourself, someone else is carrying you, that means that they're doing more work than they should be, so you're basically being asked to do your part, to be responsible for yourself so that other people, like your mom and dad, don't have to be responsible for you.

128
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,180
Right, so you have to help out and collaborate.

129
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,560
Exactly, so say there's three people, mom, dad, and a son.

130
00:07:56,119 --> 00:08:05,779
If mom does all the cleaning, all the cooking, all the washing, then the other two, they're not pulling their weight, so she says, pull your weight, do some cleaning, do some washing.

131
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,000
Right, so if your mom cooks and then you wash the dishes, then you are pulling your weight.

132
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,560
You're helping.

133
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,060
You're helping out, exactly.

134
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,839
All right, a lot of great stuff.

135
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,759
Let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.

136
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,579
Kevin, what is this mess?

137
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,379
It looks like a pigsty in here.

138
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,420
Clean this up.

139
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,100
Okay, dad, I will do it in a minute.

140
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,919
Let me just finish this level of this game.

141
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,340
No, I said now.

142
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,759
Plus you are grounded.

143
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,399
You're not allowed to play video games.

144
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,980
I want you to make your bed, do the laundry, and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.

145
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,639
That's so unfair.

146
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,080
You have to pull your weight around here, young man.

147
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,879
My house, my rules.

148
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:51,879
But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture, and vacuumed the rugs.

149
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,259
That's great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.

150
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,620
Okay, very good.

151
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,620
So doing household chores, not a fun thing, but also being grounded.

152
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,059
Why do we consider chores to be kind of like a punishment?

153
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,899
Well, there's punishment where you sit alone in your room and you think about your actions, and then there's punishment that's more proactive.

154
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,940
Mom and dad say, okay, well, he's grounded.

155
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,159
Let's have him work.

156
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,779
Let's make him do something.

157
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,799
Let's make him do something so that, you know, we're benefiting from his punishment.

158
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:33,639
I think it's also good when children are grounded because it makes them realize that, you know, they need to help out around the house, that it's this work.

159
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,159
It doesn't get done magically.

160
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,720
There's actually someone doing it.

161
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:54,139
Right, and it's not like, well, in many cases in many countries, people will have, like we saw in our previous lesson, a domestic maid, a cleaning lady, that will usually do everything, so maybe the kid will become very comfortable and not really do anything.

162
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,080
Or very lazy.

163
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,580
Very lazy.

164
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,460
Even worse, yes.

165
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:06,080
So I definitely remember in my house we had chores, because when it's not punishment, when it's your parents' expectation normally, that's called a chore.

166
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:14,480
And they say, okay, Catherine, your chores this week, you need to take the garbage outside, you need to wash the dishes, and you need to make your bed every day.

167
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:23,779
And then maybe my brother had to help cook and clean the floor, mop the floors and sweep, so we have different chores.

168
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:34,679
And I guess this is more common, especially if both parents work and everyone is collaborating or pulling their weight in the house, and if you don't have a cleaning lady, for example.

169
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,179
Exactly.

170
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,820
Very interesting topic.

171
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,879
Well, that's all the time we have for today.
