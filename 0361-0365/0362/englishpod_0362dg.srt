00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Are you okay?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You seem a bit anxious.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, I'm okay.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, it's weird.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For example, just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Even though there was really no reason to feel that way.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, brave and hopeful.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I hope you're right.
