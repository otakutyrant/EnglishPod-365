00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,620
EnglishPod.com Are you okay?

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,099
You seem a bit anxious.

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:10,599
Yeah, I'm okay.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,800
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,460
I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.

00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,500
So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,579
Yeah, it's weird.

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,239
For example, just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely.

9
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,960
Even though there was really no reason to feel that way.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,280
Well, maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, brave and hopeful.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,420
I hope you're right.
