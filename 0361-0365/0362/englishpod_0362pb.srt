00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,700
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,459
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:06,559
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:07,960
What's wrong, Catherine?

5
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:11,240
I'm just a little down today.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,400
You're having a...

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,179
You're mood.

8
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:15,259
You're not in the mood today?

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:15,800
Is that what's going on?

10
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,039
I am not in the mood to record today.

11
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,160
Actually, no, I am in the mood.

12
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,160
So we're talking about moods, feelings, emotions.

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,679
This is today's podcast, and we're going to be learning a lot of the names for different kinds of feelings.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,340
That's right, so you're going to learn how to describe what mood you're in.

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,659
Maybe you're in a good mood, bad mood, etc.

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,140
So let's just jump into the dialogue and see what's going on.

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,780
Are you okay?

18
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,200
You seem a bit anxious.

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,759
Yeah, I'm okay.

20
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,939
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.

21
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:56,619
I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.

22
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,619
So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?

23
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:01,719
Yeah, it's weird.

24
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:08,180
For example, just this morning, I was feeling detached and lonely, even though there was really no reason to feel that way.

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,400
Well, maybe your mood will swing positively, and you will feel confident, brave, and hopeful.

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,560
I hope you're right.

27
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,900
Okay, lots of feelings.

28
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,620
So many feelings, in fact, that we're going to talk about the names of them in today's language takeaway.

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,420
Language takeaway.

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,840
So on language takeaway, let's take a look at this adjective.

31
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,760
You are feeling or you seem a little bit anxious.

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:37,900
Anxious.

33
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,939
He is anxious.

34
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,379
I feel anxious.

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,060
That's right.

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,260
Now this word means that you're feeling nervous or uneasy about something.

37
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:54,359
Normally when you feel anxious about something like a test, all you can think about is the test, right?

38
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,540
Oh, will I fail?

39
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,920
What's gonna happen?

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,099
Did I study enough?

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,939
You're worried.

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,840
So this is an anxious feeling.

43
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:01,599
That's right.

44
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:06,019
So if you're anxious, you're worried about something or you're nervous about something.

45
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,479
It could be about your job, interview, a test, etc.

46
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,319
Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,800
All right, so moving on now.

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,379
We're feeling anxious, but then we also feel a different type of excitement.

49
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:18,620
We are ecstatic.

50
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,520
All right, so while anxious is a bad feeling, ecstatic is a really good feeling.

51
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,139
Okay.

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,159
Okay, so I'm happy.

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,259
I'm really happy.

54
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,219
I'm ecstatic!

55
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,240
That's a really, really, really happy feeling.

56
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,020
Okay, so if you're ecstatic, it means you're very, very happy.

57
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,319
So it's not a negative thing.

58
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,460
No, so when I get a hundred percent on my test, I'm ecstatic.

59
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,560
I'm really happy.

60
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,080
Okay, now the, basically the complete opposite of being ecstatic would be to feel or be blue.

61
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:51,919
Yeah, this might seem a bit strange because blue is a color, as you know, B-L-U-E.

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,919
But when you're feeling blue, it means that you're feeling sad or down or upset.

63
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,400
You feel depressed.

64
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,159
Yeah.

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,039
So maybe this is why you also have the music, the blues, right?

66
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,020
The blues.

67
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,479
He's got the blues.

68
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,659
That means he's sad about something, usually a woman.

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,599
Uh-huh, okay, so ecstatic, very, very happy, feeling blue, very, very sad.

70
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:21,419
And, well, another example of feelings, also a negative one, is if you feel detached.

71
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,020
Detached.

72
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,759
All right, so we know the word attach.

73
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,939
That means to put two things together.

74
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:30,759
Well, detached means to take two things apart.

75
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,960
Okay, so what do you feel apart from?

76
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,860
Other people.

77
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,120
Uh-huh, okay.

78
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,080
So, for example, if I'm feeling detached, maybe it means that I don't feel like the people around me understand me.

79
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,180
I don't want to talk to other people.

80
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:46,419
I'm just not feeling very social.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,860
So, for example, can you feel detached in your relationship?

82
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,259
You can, and that's actually a really bad feeling because you should be happy in a relationship.

83
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,520
But when you're detached, it means that you don't really feel close to your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife.

84
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,460
Okay, and we feel detached and lonely.

85
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,659
So, if you feel lonely, that means that you feel?

86
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,219
Similar to detached, lonely means that you don't feel like you can talk to anyone.

87
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,340
You feel alone.

88
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,259
You feel alone.

89
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,259
So, I'm very lonely right now.

90
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,160
I have no one to talk to, no friends.

91
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,579
You know, no one makes me feel good.

92
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,199
Okay, so that means that you feel alone.

93
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,459
Alright, a lot of adjectives there.

94
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:32,959
There are many different ways to describe the way that you feel.

95
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
So, let's take a listen to the dialogue again.

96
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,160
Are you okay?

97
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,579
You seem a bit anxious.

98
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,120
Yeah, I'm okay.

99
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,300
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.

100
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:51,980
I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.

101
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,019
So, you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?

102
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,079
Yeah, it's weird.

103
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:03,540
For example, just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely, even though there was really no reason to feel that way.

104
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,779
Well, maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, brave, and hopeful.

105
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:09,959
I hope you're right.

106
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,439
Alright, we're back.

107
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,660
So, now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

108
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,720
Fluency Builder So, on Fluency Builder today, the first phrase is mood swings.

109
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,139
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,000
That's right.

111
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:35,279
So, this basically means that your mood is changing constantly all the time.

112
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,779
That's right.

113
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:40,360
So, your mood is the way that you feel and to swing means to go back and forth.

114
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,879
So, I'm happy, I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm, you know, lazy.

115
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:54,079
So, these are mood swings and it means that you're not normal, you're not flat, you're going up and down and feeling many different things.

116
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:54,519
Okay.

117
00:05:54,939 --> 00:06:02,339
So, to be clear, also, your mood is the way that you feel at a certain time or a certain day.

118
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:02,939
That's right.

119
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,060
So, you're in a good mood today.

120
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,600
Did you get good news?

121
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,259
That's right.

122
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:14,139
So, that means that you look like you are happy or it seems that your, I don't know, your personality is positive today.

123
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:14,540
That's right.

124
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:16,720
Or you could say, I'm in a bad mood.

125
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,759
Don't talk to me.

126
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:18,079
Uh-huh.

127
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:19,019
So, maybe you're angry.

128
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,399
Yeah.

129
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:20,160
All right.

130
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,639
Very good.

131
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:34,300
Now, to basically explain why we're having these mood swings, we say that, well, maybe it has to do with the pills the doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.

132
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,139
All right.

133
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,720
Chaos is a thing.

134
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,319
It's a noun.

135
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,279
And chaos means that there's no order.

136
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,839
Everything is crazy.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,920
It's out of control.

138
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:50,199
And so, basically, what this person is saying is that the pills that he's taking, it can feel out of control.

139
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:50,660
Right.

140
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:51,319
Exactly.

141
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,600
So, they are causing chaos, to cause chaos, to cause nothing in control on your hormones.

142
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,100
But what does hormones have to do with your mood?

143
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,040
All right.

144
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,699
Hormones are chemicals that your body actually produces.

145
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,579
Women have different hormones from men, but they affect the way that we feel.

146
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,660
So, oftentimes, you could say that I'm in a bad mood because of my hormones.

147
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:26,680
Pregnant women are very famous for having mood swings, happy, sad, angry, because they have more hormones in their bodies that they're not used to, and so they cannot control the way that they feel.

148
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,300
That's right.

149
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:39,759
So, an example is if a man has too much of one hormone, like testosterone is a hormone, then this person will usually be very aggressive, right?

150
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,759
That's right.

151
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,860
And the female counterpart to testosterone is estrogen.

152
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:47,480
So, if you have too much estrogen, maybe you'll be a little bit too sensitive.

153
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,360
Or emotional.

154
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:49,040
Or emotional.

155
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,519
That's right.

156
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,199
Okay.

157
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,019
So, that's what we talk about chaos and hormones.

158
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,699
Now, when we talked about mood swings, we take it as a noun, right?

159
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,139
You have mood swings.

160
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:04,319
But then at the end of the dialogue, we say, well, maybe your mood will swing positively.

161
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,740
So, now we're talking, it's separate.

162
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,660
It's not a noun.

163
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,040
We're taking swing as a verb.

164
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,199
To swing.

165
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,220
That means, think about a pendulum.

166
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,379
You know, a clock, it goes left and then swings right.

167
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,300
So, we could talk about a mood like this.

168
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,100
So, maybe your bad mood will swing the other way.

169
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,240
It will become a good mood.

170
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,839
And so, to swing here is the verb.

171
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,259
You can maybe try and encourage your mood to swing.

172
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:32,960
Okay.

173
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,679
So, to be clear, mood swings are a noun.

174
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:43,179
But then in this last part, we put the verb to swing to kind of explain where mood swings comes from, right?

175
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:48,899
So, the noun mood swings, now you understand that it's kind of like a pendulum and it's swinging back and forth and you're changing constantly.

176
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:49,519
Exactly.

177
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,360
All right.

178
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,600
So, let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.

179
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,559
Are you okay?

180
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,039
You seem a bit anxious.

181
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,519
Yeah, I'm okay.

182
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,720
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.

183
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:09,379
I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.

184
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,419
So, you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?

185
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,480
Yeah, it's weird.

186
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,139
For example, just this morning, I was feeling detached and lonely.

187
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,919
Even though there was really no reason to feel that way.

188
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:26,179
Well, maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, brave, and hopeful.

189
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,399
I hope you're right.

190
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,399
All right.

191
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:41,139
So, talking about moods, now there are certain, well, maybe like conditions where your mood is negatively affecting your life.

192
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:44,360
Like, for example, a person that suffers from anxiety.

193
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:45,399
That's right.

194
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,620
So, some people have anxiety disorders.

195
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,080
And this means that they're always worried about something.

196
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Right.

197
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,139
So, they're always anxious.

198
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,259
Always anxious.

199
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:01,620
So, people who are anxious often tap their fingers or their pencils or their foot, talk quickly.

200
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,620
So, anxiety, it's not fun to feel anxious.

201
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,139
And you can only imagine.

202
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:18,539
So, a lot of times these people who have anxiety problems, they will see their psychiatrist and they will try and get some medicine, some pills to help regulate their emotions, to help them feel in control.

203
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:19,200
Okay.

204
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:28,980
So, that I think is the most interesting thing for me is because your mood is actually very much dependent on what's going on chemically in your body.

205
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:40,299
So, as you say, you could actually balance out maybe if you're feeling too anxious with drugs, you can actually make you feel less anxious because of the chemicals.

206
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:40,919
Exactly.

207
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,480
And I think it's also important to remember that it's not just drugs that you take.

208
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:56,620
Sometimes people like to exercise and that helps them feel relaxed and calm because when you exercise, actually, your body produces certain chemicals that help you feel happy.

209
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,440
Or when you eat, sometimes when you haven't eaten, you notice that you're very, very cranky.

210
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,259
Oh, God, why are you doing this?

211
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,179
Why are you being like this?

212
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,500
And you eat and all of a sudden, oh, your body chemistry starts to change and so you feel better.

213
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:15,179
I heard that some people that suffer from anxiety disorders will be also compulsive eaters because they're nervous.

214
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,919
So, you know this, that some people eat when they're nervous.

215
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,639
This is one of the side effects, possibly, right?

216
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,039
It is.

217
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:26,159
I've heard this too, that a lot of people who are nervous or who are anxious, they overeat.

218
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,820
That means they eat too much.

219
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:28,840
Even when they're not hungry.

220
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,000
Even when they're not hungry.

221
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:40,480
And this actually has a very large effect on your body because, obviously, like I said, your body chemistry affects your mood.

222
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:47,100
So, if you eat too much, your body maybe reacts negatively and you're even less happy.

223
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,519
Right, right.

224
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:59,480
It happens to me sometimes in the movie theater, like a really good scene or I'm nervous or there's an action sequence and I'm just eating that popcorn up and I'm already really, really thirsty, but I just can't stop.

225
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,279
That's funny.

226
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:07,059
