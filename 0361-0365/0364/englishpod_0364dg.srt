EnglishPod.com Can you help me write a newspaper ad?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Sure.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What are you looking to buy or sell?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Actually, I want to hire someone to help me around the house.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, you want to get a maid?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, I think it's better if you call her a cleaning lady or domestic help.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay, so what do you want her to do?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, let's see.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I want her to come in three times a week for a couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom, and maybe do some cooking.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Got it.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And how much do you offer per month?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I would pay her hourly.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't know what the going rate is, though.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I know for sure it's more than minimum wage, but maybe you should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Great.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thanks for your help.
