00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,620
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,379
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,560
My name is Catherine, and today we're going to be helping you find someone to help out around the house.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,179
That's right.

5
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:14,919
So we're looking for someone to help us do some things around the house.

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,679
So we're going to talk about this more in depth.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,239
But first, let's take a look at one word on vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,940
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,579
So the beginning of today's dialogue has to do with a newspaper ad.

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,840
We are writing an ad for the newspaper.

11
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,200
Now, what exactly is a newspaper ad, Marco?

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,799
That's right.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:49,640
So in the newspapers, usually there is a section called the classifieds, where people post ads or advertisements or adverts where maybe they're selling their car or they're looking to hire people.

14
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:52,820
So this is what a newspaper ad is.

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,259
You're selling something, you're buying something, or maybe you want to hire people, et cetera.

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,960
It is basically an advertisement in the newspaper to find help.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:02,979
All right.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,159
So let's listen to our dialogue.

19
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,239
And when we come back, we'll be talking more about the words and phrases you've heard.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,980
Can you help me write a newspaper ad?

21
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:15,879
Sure.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,060
What are you looking to buy or sell?

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,280
Actually, I want to hire someone to help me around the house.

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,420
Oh, you want to get a maid?

25
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,439
Well, I think it's better if you call her a cleaning lady or domestic help.

26
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:30,799
Okay, so what do you want her to do?

27
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,060
Well, let's see.

28
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,420
I want her to come in three times a week for a couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom, and maybe do some cooking.

29
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,540
Got it.

30
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:40,939
And how much do you offer per month?

31
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,340
I would pay her hourly.

32
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,900
I don't know what the going rate is, though.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,939
I know for sure it's more than minimum wage, but maybe you should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.

34
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:50,680
Great.

35
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:51,620
Thanks for your help.

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,359
All right, we're back.

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,959
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.

38
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,659
Language takeaway.

39
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,759
Okay, so first of all, today, Marco, the advertisement is about wanting to hire someone.

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,599
Now, this is an important verb, especially when we're trying to find help.

41
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,199
The verb to hire.

42
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:14,900
That's right.

43
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,539
So to hire means to give someone work to offer a contract to someone.

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Okay, so my boss hired me three years ago.

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,259
That means he gave me a job three years ago.

46
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:28,719
That's right.

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,080
But this is not just for office jobs, this is for all kinds of jobs.

48
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:36,520
So what about cutting your grass or doing your lawn?

49
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:37,159
That's right.

50
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:42,120
So you can hire a gardener, for example, and it's basically the same thing.

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,840
It means that you're going to pay someone to work for you.

52
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,080
Okay, so today we wanted to hire a maid.

53
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,300
M-A-I-D, a maid.

54
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,020
But this is a little bit old-fashioned, this word.

55
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,740
What does a maid do or what did a maid do?

56
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:05,080
Well, a maid is basically a woman, a female servant, so to say, a person that basically serves you.

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,340
All right, so she cleans the house.

58
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:15,680
She maybe puts the covers on the beds, washes the dishes, cooks, does all of these domestic things.

59
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,020
So she works around the house.

60
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,060
But because there's a bad association, we don't like to think, oh, we have servants.

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,060
We don't say maid anymore.

62
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,560
We have two other ways of saying this word.

63
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,080
That's right.

64
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,800
So we could say that we want to hire a cleaning lady, right, or we want to hire domestic help.

65
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,879
Okay, now there's an important difference between these two words.

66
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:43,240
First of all, cleaning lady is a woman, a lady, and she is someone who only cleans.

67
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,560
She doesn't take care of your children.

68
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,539
She doesn't walk your dog.

69
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:52,840
She basically just cleans the house, washes the dishes, cleans the clothes, washes the floors.

70
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,379
So she's a cleaning lady.

71
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,319
Now domestic help, this is a little bit more general.

72
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:09,620
Right, so domestic help would be a little bit more in-depth of what the person's going to do, so will help with the domestic work, domestic meaning the house.

73
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:20,079
So this person will maybe cook for you, clean the house, take care of the kids, do everything that is associated with the house.

74
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,279
So it's important to see that domestic means something that has to do with the house.

75
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:28,360
This is help man or woman in the house.

76
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:28,800
Right.

77
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,600
All right, so that's all we have for language takeaway, but we do have another section Fluency Builder, in which we're going to look at some great words and phrases.

78
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:51,240
Fluency Builder All right, so first on Fluency Builder, let's take a look at how we're going to pay the person, because obviously we were saying that we want to hire this person, we're going to pay them.

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,100
So how are we going to pay them?

80
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:57,420
The person said, I would pay the woman her hourly.

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,620
I would pay her hourly.

82
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,560
Okay, so this is the rate.

83
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,360
This is how much she will be paid.

84
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:09,240
And we don't say she will be paid $10,000 per year, we say she will be paid $10 per hour.

85
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,680
So we pay per hour, this is paying her hourly.

86
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,379
Right, so if you have an hourly wage, that means that you get paid per hour.

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,079
In contrast with a salary, that means that you would get a fixed amount every month.

88
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:36,639
All right, so if the monthly salary is $1,000, for example, you could break that down and say, but every day you earn $100, you work 10 days.

89
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,660
But if it's hourly, you say you'll get paid $10 per hour.

90
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,560
So if you work four hours today, you will earn $40.

91
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,420
That's right.

92
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,839
Okay, so now we want to pay the cleaning lady hourly, but we don't know what the going rate is.

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,500
Going rate, going.

94
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,740
So this is an interesting phrase, and it's important to notice that going rate is an amount of money, but it's not always the same.

95
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,699
It depends on the industry.

96
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:18,519
So the going rate for a teacher is different from the going rate for a cleaning lady, which is different from the going rate for a language tutor, or like an English tutor.

97
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:25,439
So first of all, the going rate is how much these people, these cleaning ladies, normally earn.

98
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,240
It's an average.

99
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:34,199
Right, so you would usually calculate it, say the approximate going rate is between maybe $8 to $10 per hour.

100
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,379
So it's not like an exact amount.

101
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,759
You would say the going rate is more or less a certain amount.

102
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,779
It's not exact.

103
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,139
So you might ask your friends, what do you pay your cleaning lady?

104
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,420
And one friend says, oh, I pay $12 per hour.

105
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,980
And my other friend says, oh, I pay about $8 per hour.

106
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,100
So to me, it sounds like the going rate is about $10 per hour.

107
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,079
Right, exactly.

108
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,540
So we're not really sure what the going rate is.

109
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,740
So our friend says, well, you know what, I'm sure it's more than minimum wage.

110
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:12,279
Now minimum wage is actually something that the government decides on, or either the federal government in America or the state.

111
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:19,879
And each state will have a number that they say that is the least you can pay a person per hour.

112
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,860
Right, right.

113
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,319
So it is the law.

114
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,040
If you pay less, it's illegal.

115
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,860
And this is because we expect everyone to be treated fairly, right?

116
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,639
So you don't want to take advantage of people.

117
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,100
No.

118
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:38,300
And so, for example, in America, in my state, Illinois, I think the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.

119
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,720
Oh, really?

120
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,040
Wow.

121
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,959
It's pretty high.

122
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,600
And this is because people need to pay for health care and cars and houses and children.

123
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,139
So we say the least you can pay someone is $7.25.

124
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,939
Now this is different, as you said, it could be different from state to state, right?

125
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,079
Because I know in some states, if I'm not mistaken, it's like $5.50 or something like Yeah, some states it's $5.

126
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,500
It depends on the cost of living.

127
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:12,100
If it's cheap to rent an apartment or to find transportation, then obviously the minimum wage is going to be lower.

128
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,600
Obviously there's no maximum wage.

129
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,920
There's no number that is the most you can pay someone, but all states have a minimum wage.

130
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:23,360
It's the least that you can pay someone per hour.

131
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:37,000
And now for our last phrase, we don't know what the minimum wage is, we're not really sure what the going rate is, so we should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,860
Now to negotiate is a great verb.

133
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,259
It is something that all of us do all the time.

134
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,220
To negotiate means to try and compromise or to reach an agreement.

135
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,759
And so maybe I say, the most I will pay is $11.

136
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,419
So I say, okay, I'll pay you $9.

137
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,240
And I say, no, I'll take $12.

138
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,039
Yeah, sorry, $12 is too much.

139
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,419
I'll pay you $10.

140
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,120
Okay, $11.

141
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:06,879
$11?

142
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:07,960
Okay, agreed.

143
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:08,659
Okay.

144
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:19,000
So it's a way of reaching an agreement, like you say, where both sides have their goals and they try to find a price that is the best for both parties.

145
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,500
That's right.

146
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:27,419
So it's basically a verb to negotiate, and this is what you do, as you said, in many circumstances, especially when you're getting a job.

147
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:27,919
Yes.

148
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:32,539
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue one last time, and we'll be back in a bit.

149
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,279
Can you help me write a newspaper ad?

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,179
Sure.

151
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,340
What are you looking to buy or sell?

152
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,559
Actually, I want to hire someone to help me around the house.

153
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,720
Oh, you want to get a maid?

154
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,740
Well, I think it's better if you call her a cleaning lady or domestic help.

155
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:56,100
Okay, so what do you want her to do?

156
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,360
Well, let's see.

157
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,740
I want her to come in three times a week for a couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom, and maybe do some cooking.

158
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,799
Got it.

159
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,240
And how much do you offer per month?

160
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,639
I would pay her hourly.

161
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,220
I don't know what the going rate is, though.

162
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:15,240
I know for sure it's more than minimum wage, but maybe you should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.

163
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:15,980
Great.

164
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:16,840
Thanks for your help.

165
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:27,460
All right, so talking about minimum wage, is there any exception to why a person would earn less than minimum wage?

166
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,080
I don't believe so.

167
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,120
Well, if they're not legally employed, right?

168
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:43,000
So if you're talking about people who we say are under the table, working under the table, that means that they're not working legally, they're not paying taxes, then maybe those people will be paid less.

169
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:45,059
What about waiters and waitresses?

170
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,220
I've heard that they earn less than minimum wage, but because they earn tips.

171
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,220
This is true.

172
00:10:50,440 --> 00:11:02,139
So most restaurants say, okay, we will pay you as a waiter $3 an hour, but because you will earn tips, you will earn more than the minimum wage.

173
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,980
So this is a good exception.

174
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,360
Unfortunately, there's no promise.

175
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:10,220
If you have no customers, you earn no tips, so you're still earning less than minimum wage.

176
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,659
That's right.

177
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:19,059
But it's possible that you also have many, many customers, and you earn lots of tips, and you make $15 an hour or something much higher than the minimum wage.

178
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:19,600
That's right.

179
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:29,460
And actually, being a waiter or a waitress is a very common job that a lot of people have when they're still in school or over the summer.

180
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,919
And I've heard that it could be quite good, because Americans are pretty good tippers.

181
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,679
That's right.

182
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:44,980
Americans generally tip between 15% and 20%, and you know that you have to tip because your waiter does not earn a minimum wage.

183
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,899
And so I think there is this expectation.

184
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:55,840
So if your bill comes out to like $100, then you are most definitely going to leave at least a $20 tip.

185
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,159
Usually, yeah, $15 to $20.

186
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,019
$20 if it's that much money.

187
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:00,700
Wow.

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,179
Wow.

189
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:12,600
That's very, very interesting, especially considering that in many countries, tipping is not really considered, it's not expected, or it's not really something that people do.

190
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:13,440
Exactly.

191
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,159
And in America, it is something that you have to do.

192
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,519
So I think a lot of times when people come to America, they don't expect to pay this.

193
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,980
There's tax, there's tip.

194
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,620
So when you see a menu, remember that the cost is a lot higher than what you see.

195
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,779
All right, very, very interesting topic.
