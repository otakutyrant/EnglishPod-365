00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're going to be helping you find someone to help out around the house.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So we're looking for someone to help us do some things around the house.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So we're going to talk about this more in depth.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But first, let's take a look at one word on vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So the beginning of today's dialogue has to do with a newspaper ad.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We are writing an ad for the newspaper.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, what exactly is a newspaper ad, Marco?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's right.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So in the newspapers, usually there is a section called the classifieds, where people post ads or advertisements or adverts where maybe they're selling their car or they're looking to hire people.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So this is what a newspaper ad is.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're selling something, you're buying something, or maybe you want to hire people, et cetera.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It is basically an advertisement in the newspaper to find help.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
All right.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So let's listen to our dialogue.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And when we come back, we'll be talking more about the words and phrases you've heard.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Can you help me write a newspaper ad?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sure.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What are you looking to buy or sell?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Actually, I want to hire someone to help me around the house.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, you want to get a maid?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, I think it's better if you call her a cleaning lady or domestic help.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay, so what do you want her to do?

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, let's see.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want her to come in three times a week for a couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom, and maybe do some cooking.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Got it.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And how much do you offer per month?

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I would pay her hourly.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't know what the going rate is, though.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I know for sure it's more than minimum wage, but maybe you should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Great.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thanks for your help.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
All right, we're back.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Language takeaway.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, so first of all, today, Marco, the advertisement is about wanting to hire someone.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Now, this is an important verb, especially when we're trying to find help.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The verb to hire.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's right.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So to hire means to give someone work to offer a contract to someone.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay, so my boss hired me three years ago.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That means he gave me a job three years ago.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But this is not just for office jobs, this is for all kinds of jobs.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So what about cutting your grass or doing your lawn?

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's right.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So you can hire a gardener, for example, and it's basically the same thing.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It means that you're going to pay someone to work for you.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay, so today we wanted to hire a maid.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
M-A-I-D, a maid.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But this is a little bit old-fashioned, this word.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What does a maid do or what did a maid do?

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, a maid is basically a woman, a female servant, so to say, a person that basically serves you.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
All right, so she cleans the house.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
She maybe puts the covers on the beds, washes the dishes, cooks, does all of these domestic things.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So she works around the house.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But because there's a bad association, we don't like to think, oh, we have servants.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We don't say maid anymore.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We have two other ways of saying this word.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So we could say that we want to hire a cleaning lady, right, or we want to hire domestic help.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, now there's an important difference between these two words.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
First of all, cleaning lady is a woman, a lady, and she is someone who only cleans.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She doesn't take care of your children.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
She doesn't walk your dog.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She basically just cleans the house, washes the dishes, cleans the clothes, washes the floors.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So she's a cleaning lady.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Now domestic help, this is a little bit more general.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Right, so domestic help would be a little bit more in-depth of what the person's going to do, so will help with the domestic work, domestic meaning the house.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So this person will maybe cook for you, clean the house, take care of the kids, do everything that is associated with the house.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So it's important to see that domestic means something that has to do with the house.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is help man or woman in the house.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Right.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All right, so that's all we have for language takeaway, but we do have another section Fluency Builder, in which we're going to look at some great words and phrases.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Fluency Builder All right, so first on Fluency Builder, let's take a look at how we're going to pay the person, because obviously we were saying that we want to hire this person, we're going to pay them.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So how are we going to pay them?

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The person said, I would pay the woman her hourly.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I would pay her hourly.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, so this is the rate.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is how much she will be paid.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And we don't say she will be paid $10,000 per year, we say she will be paid $10 per hour.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So we pay per hour, this is paying her hourly.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Right, so if you have an hourly wage, that means that you get paid per hour.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
In contrast with a salary, that means that you would get a fixed amount every month.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:36,000
All right, so if the monthly salary is $1,000, for example, you could break that down and say, but every day you earn $100, you work 10 days.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But if it's hourly, you say you'll get paid $10 per hour.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So if you work four hours today, you will earn $40.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's right.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, so now we want to pay the cleaning lady hourly, but we don't know what the going rate is.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Going rate, going.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So this is an interesting phrase, and it's important to notice that going rate is an amount of money, but it's not always the same.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It depends on the industry.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So the going rate for a teacher is different from the going rate for a cleaning lady, which is different from the going rate for a language tutor, or like an English tutor.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So first of all, the going rate is how much these people, these cleaning ladies, normally earn.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's an average.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Right, so you would usually calculate it, say the approximate going rate is between maybe $8 to $10 per hour.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So it's not like an exact amount.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You would say the going rate is more or less a certain amount.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's not exact.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So you might ask your friends, what do you pay your cleaning lady?

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And one friend says, oh, I pay $12 per hour.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And my other friend says, oh, I pay about $8 per hour.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So to me, it sounds like the going rate is about $10 per hour.

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Right, exactly.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So we're not really sure what the going rate is.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So our friend says, well, you know what, I'm sure it's more than minimum wage.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Now minimum wage is actually something that the government decides on, or either the federal government in America or the state.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And each state will have a number that they say that is the least you can pay a person per hour.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Right, right.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So it is the law.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If you pay less, it's illegal.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And this is because we expect everyone to be treated fairly, right?

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So you don't want to take advantage of people.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And so, for example, in America, in my state, Illinois, I think the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh, really?

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Wow.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's pretty high.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And this is because people need to pay for health care and cars and houses and children.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So we say the least you can pay someone is $7.25.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Now this is different, as you said, it could be different from state to state, right?

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Because I know in some states, if I'm not mistaken, it's like $5.50 or something like Yeah, some states it's $5.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It depends on the cost of living.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If it's cheap to rent an apartment or to find transportation, then obviously the minimum wage is going to be lower.

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Obviously there's no maximum wage.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There's no number that is the most you can pay someone, but all states have a minimum wage.

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's the least that you can pay someone per hour.

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And now for our last phrase, we don't know what the minimum wage is, we're not really sure what the going rate is, so we should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Now to negotiate is a great verb.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It is something that all of us do all the time.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
To negotiate means to try and compromise or to reach an agreement.

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And so maybe I say, the most I will pay is $11.

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So I say, okay, I'll pay you $9.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And I say, no, I'll take $12.

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah, sorry, $12 is too much.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'll pay you $10.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay, $11.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
$11?

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay, agreed.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So it's a way of reaching an agreement, like you say, where both sides have their goals and they try to find a price that is the best for both parties.

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's right.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So it's basically a verb to negotiate, and this is what you do, as you said, in many circumstances, especially when you're getting a job.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes.

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue one last time, and we'll be back in a bit.

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Can you help me write a newspaper ad?

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Sure.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What are you looking to buy or sell?

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Actually, I want to hire someone to help me around the house.

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, you want to get a maid?

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, I think it's better if you call her a cleaning lady or domestic help.

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay, so what do you want her to do?

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, let's see.

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I want her to come in three times a week for a couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom, and maybe do some cooking.

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Got it.

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And how much do you offer per month?

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I would pay her hourly.

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't know what the going rate is, though.

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I know for sure it's more than minimum wage, but maybe you should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Great.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Thanks for your help.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
All right, so talking about minimum wage, is there any exception to why a person would earn less than minimum wage?

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't believe so.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, if they're not legally employed, right?

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So if you're talking about people who we say are under the table, working under the table, that means that they're not working legally, they're not paying taxes, then maybe those people will be paid less.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What about waiters and waitresses?

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I've heard that they earn less than minimum wage, but because they earn tips.

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This is true.

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So most restaurants say, okay, we will pay you as a waiter $3 an hour, but because you will earn tips, you will earn more than the minimum wage.

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So this is a good exception.

174
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Unfortunately, there's no promise.

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If you have no customers, you earn no tips, so you're still earning less than minimum wage.

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's right.

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But it's possible that you also have many, many customers, and you earn lots of tips, and you make $15 an hour or something much higher than the minimum wage.

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's right.

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And actually, being a waiter or a waitress is a very common job that a lot of people have when they're still in school or over the summer.

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And I've heard that it could be quite good, because Americans are pretty good tippers.

181
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's right.

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Americans generally tip between 15% and 20%, and you know that you have to tip because your waiter does not earn a minimum wage.

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And so I think there is this expectation.

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So if your bill comes out to like $100, then you are most definitely going to leave at least a $20 tip.

185
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Usually, yeah, $15 to $20.

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
$20 if it's that much money.

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Wow.

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Wow.

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's very, very interesting, especially considering that in many countries, tipping is not really considered, it's not expected, or it's not really something that people do.

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Exactly.

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And in America, it is something that you have to do.

192
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So I think a lot of times when people come to America, they don't expect to pay this.

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There's tax, there's tip.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So when you see a menu, remember that the cost is a lot higher than what you see.

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
All right, very, very interesting topic.
