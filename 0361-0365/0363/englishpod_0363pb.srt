00:00:01,039 --> 00:00:03,379
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:04,099
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:08,580
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about a special kind of man.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,279
That's right.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:18,420
Today we are, well, everyone starts living with your parents, but as adults, some people still want to continue living with their parents.

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:19,260
That's right.

7
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:23,940
So the topic of today's lesson is living with your parents when you're an adult.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,559
Let's take a listen to the dialogue.

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,420
Why did your girlfriend break up with you?

10
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:34,539
I don't know.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,979
She said she was tired of me not manning up and being more independent, which I think is all a bunch of crap.

12
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,820
Well, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point.

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,759
What do you mean?

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,719
A lot of people live with their parents, especially when rent is so expensive and the slump in the economy.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,079
Yeah, but you're almost 40.

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,060
Plus, you make good money, so there's really no excuse.

17
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,560
It's just simply because you're a mama's boy.

18
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,659
Whatever, dude.

19
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,000
I have everything I need.

20
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,140
Why would I move out?

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,920
Have a great roof over my head.

22
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,819
My mom does my laundry and cooks for me.

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,159
What else could a guy ask for?

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,799
Let's agree to disagree.

25
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,799
All right, we're back.

26
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,819
So now let's take a look at some language on language takeaway.

27
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:18,659
Language takeaway.

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,000
The first verb we have here is to break up.

29
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,439
So we heard the guy say, why did your girlfriend break up with you?

30
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:27,040
That's right.

31
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:35,159
So this is a phrasal verb and to break up in a relationship or in a romantic sense means to end a relationship.

32
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,219
So if you break up with your girlfriend, it means you end the relationship.

33
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,099
That's right.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,799
So you think about breaking something.

35
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,920
It goes into pieces.

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,000
Well, in a relationship, it means you both leave each other.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,459
You go your separate ways.

38
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:52,879
And so you can say, he broke up with me or we broke up.

39
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:53,540
That's right.

40
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:01,519
And the reason his girlfriend broke up with him is because she said he was not independent.

41
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,680
So she wanted him to be more independent.

42
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,860
So independent means that you do things on your own.

43
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,740
You do things alone.

44
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,460
You don't expect other people to help you.

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,659
You don't depend on other people.

46
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:16,139
Exactly.

47
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,659
So you can say, he's very independent.

48
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,580
He loves to travel alone.

49
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:21,139
Okay.

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,560
So it means that you don't really need other people's help, I guess, right?

51
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,060
Exactly.

52
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:25,680
Okay.

53
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,379
All right.

54
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,120
So he's not really very independent and well, his friend agrees.

55
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,240
He says, well, you know what?

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,099
I think she has a point.

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,300
To have a point means to say something that the other person agrees with.

58
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:40,879
Okay.

59
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,639
So you could say, he has a point.

60
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,060
I agree with him.

61
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,680
That's a good argument.

62
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:54,599
So if somebody says something and you agree with that when you say, yeah, you have a point, it means you agree with the argument.

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,340
You agree with what that person says.

64
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,199
All right.

65
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,879
And now lastly, because he lives with his parents, his friend is saying that he should move out.

66
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:04,979
You should move out.

67
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,800
So here's another phrasal verb, to move out.

68
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,560
This means that you leave the house and you find a new house.

69
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:15,439
So when you're with your parents, you want to move out.

70
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,580
That means you don't live with your parents anymore, but you find your own house.

71
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,379
That's right.

72
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:27,900
So, well, in general, when you find your own house, when you leave and your current place of living, that's moving out, right?

73
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,580
That's right.

74
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,879
So if I'm leaving the city, I move out of my house.

75
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,680
And then when I arrive in a new city, I move in to a new house.

76
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,460
Very good.

77
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,300
So to move out and to move in, they go hand in hand.

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:41,960
All right.

79
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,060
So let's listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

80
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:53,000
Why did your girlfriend break up with you?

81
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,159
I don't know.

82
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,580
She said she was tired of me not manning up and being more independent, which I think is all a bunch of crap.

83
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,419
Well, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point.

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,360
What do you mean?

85
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,319
A lot of people live with their parents, especially when rent is so expensive and the slump in the economy.

86
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,659
Yeah, but you're almost 40.

87
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,639
Plus, you make good money, so there's really no excuse.

88
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,160
It's just simply because you're a mama's boy.

89
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,259
Whatever, dude.

90
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,600
I have everything I need.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,759
Why would I move out?

92
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,519
Have a great roof over my head.

93
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,420
My mom does my laundry and cooks for me.

94
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,779
What else could a guy ask for?

95
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,420
Let's agree to disagree.

96
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,620
All right.

97
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,420
So now four phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

98
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,420
Fluency Builder.

99
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,720
So we've got a very interesting phrase here at the beginning of Fluency Builder today.

100
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,279
The phrase is manning up.

101
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,959
So the girlfriend was tired of the man not manning up.

102
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,120
So to man up.

103
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,839
And what does that mean, to man up to something?

104
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,360
It means to be responsible or to be more mature or to be an adult about something.

105
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:05,060
So maybe this guy, this man, he's kind of immature.

106
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,019
That's right.

107
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:10,180
He lives at home, he's not very responsible or independent.

108
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,759
And his girlfriend wanted him to be more responsible, more independent.

109
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:16,839
So she wanted him to man up.

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,519
That's right.

111
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:22,899
So it usually means that you also should accept the consequences for your actions, right?

112
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,779
Exactly.

113
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:32,560
So you might push someone to man up, take responsibility for something, and do it even though the consequences might not be fun or good.

114
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,480
Now this, remember, is very, very much slang.

115
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,899
So you don't say this in an essay or a paper.

116
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,199
Right.

117
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:39,720
This is what you say between friends.

118
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:47,519
And another slang phrase here that we use to describe this man is a mama's boy.

119
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,000
His friend says he's a mama's boy.

120
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,100
Mama's boy.

121
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,540
So mama is mother.

122
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,939
Mama's boy means that he's very, very close with his mother.

123
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,220
This is not a good thing to say.

124
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,560
It's usually something that's a little bit critical.

125
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,160
Okay.

126
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,540
So you say he's a mama's boy.

127
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:04,160
Okay.

128
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,079
His mother washes his clothes.

129
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,480
She cooks his food.

130
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,279
She does everything for him.

131
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:09,839
Right.

132
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,800
And he doesn't do anything for himself.

133
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,860
He's like a little baby.

134
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,959
He's like a child.

135
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,620
And his mama, his mother, does everything for him.

136
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,660
So it is a little bit like an insult, I guess.

137
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,060
Yes.

138
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:19,560
Okay.

139
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:26,680
So it's not really a good thing to call someone a mama's boy, unless in this situation their friends and his friend is saying, well, you know what?

140
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,920
It seems like you're a mama's boy.

141
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,439
Exactly.

142
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,540
All right.

143
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,980
Now, our next phrase is when he was justifying and saying, why would I move out?

144
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,620
Why would I leave my parents' house?

145
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,160
I have a great roof over my head.

146
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,600
So what does he mean by a great roof?

147
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,180
Okay.

148
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:44,740
So the roof means the top of your house.

149
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,600
You know, obviously our houses, they're not open.

150
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,639
They have a cover, and that's called a roof.

151
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,319
But the phrase here, a roof over my head, or a roof over one's head, means a place to live.

152
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,839
Okay.

153
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:56,560
A home.

154
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,459
So if you say, I don't have a roof over my head.

155
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,040
That means I don't have a home.

156
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,879
I don't have a house.

157
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:03,680
Okay.

158
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,339
So he's saying that he has a great roof over his head.

159
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,980
His mom does everything for him.

160
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,779
So he's like, why would I move out?

161
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,279
And his friend ends the conversation by saying, you know what?

162
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,040
Let's agree to disagree.

163
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,120
This is a really important phrase to learn, especially if you like to argue a lot.

164
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,819
In this case, one guy said, listen, living at home is good.

165
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:25,000
It works for me.

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,160
And the other said, no, it's not very responsible.

167
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:29,439
I agree with your girlfriend.

168
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,300
And at the end, they still believe what they thought originally, so they agree to disagree.

169
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:40,000
That means they're not going to argue anymore, but they're not going to change their minds.

170
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,699
So I respect your opinion, and you respect my opinion, and the conversation is over.

171
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,279
So Marco, chocolate ice cream is clearly the best ice cream.

172
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,100
Vanilla ice cream is the best ice cream.

173
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,980
Yeah, no, I think chocolate has more flavor.

174
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,360
No, vanilla is tastier.

175
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,779
Okay, let's agree to disagree.

176
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,199
That's right.

177
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,920
I still think chocolate is the best.

178
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,379
Marco still thinks vanilla is the best, but we're not going to argue anymore.

179
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay, great.

180
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,740
So let's listen to her dialogue one last time.

181
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:15,519
Why did your girlfriend break up with you?

182
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,660
I don't know.

183
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,079
She said she was tired of me not manning up and being more independent, which I think is all a bunch of crap.

184
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,920
Well, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point.

185
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:26,839
What do you mean?

186
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:31,800
A lot of people live with their parents, especially when rent is so expensive and the slump in the economy.

187
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,159
Yeah, but you're almost 40.

188
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,139
Plus, you make good money, so there's really no excuse.

189
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,659
It's just simply because you're a mama's boy.

190
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,759
Whatever, dude.

191
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:42,080
I have everything I need.

192
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,240
Why would I move out?

193
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,919
I have a great roof over my head, my mom does my laundry and cooks for me.

194
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:48,259
What else could a guy ask for?

195
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,879
Let's agree to disagree.

196
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:57,440
Alright, so talking about a mama's boy living at home.

197
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:06,720
Now, as he mentioned, in the United States, kids usually leave home when they're 18 or 19 when they go to college, right?

198
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:20,019
But in other places, like in Latin America, or even, for example, in many parts of Europe, people will live at home until they're 24 or 26 because it is expensive to live by yourself.

199
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:27,580
It is, and so in a lot of these countries, you hear people maybe joking about the men being mama's boys.

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,059
Like Italy, for example, this is often something that people like to joke about.

201
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:46,080
Obviously, it's not true in most cases, but it is true that a lot of people live with their families until later because, like you say, it's expensive, or maybe in their culture, in their tradition, you don't leave your home until you get married.

202
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,340
Right, because it could be also for religious reasons.

203
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:59,019
Exactly, and so I think it differs from culture to culture, but this idea of a mama's boy is very, very much a part of American culture.

204
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,460
We often talk about this.

205
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,980
We often joke about it, and sometimes you say, oh, you're such a mama's boy because sometimes, like my brother, sometimes he calls my mom a lot.

206
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,379
So I say, oh, you're such a mama's boy, always calling mom.

207
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,100
Now, obviously, this works for guys, but what about girls?

208
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,940
Would you say like daddy's girl?

209
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,240
Yeah, a little bit.

210
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,940
It's usually girls who get everything they want from their dads.

211
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,980
Like, daddy, I want a new car.

212
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,980
Daddy, I want new clothes.

213
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:35,879
Yeah, so daddy's girl is someone who is very close with their dad and maybe is able to have him give her lots of stuff that she wants.

214
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:42,120
So we don't really hear like daddy's boy or mama's girl very often, right?

215
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,039
It's always the opposite.

216
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,220
Yeah, exactly.

217
00:10:44,879 --> 00:11:01,240
Well, it's a very interesting topic, and I'm sure many of you in your different cultures may also continue living with your parents, or maybe it's not common, or maybe even after marriage in many parts of Asia, people get married and live at home with their in-laws.

218
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:01,899
That's right.

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,279
So we're very curious to hear about your experience in your country.

220
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,220
Do you have such a thing as a mama's boy or a daddy's girl?

221
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,700
Let us know.
