EnglishPod.com Why did your girlfriend break up with you?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't know.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
She said she was tired of me not manning up and being more independent, which I think is all a bunch of crap.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What do you mean?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A lot of people live with their parents, especially when rent is so expensive and the slump in the economy.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, but you're almost 40.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Plus, you make good money, so there's really no excuse.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's just simply because you're a mama's boy.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Whatever, dude.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have everything I need.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why would I move out?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I have a great roof over my head, my mom does my laundry and cooks for me.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What else could a guy ask for?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's agree to disagree.
