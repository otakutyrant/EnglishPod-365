EnglishPod.com Why did your girlfriend break up with you?

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,759
I don't know.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,179
She said she was tired of me not manning up and being more independent, which I think is all a bunch of crap.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,039
Well, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,960
What do you mean?

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,899
A lot of people live with their parents, especially when rent is so expensive and the slump in the economy.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,280
Yeah, but you're almost 40.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,260
Plus, you make good money, so there's really no excuse.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,759
It's just simply because you're a mama's boy.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,859
Whatever, dude.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,200
I have everything I need.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,340
Why would I move out?

13
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:40,020
I have a great roof over my head, my mom does my laundry and cooks for me.

14
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,359
What else could a guy ask for?

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's agree to disagree.
