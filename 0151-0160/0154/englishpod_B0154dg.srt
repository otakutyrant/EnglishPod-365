00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com I'm forming a music band.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Do you already know how to play an instrument?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Uh, yeah.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We have a guy who plays guitar and another who plays bass.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Although, we still haven't found anyone to be our singer.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You told me that you had some musical talent, right?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm a singer.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Perfect!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So you can audition this weekend here at my house.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Great!

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wait here?

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones, or even your drums.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
By the way, where do you keep them or practice?

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Dude, what are you talking about?

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's right here.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
All we need is my Nintendo Wii and we're set.
