00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:07,839
EnglishPod.com I'm forming a music band.

2
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,359
Do you already know how to play an instrument?

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,519
Uh, yeah.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,880
I told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,280
Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,019
Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band?

7
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,920
We have a guy who plays guitar and another who plays bass.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,039
Although, we still haven't found anyone to be our singer.

9
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,620
You told me that you had some musical talent, right?

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:31,359
Yes.

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,200
I'm a singer.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:32,799
Perfect!

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,259
So you can audition this weekend here at my house.

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,259
Great!

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:37,640
Wait here?

16
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:42,020
You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones, or even your drums.

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,020
By the way, where do you keep them or practice?

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,500
Dude, what are you talking about?

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:48,420
It's right here.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,159
All we need is my Nintendo Wii and we're set.
