00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And today we're talking about a topic very close to my heart, music.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to be talking about music, and more specifically, we are going to talk about musical instruments that you would use in a band.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All right.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And so some people like to make their own music, get together, hang out, play music together.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So that's what we're talking about today.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We've got a new band that's going to start.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And before we get going, we've got a word to talk about.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And let's check this out in today's vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
All right.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So as I mentioned, we are going to talk about instruments.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Instruments.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So you could say musical instruments, but what is an instrument, generally speaking?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Basically, it's similar to a tool, right?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So an instrument is something that you use to help you realize a task.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In this case, musical instruments is more specific, right?

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Right.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So we're talking about things that you use to make music.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
A piano, for example.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is a musical instrument.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Or the drums.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All right.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So this is what we're going to be looking at today in the dialogues.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So let's listen to it for the first time.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm forming a music band.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you already know how to play an instrument?

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Uh, yeah.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band?

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We have a guy who plays guitar and another who plays bass.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You told me that you had some musical talent, right?

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm a singer.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So you can audition this weekend here at my house.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Great!

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Wait here?

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones, or even your drums.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
By the way, where do you keep them or practice?

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Dude, what are you talking about?

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's right here.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
All we need is my Nintendo Wii and we're set.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right, we're back.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So apparently the band wasn't really a real band.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It wasn't, but I have to say I'm very familiar with this because I have a Nintendo Wii and I often play the game rock bands, so I can sympathize with the characters here.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So you also have your own band.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I do, well, virtually speaking.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And I know you do too.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I do too.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's right.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We are both fans of this game and this gaming console and that's why it's such a fun dialogue.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But let's take a look at some of the language that was used in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Language Takeaway.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh man, so I've been in a lot of bands and I've been in a lot of musical groups, so I can say that the first instrument we want to talk about is maybe the most obnoxious.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The most loud and hard to listen to.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Probably, probably.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And that instrument is the drums.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Right, so the drums, it's plural because you have many drums, right?

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Right, you don't just have the dum, dum, dum, dum, the bass drum, you have many different drums together and so we could also call this a drum set.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A drum set.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Alright, so why don't we listen to an example of what a drum set sounds like.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Alright, we're back, so I think that's clear.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Moving on to our next instrument.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This one's maybe the most popular for young people to start because you can play pretty much anything with it and it's also good for sing-alongs.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Right, and that instrument is the guitar.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Can you play the guitar?

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No, I can't.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I actually wish I would have learned but I never got around to it.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, this is a really beautiful instrument and there are many different ways to play it but generally it's either wooden with some strings or electric so it's plastic with some metal strings.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Right, exactly.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So they have a different sound but why don't we listen to an example of what a guitar sounds like.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Alright so, great example of a guitar, pretty clear.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's our next instrument?

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The bass and this one, it doesn't look like the word that's written, B-A-S-S, so we say bass.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Bass.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And it's actually a very low instrument, it's usually used to help keep the rhythm.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So it's similar to a guitar, right?

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's the same form but as you say, it's lower and it makes a lower sound.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Exactly.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Alright, so let's listen to an example of a bass now.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Alright, pretty clear.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Moving on to our next word, we have an amplifier.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, so an amplifier is a thing, it's usually a box that we plug in that's electric or it's electronic, and it's a tool to make electrical instruments like the electric guitar or the electric bass, louder.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Right, exactly, so an amplifier is any device that makes a sound become louder.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Exactly.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Alright.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So this is really important for rock bands the world over.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Very good.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Our next instrument, or actually more of a tool, is very useful for the singer.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, and it actually goes with the amplifier in many ways because the microphone, this is our next word, the microphone is something that you use to sing into to make your voice louder.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So right now, Marco, you and I are both using microphones.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Exactly, so a microphone.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Very good, and we have one last word and this is a verb, to audition.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Alright, to audition.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So to audition means to show someone your talent, alright?

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So oftentimes when you start a play or an opera or a musical group, you want to have auditions, you want to audition people to see how much talent they have.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Alright, so it's basically an opportunity to demonstrate your skills and abilities.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So a job interview wouldn't really be an audition.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, a job interview has its own word, but here we're talking about your singing ability, your acting ability, your reading ability, and sometimes we even have auditions here at EnglishPod to see how people, how comfortable people are on the microphone.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's a way to have people show what they've got.

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Very good, alright.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So a lot of interesting words here, many instruments.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit and we'll be right back.

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm forming a music band.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Do you already know how to play an instrument?

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Uh, yeah.

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band?

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We have a guy who plays guitar and another who plays bass, although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You told me that you had some musical talent, right?

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes, I'm a singer.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Perfect!

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So you can audition this weekend here at my house.

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Great!

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Wait here?

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones, or even your drums.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
By the way, where do you keep them or practice?

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Dude, what are you talking about?

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's right here.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
All we need is my Nintendo Wii and we're set.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Alright, we're back.

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So moving on with our lesson, why don't we take a look now at some phrases in Fluency Builder.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Alright, so on Fluency Builder we have four phrases.

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What's the first one?

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, this first phrase is really important, Marco, because we're talking about bands and starting bands, and so there's often a phrase we use to describe this.

133
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We say, to form a band.

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Alright, so you form a band.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's like forming something.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
To form is to shape it, to make it look like something that you want, and so we can form artistic projects also, but you don't have to do that.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But here we're forming a band, we're choosing people to bring together to make great music.

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Alright, so we can say form a band or you can say as well, start a band.

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So, we're forming a band and, well, his friend was surprised that the other guy knew how to play an instrument, so he said, I've told you a thousand times.

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Wait, wait, so he told him one thousand times.

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No, not literally.

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I play an instrument, I play an instrument, I play an instrument.

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Right, this is a phrase, and it's a little bit of an exaggeration to emphasize that I've told you many, many times already.

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Great, so this is something we say when we're trying to exaggerate, like Marco said, or to really emphasize the point that, like, I've told you this before.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So mothers often use, I feel like we talk about mothers a lot here, mothers often use this phrase when kids do something wrong, they say, I've told you a thousand times not to wear your shoes in the house.

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Exactly, so it is a great phrase to really make your point that you've said something many, many times.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Moving on, we have a kind of like a conjunction that you can use, and it's by the way, to change the topic maybe, by the way.

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
By the way, and so by the way, we keep these words together, it's a fixed phrase.

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
By the way is something we add on, so I say, you know, today I went to school and I saw a lot of people.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, by the way, John says hi, all right, so while I'm talking about this, I want to add that this thing happened, or that this person said something.

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Exactly, so it is, it's a conjunction, right, to put together two different ideas.

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
By the way, or you can start off your sentence with it, by the way, how is the new house?

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, because it's like saying, oh, this thought just came into my head, by the way, da-da-da-da.

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Right, right, and our last phrase on Fluency Builder is, we are set.

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
All right, all we need is my Nintendo Wii, and we are set.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
All right, so what do we set?

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We are set.

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
All right, we are set is another one of those phrases that's fixed, and it literally, it means, and we are ready to start, we're ready to go.

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And everything is ready.

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, we don't need anything else, and so Marco, I could say to you, just bring the salad to the table and we're set, we're ready to eat.

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
All right, and I think we're set to listen to our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be right back and talk a little bit more about this great topic.

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm forming a music band.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Do you already know how to play an instrument?

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Uh, yeah, I told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums.

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.

167
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band?

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We have a guy who plays guitar, and another who plays bass, although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer.

169
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You told me that you had some musical talent, right?

170
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, I'm a singer.

171
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Perfect!

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So you can audition this weekend here at my house.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Great!

174
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Wait here?

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones, or even your drums.

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
By the way, where do you keep them or practice?

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Dude, what are you talking about?

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's right here.

179
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
All we need is my Nintendo Wii, and we're set.

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Alright, we're back.

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So, rock band.

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Now, I know that you play a real instrument, not only instruments on the Wii.

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
True!

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What do you play?

185
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Um, I play the trumpet.

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I was classically trained.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I started when I was ten.

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Now is this the trumpet that has the three buttons on the top?

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Three pistons.

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Three pistons.

191
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because there's another one that doesn't, right?

192
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There's one that has four pistons, it's a piccolo trumpet, it has four.

193
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And there's one that's large, and it slides in and out, and that's a trombone, that's much lower.

194
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Right, right.

195
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But the trumpet is kind of a mid-range instrument, it can go quite high and a little bit low.

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And it's brass, it's not wood, it's made of a metal.

197
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Right, it looks like gold, right?

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Right.

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Alright, so you play the trumpet, did you play in a band or in a school or college?

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:08,000
In high school, middle school and high school I played in bands and orchestras, and in college I played in orchestra, and I've also played in rock bands, because sometimes people want to, you know, have a trumpet in the background and go a little crazy.

201
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Nice, interesting.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is interesting because I'm sure a lot of our users out there actually play instruments and maybe a lot of them are also good at it, so come to EnglishPod.com, leave your questions and comments, and let us know if you play any instruments or maybe some strange instruments like the xylophone.

203
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Or if you like to play Wii rock band, because we certainly do and we can support you on that one.

204
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We can give you some tips.

205
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah.

206
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Alright, so we'll see you guys there, until next time.

207
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Bye everyone.
