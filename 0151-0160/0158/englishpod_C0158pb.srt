00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,139
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:05,860
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,119
And my name is Catherine, and today we have an exciting lesson for everyone out there, very cultural.

4
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:18,640
Exactly, and very closely related to our Halloween lesson that we had, but on this occasion we're going to be looking at All Saints Day.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:30,980
All right, so this is a festival that's celebrated in many different countries, and we're learning today about some of the ceremonies and practices in those countries that are very closely tied to those local cultures.

6
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:42,159
Exactly, so we're going to learn a little bit about culture, and at the same time we're going to learn some great words and phrases, so let's get started with this dialogue for the first time.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,380
The day of the dead has arrived!

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,060
All Souls Day and All Saints Day!

9
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,759
Your neighbor is crazy.

10
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,079
Why is he screaming that?

11
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,579
Because today is the first of November, the day of the dead.

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, that's right.

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,159
This is a very special day among many cultures around the world, especially in Latin America.

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:07,939
Seriously?

15
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:13,680
I thought it was just like any other day, except for the fact that people visit the cemetery and remember their loved ones.

16
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,700
Well, that's just part of it.

17
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
People across the world celebrate in different ways.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:30,540
In Mexico, for example, it's common to see people building private altars, honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, preparing the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,920
In the Philippines, the tombs are cleaned or repainted, candles are lit, and flowers are offered.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,620
Entire families camp out in cemeteries and sometimes spend a night or two near the relatives' tombs.

21
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,439
Whoa, that's scary.

22
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know if I could do that.

23
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:46,659
Why?

24
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,620
We should fear the living, not the dead.

25
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,180
And we're back, so did you know about these traditions in the Philippines and in Mexico?

26
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,599
I know about the Mexican ones because there's a lot of Mexicans where I come from, in Chicago, and they still celebrate these things.

27
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,040
But I didn't know about the Philippines, so I found this really interesting.

28
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:07,780
Interesting, right?

29
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:19,479
Actually, yeah, the Philippines as well as Mexico are very Catholic countries, so maybe that's one of the reasons why they have such, they have these events that are so important for their culture.

30
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,259
I'm sure, yeah.

31
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,740
All right, so before we start talking a little bit more about the culture, why don't we take a look at language takeaway?

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,680
Language takeaway.

33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,580
The first word is a very common word, especially if you're a church-going person.

34
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:36,860
The word is alter.

35
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,340
Okay, an alter.

36
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,099
An alter.

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,680
It's a thing.

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,259
It's a thing, and an alter is usually found inside a church, as you said, right?

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,840
So it's like a...

40
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,159
Table.

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,180
It's like a table.

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,039
Or a counter.

43
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:54,620
So the alter in the church is where the priest does all of the stuff that he does during the Mass.

44
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,960
It's where he prepares the bread and the wine, and it's essentially a table, yeah.

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,699
But you can build an alter for yourself in your garden, for example, right?

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,960
And it doesn't have to do with the Catholic religion, necessarily.

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
No, not necessarily.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,300
You could have an alter in a Greek pagan temple where you give offerings to a god or goddess.

49
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:20,960
And so in this case, an alter is a special religious table where you perform certain religious rites or functions.

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,360
Okay, very interesting.

51
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:29,439
All right, and so it's common in Mexico for people to build private altars honoring the deceased.

52
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,080
So what is this word, deceased?

53
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,780
All right, deceased is a noun.

54
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,560
It's a word that we use to call someone who's dead or departed.

55
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,979
So the deceased was named John Smith.

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,219
So it's like a more technical term of saying somebody is dead.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,479
Right, and it's something that you'll often read in the newspaper when they don't want to say the dead guy.

58
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:56,300
You know, they say the deceased was a doctor, and he is survived by three children.

59
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,319
And so deceased is a way to describe a person in a nicer way.

60
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,740
Right, very good, the deceased.

61
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,020
And you mentioned another word that's very closely related to deceased, the departed.

62
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:11,639
That's right, and this is actually a famous word because of a Martin Scorsese movie that came out about two years ago.

63
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:20,620
And departed, you know the word to depart, to leave, the person that is a departed is someone who has left us.

64
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,220
It's a dead person.

65
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:28,839
So you can say the deceased or the departed, which basically means the same thing as the dead guy or the dead person.

66
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,079
Exactly, but again, it's much more polite.

67
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,620
It's something that we hear often at funerals or that we read in magazines.

68
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,560
Okay, so for example, All Saints Day is a way of honoring the departed.

69
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,100
Exactly, very nice sounding.

70
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,220
Yeah, it sounds better.

71
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:54,160
Alright, so talking a little bit more about the departed and the traditions, it says here that many Mexicans use sugar skulls, or have sugar skulls during this festivity.

72
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:09,560
That's right, so a skull is the bones from a person's head, alright, and so you can often see these on, for example, pirate ships, we say skull and crossbones, and so it's the bones from a head and you have the bones underneath.

73
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:17,160
It's a very popular image on Halloween because it's scary, but a skull is essentially the bones from a head.

74
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,420
So it's like a person's head without the skin, eyes, lips, everything, right?

75
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:28,019
It's scary because it has empty black spaces where the eyes are supposed to be and you can see all the teeth, but nothing else.

76
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,139
What about the sugar skulls?

77
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:29,660
What are these?

78
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,899
They're skulls made of sugar.

79
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:56,699
That's right, and so they look like skulls because there's no cheeks and no, they're not really, there's no skin or eyes, but they're beautiful because the Mexicans in their tradition, they color the sugar, so you can have white skulls with this beautiful green and pink and red and blue decorations, and you can eat them because they're made of sugar, and so it's a special treat that people have in the Mexican tradition on the Day of the Dead.

80
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:57,600
Very good.

81
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:06,199
All right, and one of the many traditions, apart from sugar skulls and building private altars, they also visit the person's tomb, if possible, right?

82
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,300
Exactly, so a tomb is an important word.

83
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,879
So what is a tomb?

84
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:22,879
A tomb is a place where someone is buried, it's a space or a place, and it can be big or small, but it's essentially the resting place of a dead person.

85
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:23,379
All right.

86
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,639
So a tomb, where the person is, and actually on the tomb you have the tombstone, right?

87
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:39,899
That's right, and a tombstone is the same as a gravestone, and it's a piece of rock on which you write the name and the birth date and the death date of the person that is buried there.

88
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,480
Right, so that's the tombstone.

89
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,620
Very good.

90
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:50,740
Okay, so an interesting amount of words here on language takeaway, why don't we listen to this dialogue again, and we'll be right back with Fluency Builder.

91
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,720
Your neighbor is crazy, why is he screaming that?

92
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,160
Because today is the first of November, the day of the dead.

93
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Oh, that's right.

94
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,759
This is a very special day among many cultures around the world, especially in Latin America.

95
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:10,560
Seriously?

96
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:16,300
I thought it was just like any other day, except for the fact that people visit the cemetery and remember their loved ones.

97
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,360
Well, that's just part of it.

98
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,000
People across the world celebrate in different ways.

99
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:33,160
In Mexico, for example, it's common to see people building private altars honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, preparing the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.

100
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,540
In the Philippines, the tombs are cleaned or repainted, candles are lit, and flowers are offered.

101
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,279
Entire families camp out in cemeteries and sometimes spend a night or two near the relatives' tombs.

102
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,040
Whoa, that's scary.

103
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,639
I don't know if I could do that.

104
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,220
Why?

105
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,199
We should fear the living, not the dead.

106
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:58,959
All right, we're back, so why don't we look at three main phrases on Fluency Builder now.

107
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:09,060
Well, the first phrase should be obvious by now because it is the name of the holiday we're talking about, and the name is the Day of the Dead.

108
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:10,220
The Day of the Dead.

109
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,879
So this is their day.

110
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:18,779
It is, and it's the Day of the Dead because it's the day in which people around the world celebrate the departed.

111
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,720
It's when they talk about and remember people that they've loved who have died.

112
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,759
Okay, so it's not really like a sad day, right?

113
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,759
It's more of a happy remembering them and honoring them and how much you miss them, but in a good way.

114
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:52,059
Exactly, and you're not actually going to hear this very often in reference to American culture because it's not something Americans do and English people don't do either, but people when they're talking about their own families and traditions will want to talk about this because in the Philippines or in Latin America you have a very strong tradition of celebrating this.

115
00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:01,740
All right, and as we mentioned, this day is a day to honor or to remember your loved ones, and that's our second phrase, your loved ones.

116
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:13,500
The phrase loved ones might not be obvious to many people because you can love many people and many things, but loved ones is a phrase that generally means the people that you care about the most, your friends and your family.

117
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,960
So you could say, I want to have a party, but I only want my loved ones to be there.

118
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:22,059
Or he was in the hospital and all of his loved ones visited him.

119
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,600
So it's all those people, not necessarily only family, it's friends and family that you love.

120
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,379
Exactly, and so those are the people in the world that are the very closest to you.

121
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:45,960
Okay, and our last phrase and probably one of the most interesting traditions that we were able to see in this dialogue is that people in the Philippines camp out in cemeteries on their family or loved ones tomb.

122
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:57,679
That's right, so the phrase to camp out means to stay overnight to bring food and a tent or blankets, and it essentially means to make a camp so you can stay there.

123
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:02,720
And this is very unusual to me because I can't imagine sleeping in a graveyard, I think I get the goosebumps.

124
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,840
Right, so camp out or you can just say camp, right?

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,240
You don't really necessarily have to say both of them.

126
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,879
Right, you can camp or you can camp out, and camp out generally means that you're staying in a place that is temporary.

127
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:24,240
Okay, very good, so interesting phrases as well on Fluency Builder today, let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back.

128
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,179
Why is he screaming that?

129
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,639
Because today is the first of November, the day of the dead.

130
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,059
Oh, that's right.

131
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:50,240
This is a very special day among many cultures around the world, especially in Latin America.

132
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,039
Seriously?

133
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:56,779
I thought it was just like any other day, except for the fact that people visit the cemetery and remember their loved ones.

134
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,740
Well, that's just part of it.

135
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,480
People across the world celebrate in different ways.

136
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:13,600
In Mexico, for example, it's common to see people building private altars, honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, preparing the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.

137
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,000
In the Philippines, the tombs are cleaned or repainted, candles are lit, and flowers are offered.

138
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,659
Entire families camp out in cemeteries and sometimes spend a night or two near the relatives' tombs.

139
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,519
Whoa, that's scary.

140
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,059
I don't know if I could do that.

141
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:29,720
Why?

142
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,700
We should fear the living, not the dead.

143
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,080
All right, we're back.

144
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:51,919
So, Catherine, you mentioned that in Anglo-Saxon culture, England or in the United States, you don't have this type of tradition of honoring the dead or something like that, but you do visit the tomb of your loved ones or the cemetery as well, right?

145
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,379
People do, definitely.

146
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,320
But you just don't have a national day where you do this?

147
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,799
Well, Veterans Day is a day when we celebrate people who were killed in wars or people who participated in wars.

148
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,340
So in America, we have a day called Memorial Day in which we remember the people who have died serving the country in the military.

149
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,779
And so Memorial Day is a day in which many people like to go to the graveyards and to lay flowers or to remember the dead.

150
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
But it really depends on your family.

151
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,100
I mean, some people like to go the day a person died and on the anniversary or on a special day for them.

152
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,820
So it's very private and personal and individual.

153
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,799
It's not something that we all do on one particular day.

154
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,559
Right, right, right.

155
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:46,080
And I think what may strike many people as different is that you visit the cemetery and if you ever have the chance to be in Mexico or in a Hispanic country, you will see that it's full of people and it's actually a...

156
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:54,559
There's a lot of food and people are there eating on the tomb and they've actually prepared the food that was the deceased's favorite.

157
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:01,460
Wow, that's really nice though as a gesture because it's another way to remember the person and to celebrate how...

158
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,759
Like things that were happy for them.

159
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:09,419
Exactly, and it's a way of actually sharing a meal with that person even though that person isn't with you anymore in this world.

160
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,200
So yeah, it's actually very interesting.

161
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,759
It goes back again to a little bit of the culture and the folklore and everything from different countries.

162
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:26,080
But we want to know what you guys do or how you remember your deceased because each country has its own particular little very interesting way of doing it.

163
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:26,600
That's right.

164
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:35,000
So please share with us on our website, EnglishPod.com, your own traditions and the culture that you have in your home country or town.

165
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:40,700
And we're very curious to hear those, but also if you have questions as always, please ask because we're happy to answer those.

166
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,059
All right, so we'll see you guys there.

167
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,840
Bye everyone.

168
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:48,500
Bye.
