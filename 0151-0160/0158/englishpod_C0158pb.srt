00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And my name is Catherine, and today we have an exciting lesson for everyone out there, very cultural.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Exactly, and very closely related to our Halloween lesson that we had, but on this occasion we're going to be looking at All Saints Day.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All right, so this is a festival that's celebrated in many different countries, and we're learning today about some of the ceremonies and practices in those countries that are very closely tied to those local cultures.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Exactly, so we're going to learn a little bit about culture, and at the same time we're going to learn some great words and phrases, so let's get started with this dialogue for the first time.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The day of the dead has arrived!

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
All Souls Day and All Saints Day!

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Your neighbor is crazy.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Why is he screaming that?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Because today is the first of November, the day of the dead.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, that's right.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is a very special day among many cultures around the world, especially in Latin America.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Seriously?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I thought it was just like any other day, except for the fact that people visit the cemetery and remember their loved ones.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, that's just part of it.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
People across the world celebrate in different ways.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In Mexico, for example, it's common to see people building private altars, honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, preparing the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
In the Philippines, the tombs are cleaned or repainted, candles are lit, and flowers are offered.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Entire families camp out in cemeteries and sometimes spend a night or two near the relatives' tombs.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Whoa, that's scary.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know if I could do that.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why?

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We should fear the living, not the dead.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And we're back, so did you know about these traditions in the Philippines and in Mexico?

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I know about the Mexican ones because there's a lot of Mexicans where I come from, in Chicago, and they still celebrate these things.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But I didn't know about the Philippines, so I found this really interesting.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Interesting, right?

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Actually, yeah, the Philippines as well as Mexico are very Catholic countries, so maybe that's one of the reasons why they have such, they have these events that are so important for their culture.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sure, yeah.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All right, so before we start talking a little bit more about the culture, why don't we take a look at language takeaway?

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Language takeaway.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The first word is a very common word, especially if you're a church-going person.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The word is alter.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, an alter.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
An alter.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's a thing.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's a thing, and an alter is usually found inside a church, as you said, right?

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So it's like a...

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Table.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's like a table.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Or a counter.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So the alter in the church is where the priest does all of the stuff that he does during the Mass.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's where he prepares the bread and the wine, and it's essentially a table, yeah.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But you can build an alter for yourself in your garden, for example, right?

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And it doesn't have to do with the Catholic religion, necessarily.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, not necessarily.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You could have an alter in a Greek pagan temple where you give offerings to a god or goddess.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And so in this case, an alter is a special religious table where you perform certain religious rites or functions.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, very interesting.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
All right, and so it's common in Mexico for people to build private altars honoring the deceased.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So what is this word, deceased?

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
All right, deceased is a noun.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a word that we use to call someone who's dead or departed.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So the deceased was named John Smith.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So it's like a more technical term of saying somebody is dead.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Right, and it's something that you'll often read in the newspaper when they don't want to say the dead guy.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You know, they say the deceased was a doctor, and he is survived by three children.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And so deceased is a way to describe a person in a nicer way.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Right, very good, the deceased.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And you mentioned another word that's very closely related to deceased, the departed.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's right, and this is actually a famous word because of a Martin Scorsese movie that came out about two years ago.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And departed, you know the word to depart, to leave, the person that is a departed is someone who has left us.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a dead person.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So you can say the deceased or the departed, which basically means the same thing as the dead guy or the dead person.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Exactly, but again, it's much more polite.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's something that we hear often at funerals or that we read in magazines.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, so for example, All Saints Day is a way of honoring the departed.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Exactly, very nice sounding.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah, it sounds better.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Alright, so talking a little bit more about the departed and the traditions, it says here that many Mexicans use sugar skulls, or have sugar skulls during this festivity.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's right, so a skull is the bones from a person's head, alright, and so you can often see these on, for example, pirate ships, we say skull and crossbones, and so it's the bones from a head and you have the bones underneath.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a very popular image on Halloween because it's scary, but a skull is essentially the bones from a head.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So it's like a person's head without the skin, eyes, lips, everything, right?

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's scary because it has empty black spaces where the eyes are supposed to be and you can see all the teeth, but nothing else.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What about the sugar skulls?

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What are these?

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
They're skulls made of sugar.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's right, and so they look like skulls because there's no cheeks and no, they're not really, there's no skin or eyes, but they're beautiful because the Mexicans in their tradition, they color the sugar, so you can have white skulls with this beautiful green and pink and red and blue decorations, and you can eat them because they're made of sugar, and so it's a special treat that people have in the Mexican tradition on the Day of the Dead.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Very good.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All right, and one of the many traditions, apart from sugar skulls and building private altars, they also visit the person's tomb, if possible, right?

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Exactly, so a tomb is an important word.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So what is a tomb?

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,000
A tomb is a place where someone is buried, it's a space or a place, and it can be big or small, but it's essentially the resting place of a dead person.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
All right.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So a tomb, where the person is, and actually on the tomb you have the tombstone, right?

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's right, and a tombstone is the same as a gravestone, and it's a piece of rock on which you write the name and the birth date and the death date of the person that is buried there.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Right, so that's the tombstone.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Very good.

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay, so an interesting amount of words here on language takeaway, why don't we listen to this dialogue again, and we'll be right back with Fluency Builder.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Your neighbor is crazy, why is he screaming that?

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Because today is the first of November, the day of the dead.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, that's right.

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is a very special day among many cultures around the world, especially in Latin America.

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Seriously?

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I thought it was just like any other day, except for the fact that people visit the cemetery and remember their loved ones.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, that's just part of it.

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
People across the world celebrate in different ways.

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In Mexico, for example, it's common to see people building private altars honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, preparing the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In the Philippines, the tombs are cleaned or repainted, candles are lit, and flowers are offered.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Entire families camp out in cemeteries and sometimes spend a night or two near the relatives' tombs.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Whoa, that's scary.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know if I could do that.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why?

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We should fear the living, not the dead.

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
All right, we're back, so why don't we look at three main phrases on Fluency Builder now.

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, the first phrase should be obvious by now because it is the name of the holiday we're talking about, and the name is the Day of the Dead.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The Day of the Dead.

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So this is their day.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It is, and it's the Day of the Dead because it's the day in which people around the world celebrate the departed.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's when they talk about and remember people that they've loved who have died.

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, so it's not really like a sad day, right?

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's more of a happy remembering them and honoring them and how much you miss them, but in a good way.

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Exactly, and you're not actually going to hear this very often in reference to American culture because it's not something Americans do and English people don't do either, but people when they're talking about their own families and traditions will want to talk about this because in the Philippines or in Latin America you have a very strong tradition of celebrating this.

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
All right, and as we mentioned, this day is a day to honor or to remember your loved ones, and that's our second phrase, your loved ones.

116
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The phrase loved ones might not be obvious to many people because you can love many people and many things, but loved ones is a phrase that generally means the people that you care about the most, your friends and your family.

117
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So you could say, I want to have a party, but I only want my loved ones to be there.

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Or he was in the hospital and all of his loved ones visited him.

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So it's all those people, not necessarily only family, it's friends and family that you love.

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Exactly, and so those are the people in the world that are the very closest to you.

121
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, and our last phrase and probably one of the most interesting traditions that we were able to see in this dialogue is that people in the Philippines camp out in cemeteries on their family or loved ones tomb.

122
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's right, so the phrase to camp out means to stay overnight to bring food and a tent or blankets, and it essentially means to make a camp so you can stay there.

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And this is very unusual to me because I can't imagine sleeping in a graveyard, I think I get the goosebumps.

124
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Right, so camp out or you can just say camp, right?

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You don't really necessarily have to say both of them.

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Right, you can camp or you can camp out, and camp out generally means that you're staying in a place that is temporary.

127
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay, very good, so interesting phrases as well on Fluency Builder today, let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back.

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Why is he screaming that?

129
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Because today is the first of November, the day of the dead.

130
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, that's right.

131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This is a very special day among many cultures around the world, especially in Latin America.

132
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Seriously?

133
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I thought it was just like any other day, except for the fact that people visit the cemetery and remember their loved ones.

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, that's just part of it.

135
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
People across the world celebrate in different ways.

136
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:13,000
In Mexico, for example, it's common to see people building private altars, honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, preparing the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.

137
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
In the Philippines, the tombs are cleaned or repainted, candles are lit, and flowers are offered.

138
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Entire families camp out in cemeteries and sometimes spend a night or two near the relatives' tombs.

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Whoa, that's scary.

140
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't know if I could do that.

141
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Why?

142
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We should fear the living, not the dead.

143
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
All right, we're back.

144
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So, Catherine, you mentioned that in Anglo-Saxon culture, England or in the United States, you don't have this type of tradition of honoring the dead or something like that, but you do visit the tomb of your loved ones or the cemetery as well, right?

145
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
People do, definitely.

146
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But you just don't have a national day where you do this?

147
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, Veterans Day is a day when we celebrate people who were killed in wars or people who participated in wars.

148
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So in America, we have a day called Memorial Day in which we remember the people who have died serving the country in the military.

149
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And so Memorial Day is a day in which many people like to go to the graveyards and to lay flowers or to remember the dead.

150
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But it really depends on your family.

151
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I mean, some people like to go the day a person died and on the anniversary or on a special day for them.

152
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So it's very private and personal and individual.

153
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's not something that we all do on one particular day.

154
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Right, right, right.

155
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And I think what may strike many people as different is that you visit the cemetery and if you ever have the chance to be in Mexico or in a Hispanic country, you will see that it's full of people and it's actually a...

156
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There's a lot of food and people are there eating on the tomb and they've actually prepared the food that was the deceased's favorite.

157
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Wow, that's really nice though as a gesture because it's another way to remember the person and to celebrate how...

158
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Like things that were happy for them.

159
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Exactly, and it's a way of actually sharing a meal with that person even though that person isn't with you anymore in this world.

160
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So yeah, it's actually very interesting.

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It goes back again to a little bit of the culture and the folklore and everything from different countries.

162
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But we want to know what you guys do or how you remember your deceased because each country has its own particular little very interesting way of doing it.

163
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's right.

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So please share with us on our website, EnglishPod.com, your own traditions and the culture that you have in your home country or town.

165
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And we're very curious to hear those, but also if you have questions as always, please ask because we're happy to answer those.

166
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
All right, so we'll see you guys there.

167
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Bye everyone.

168
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Bye.
