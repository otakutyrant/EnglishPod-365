1
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,640
The day of the dead has arrived!

2
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:11,320
All souls day and all saints day!

3
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,380
Your neighbor is crazy, why is he screaming that?

4
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,820
Because today is the first of November, the day of the dead.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,239
Oh, that's right.

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:24,420
This is a very special day among many cultures around the world, especially in Latin America.

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:25,199
Seriously?

8
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:30,940
I thought it was just like any other day, except for the fact that people visit the cemetery and remember their loved ones.

9
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,899
Well, that's just part of it.

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,659
People across the world celebrate in different ways.

11
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:47,799
In Mexico, for example, it's common to see people building private altars, honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, preparing the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,200
In the Philippines, the tombs are cleaned or repainted, candles are lit, and flowers are offered.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,140
Entire families camp out in cemeteries and sometimes spend a night or two near the relatives tombs.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,679
Woah, that's scary.

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,240
I don't know if I could do that.

16
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:03,899
Why?

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,859
We should fear the living, not the dead.
