1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The day of the dead has arrived!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
All souls day and all saints day!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Your neighbor is crazy, why is he screaming that?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Because today is the first of November, the day of the dead.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, that's right.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is a very special day among many cultures around the world, especially in Latin America.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Seriously?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I thought it was just like any other day, except for the fact that people visit the cemetery and remember their loved ones.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, that's just part of it.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
People across the world celebrate in different ways.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In Mexico, for example, it's common to see people building private altars, honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, preparing the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In the Philippines, the tombs are cleaned or repainted, candles are lit, and flowers are offered.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Entire families camp out in cemeteries and sometimes spend a night or two near the relatives tombs.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Woah, that's scary.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't know if I could do that.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why?

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We should fear the living, not the dead.
