00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name is Katherine.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So, as usual, we've got a great dialogue for you today.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And before we get going, I should mention what the topic is.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So, Marco, take it away.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We are actually having a small fight at the office.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Somebody or a co-worker is annoying us, so, you know, sometimes co-workers, you see them every day, they're doing something that's maybe getting on your nerves.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And you practically live together because you're with each other for 8, 9, 10 hours every day.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Exactly.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So that's what we're going to be looking at today, some language related to this topic.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Cut what out?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not doing anything.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The tapping of your pen on your desk?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's driving me crazy.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Fine.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
By the way, would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't slurp my coffee.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And plus, how can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You've got to be kidding me.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But it's probably not a good idea to keep it up.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Fine.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's call a truce.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll try to be more considerate and keep the noise down.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, I'll try to do the same.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So I was wondering, do you want to go out to dinner Friday night?

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All right, we're back.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So yeah, I think this is a common situation, right?

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So common, this might even be based on our own lives.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It is.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You may not know, but Catherine and I get into fights all the time.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
All the time.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, not really.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All right.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So I think there was some interesting words here, but mostly phrases.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So let's start with the words first.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Language takeaway.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Language takeaway.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
All right, so the first word, as you might have guessed, has to do with eating and drinking.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is called slurping.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
To slurp.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
To slurp.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So the noun, the thing, is slurping.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And it's very common with people who eat their food quickly.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Like soup.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, soup.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Or you know.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Noodles.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, or when they're eating soup noodles.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Or sometimes when you have a drink and you're drinking it through a straw, towards the end, you're just like trying to get the very last part at the bottom.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So yeah, the straw slurps.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, so slurping, some people really can't stand it.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sometimes you don't even notice that you're doing it.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, absolutely not.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All right, so apart from slurping, what else do we have?

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We've got a great word here, accumulated.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So a lot of accumulated anger.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The word is a verb, to accumulate.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And what does that mean?

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It means to kind of grow or to become more and more.

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All right.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So you're like saving it.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Or even it's like building up.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You know, we say this oftentimes in Chicago, where it snows a lot in the winter, that there's a foot of snow accumulated on the ground.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That means there's a lot of snow.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And every time it snows, it keeps getting bigger.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All right.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So to accumulate.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So accumulated anger, your anger is getting bigger and bigger.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right, because you never tell anyone about your anger.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So it keeps building and it keeps piling up.

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
All right.

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, towards the end, they said, well, let's call a truce.

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So they want to call a truce.

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
All right, a truce is another word for peace.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And so this is a way that you can stop fighting and say that you and I have been fighting for a long time.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We may not come to a deal, but we'll say truce from now on.

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We just won't fight.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Won't fight about it.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Brothers and sisters often call truces.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Truce.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And well, if you're calling a truce, you're trying to be more considerate.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
OK, considerate, like you're saying, is a way to be or a way to act.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And considerate often has to do with how you act towards other people.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So it's being nice to other people or thinking about other people's feelings before yourself.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
All right.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So if you're considerate, then you are maybe more polite.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You think about the other person's feelings before you do anything.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Exactly.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You just say nice little things like please and thank you and I'm sorry.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And these things are all ways of being considerate.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Very good.

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All right.

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So four great words on language takeaway.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Why don't we move on now to fluency builder.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All right.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So as we mentioned, this dialog is very, very rich in a lot of different phrases.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So let's start with a couple of them.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The very first one and the title of the lesson.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Cut it out.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Cut that out.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Right.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So you're not actually saying to cut something with scissors or something.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, this is it's a way of saying.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Can you stop that?

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Stop it.

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Stop doing that.

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Stop it.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Quit it.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Cut that out.

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Cut it out.

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So if someone's doing something that's really annoying to you, it's not very nice to say, but you can say, hey, cut that out.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Cut it out.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Or if someone's doing something mean to someone like my brother used to hit me, my mom would say, Peter, cut that out.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
All right.

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So it is a good mom phrase as well.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
All right.

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Moving on to our next phrase.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The guy said that the tapping on the desk was driving him crazy.

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's driving me crazy.

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All right.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
To drive someone crazy means to make someone just feel like they're going nuts or, you know, it just it makes you kind of angry or frustrated or tense.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But it can also be used like in in a romantic sense.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Right.

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That girl drives me crazy.

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It means like he can't even think about anything else.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
All right.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So in this case, what drives you crazy?

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:19,000
When I'll tell you what drives me crazy, when people clip their fingernails and toenails at the office, I can't believe well, it drives me crazy, like, for example, when somebody or my brother leaves his clothes lying on the floor in the living room.

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's annoying, too.

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

141
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So that drives me crazy.

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
All right.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So moving on to our third phrase.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is a pretty big one.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But take it as a whole.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You've got to be kidding me.

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
All right.

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So this is, as you said, a fixed phrase.

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
These words usually go together and it is a perfect example of sarcasm.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So it's a way the way you say it is very important.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So I could say, oh, you've got to be kidding me.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What's a good what's a good situation for this?

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Maybe I get to the airport and I'm running late and I'm really happy that I get there on time.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And then I see the flight is delayed seven hours.

155
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You've got to be kidding me.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Right.

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So it's a way of saying I can't believe it or seriously, this isn't.

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah.

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's happening?

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What bad luck.

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Right.

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So it is a sarcastic phrase, but use it as a whole.

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Usually you don't change the subject.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You don't say you've got to be kidding him or no.

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's always this.

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You've got to be kidding me.

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
All right.

168
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Or you've got to be kidding me.

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
See different meanings with different inflections, inflections.

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Very good.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's our next phrase?

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Our next phrase is a good one because it doesn't mean what it sounds like.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
OK, so to shoot the breeze.

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
All right.

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Shoot means like you can shoot a gun and breeze is like the wind.

176
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But here to shoot the breeze is to have a nice little conversation just to talk about nothing.

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
OK, so not really do anything.

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Just talk a little bit.

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Right.

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So if we think about this in the context of this sentence, it's you know, you go out for your cigarette break 10 times a day to shoot the breeze.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So this means you go outside, you just talk about nothing and whatever.

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And it's almost like you're wasting time just talking.

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
OK, so shooting the breeze.

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You can say, oh, we were just shooting the breeze.

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Just have a nice little conversation.

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Nothing important.

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
OK.

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And our last phrase for today, forgive and forget.

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's forgive and forget.

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's forgive and forget.

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is these words again, like the last phrases go together.

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Forgive and forget.

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So I could say this to you, Marco.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I say, I know you've been fighting with your brother for 10 years.

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I say finally just forgive and forget.

196
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That means just put everything behind you and try and start again.

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
OK, let it go.

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah, forgive the person, forget about it, move on.

199
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
OK, forgive and forget.

200
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Very good.

201
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So very interesting phrases.

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think they're very useful.

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And this is very colloquial English, right?

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Absolutely.

205
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
This is stuff that you're going to hear all the time, but maybe not all together at the same time.

206
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Definitely, though, very helpful for interacting with foreign friends and colleagues.

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Very good.

208
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back.

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're putting into your phone all the time.

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You've got to be kidding me.

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break 10 times a day to shoot the breeze?

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it's probably OK to let off steam once in a while, but it's probably not a good idea to keep it up.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are.

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Fine, let's call a truce.

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll try to be more considerate and keep the noise down.

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, I'll try to do the same.

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So I was wondering, you want to go out to dinner Friday night?

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So did you ever see the TV show Full House when you were a kid?

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I did.

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I did.

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It was a popular one with the Olsen twins and all those, right?

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, and Bob Saget.

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So there was an uncle on the show, Uncle Joey, and he always used to say, cut it out.

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And he had like hand motions for it.

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And so cut it out as a way to say kind of stop it, quit it, you're killing me.

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's like he was saying too funny.

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And so whenever I hear this phrase, I always think of that early 90s TV show.

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Very early 90s.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, this whole situation with The Office as well, I think there was a TV show called The Office, right?

230
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, there was the British Office and then there was an American version.

231
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And it's also something about office life and how colleagues get on each other's nerves and they play pranks on each other and everyone's kind of weird.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And everyone drives everyone else crazy.

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No, it's funny because once you start working in an office full time, I mean, everyone's maybe had a little bit of office experience, but when it's full time, you spend more time with your colleagues than you do with your family.

234
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's really amazing what makes you crazy, what drives you crazy and what stuff just doesn't matter.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So this is an interesting topic.

236
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We really want to hear from you guys.

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Many of you probably work at an office, so tell us.

238
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So come and tell us what drives you crazy or maybe what colleague is driving you mad.

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You don't have to use names.

240
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You can just use nicknames if you want.

241
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So we'll be waiting for you at EnglishPod.com, leave questions and comments and we'll see you guys next time.

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yep.

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Bye everyone.

244
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Bye.
