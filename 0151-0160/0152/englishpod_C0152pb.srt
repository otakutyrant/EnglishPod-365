00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,280
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,019
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:08,880
And my name is Katherine.

4
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:11,800
So, as usual, we've got a great dialogue for you today.

5
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,320
And before we get going, I should mention what the topic is.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,300
So, Marco, take it away.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,480
We are actually having a small fight at the office.

8
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:27,079
Somebody or a co-worker is annoying us, so, you know, sometimes co-workers, you see them every day, they're doing something that's maybe getting on your nerves.

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:32,740
And you practically live together because you're with each other for 8, 9, 10 hours every day.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,299
Exactly.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,659
So that's what we're going to be looking at today, some language related to this topic.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,939
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

13
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,299
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?

14
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,420
Cut what out?

15
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,619
I'm not doing anything.

16
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,320
The tapping of your pen on your desk?

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,939
It's driving me crazy.

18
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,020
Fine.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,719
By the way, would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup?

20
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,619
I don't slurp my coffee.

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,040
And plus, how can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,239
You've got to be kidding me.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,939
You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze?

24
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,620
Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions.

25
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,920
And it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while.

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,459
But it's probably not a good idea to keep it up.

27
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,480
I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are.

28
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:30,000
Fine.

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,340
Let's call a truce.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,799
I'll try to be more considerate and keep the noise down.

31
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,760
Yeah, I'll try to do the same.

32
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,180
So I was wondering, do you want to go out to dinner Friday night?

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,920
All right, we're back.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,959
So yeah, I think this is a common situation, right?

35
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,560
So common, this might even be based on our own lives.

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,000
It is.

37
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:00,459
You may not know, but Catherine and I get into fights all the time.

38
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,260
All the time.

39
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:02,579
No, not really.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,239
All right.

41
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,939
So I think there was some interesting words here, but mostly phrases.

42
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,280
So let's start with the words first.

43
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:10,439
Language takeaway.

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,860
Language takeaway.

45
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:19,780
All right, so the first word, as you might have guessed, has to do with eating and drinking.

46
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,139
This is called slurping.

47
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,599
To slurp.

48
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:23,340
To slurp.

49
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,340
So the noun, the thing, is slurping.

50
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,939
And it's very common with people who eat their food quickly.

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,240
Like soup.

52
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,379
Yeah, soup.

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,319
Or you know.

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,419
Noodles.

55
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,919
Yeah, or when they're eating soup noodles.

56
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:47,539
Or sometimes when you have a drink and you're drinking it through a straw, towards the end, you're just like trying to get the very last part at the bottom.

57
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,400
So yeah, the straw slurps.

58
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,919
Yeah, so slurping, some people really can't stand it.

59
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,780
Sometimes you don't even notice that you're doing it.

60
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,979
No, absolutely not.

61
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,120
All right, so apart from slurping, what else do we have?

62
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,439
We've got a great word here, accumulated.

63
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:04,960
So a lot of accumulated anger.

64
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,460
The word is a verb, to accumulate.

65
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,740
And what does that mean?

66
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,659
It means to kind of grow or to become more and more.

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,340
All right.

68
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,039
So you're like saving it.

69
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,460
Or even it's like building up.

70
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:24,520
You know, we say this oftentimes in Chicago, where it snows a lot in the winter, that there's a foot of snow accumulated on the ground.

71
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,560
That means there's a lot of snow.

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,699
And every time it snows, it keeps getting bigger.

73
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,319
Yeah.

74
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:30,199
All right.

75
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:30,840
So to accumulate.

76
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,919
So accumulated anger, your anger is getting bigger and bigger.

77
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,900
Right, because you never tell anyone about your anger.

78
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,560
So it keeps building and it keeps piling up.

79
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,360
All right.

80
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,620
Well, towards the end, they said, well, let's call a truce.

81
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,479
So they want to call a truce.

82
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,439
All right, a truce is another word for peace.

83
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:52,740
And so this is a way that you can stop fighting and say that you and I have been fighting for a long time.

84
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,479
We may not come to a deal, but we'll say truce from now on.

85
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,639
We just won't fight.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,639
Won't fight about it.

87
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,979
Brothers and sisters often call truces.

88
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:01,800
Truce.

89
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,319
And well, if you're calling a truce, you're trying to be more considerate.

90
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,319
OK, considerate, like you're saying, is a way to be or a way to act.

91
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,740
And considerate often has to do with how you act towards other people.

92
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,660
So it's being nice to other people or thinking about other people's feelings before yourself.

93
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,220
All right.

94
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,100
So if you're considerate, then you are maybe more polite.

95
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,079
You think about the other person's feelings before you do anything.

96
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:27,639
Exactly.

97
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,100
You just say nice little things like please and thank you and I'm sorry.

98
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,220
And these things are all ways of being considerate.

99
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:34,879
Very good.

100
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:35,740
All right.

101
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,980
So four great words on language takeaway.

102
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,379
Why don't we move on now to fluency builder.

103
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:45,819
All right.

104
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,439
So as we mentioned, this dialog is very, very rich in a lot of different phrases.

105
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,980
So let's start with a couple of them.

106
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
The very first one and the title of the lesson.

107
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,220
Cut it out.

108
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,339
Cut that out.

109
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,959
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?

110
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,500
Right.

111
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,480
So you're not actually saying to cut something with scissors or something.

112
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,199
No, this is it's a way of saying.

113
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,420
Can you stop that?

114
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,160
Stop it.

115
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:09,939
Stop doing that.

116
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,500
Stop it.

117
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,300
Quit it.

118
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,779
Cut that out.

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,379
Cut it out.

120
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:20,040
So if someone's doing something that's really annoying to you, it's not very nice to say, but you can say, hey, cut that out.

121
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:20,939
Cut it out.

122
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,600
Or if someone's doing something mean to someone like my brother used to hit me, my mom would say, Peter, cut that out.

123
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:28,040
All right.

124
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,939
So it is a good mom phrase as well.

125
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,079
All right.

126
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,920
Moving on to our next phrase.

127
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,379
The guy said that the tapping on the desk was driving him crazy.

128
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
It's driving me crazy.

129
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,040
All right.

130
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:50,259
To drive someone crazy means to make someone just feel like they're going nuts or, you know, it just it makes you kind of angry or frustrated or tense.

131
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,199
But it can also be used like in in a romantic sense.

132
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,420
Right.

133
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,800
That girl drives me crazy.

134
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,959
It means like he can't even think about anything else.

135
00:05:59,439 --> 00:05:59,819
All right.

136
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,040
So in this case, what drives you crazy?

137
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:19,300
When I'll tell you what drives me crazy, when people clip their fingernails and toenails at the office, I can't believe well, it drives me crazy, like, for example, when somebody or my brother leaves his clothes lying on the floor in the living room.

138
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,579
That's annoying, too.

139
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:21,019
Yeah.

140
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:21,399
Yeah.

141
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,699
So that drives me crazy.

142
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:23,439
All right.

143
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,839
So moving on to our third phrase.

144
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,319
This is a pretty big one.

145
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,379
But take it as a whole.

146
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,379
You've got to be kidding me.

147
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,040
All right.

148
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,800
So this is, as you said, a fixed phrase.

149
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,060
These words usually go together and it is a perfect example of sarcasm.

150
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,120
So it's a way the way you say it is very important.

151
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,339
So I could say, oh, you've got to be kidding me.

152
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,959
What's a good what's a good situation for this?

153
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:53,740
Maybe I get to the airport and I'm running late and I'm really happy that I get there on time.

154
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,579
And then I see the flight is delayed seven hours.

155
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,699
You've got to be kidding me.

156
00:06:59,879 --> 00:06:59,959
Right.

157
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,620
So it's a way of saying I can't believe it or seriously, this isn't.

158
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:03,920
Yeah.

159
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,660
What's happening?

160
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,639
What bad luck.

161
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:06,439
Right.

162
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,480
So it is a sarcastic phrase, but use it as a whole.

163
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,379
Usually you don't change the subject.

164
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,579
You don't say you've got to be kidding him or no.

165
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,300
It's always this.

166
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,139
You've got to be kidding me.

167
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:16,800
All right.

168
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,480
Or you've got to be kidding me.

169
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,740
See different meanings with different inflections, inflections.

170
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,379
Very good.

171
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:24,920
What's our next phrase?

172
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,459
Our next phrase is a good one because it doesn't mean what it sounds like.

173
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,120
OK, so to shoot the breeze.

174
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,120
All right.

175
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,079
Shoot means like you can shoot a gun and breeze is like the wind.

176
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,860
But here to shoot the breeze is to have a nice little conversation just to talk about nothing.

177
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,860
OK, so not really do anything.

178
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,079
Just talk a little bit.

179
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:46,639
Right.

180
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,939
So if we think about this in the context of this sentence, it's you know, you go out for your cigarette break 10 times a day to shoot the breeze.

181
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,860
So this means you go outside, you just talk about nothing and whatever.

182
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,300
And it's almost like you're wasting time just talking.

183
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,600
OK, so shooting the breeze.

184
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,879
You can say, oh, we were just shooting the breeze.

185
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Just have a nice little conversation.

186
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,240
Nothing important.

187
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:06,920
OK.

188
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,600
And our last phrase for today, forgive and forget.

189
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,699
Let's forgive and forget.

190
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,240
Let's forgive and forget.

191
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,019
This is these words again, like the last phrases go together.

192
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,360
Forgive and forget.

193
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,800
So I could say this to you, Marco.

194
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,199
I say, I know you've been fighting with your brother for 10 years.

195
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,100
I say finally just forgive and forget.

196
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,259
That means just put everything behind you and try and start again.

197
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,540
OK, let it go.

198
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,200
Yeah, forgive the person, forget about it, move on.

199
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,899
OK, forgive and forget.

200
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:36,919
Very good.

201
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,419
So very interesting phrases.

202
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,039
I think they're very useful.

203
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,759
And this is very colloquial English, right?

204
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,419
Absolutely.

205
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,379
This is stuff that you're going to hear all the time, but maybe not all together at the same time.

206
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,639
Definitely, though, very helpful for interacting with foreign friends and colleagues.

207
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,259
Very good.

208
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,080
So let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back.

209
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,620
You're putting into your phone all the time.

210
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,799
You've got to be kidding me.

211
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:33,539
You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break 10 times a day to shoot the breeze?

212
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:44,019
Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it's probably OK to let off steam once in a while, but it's probably not a good idea to keep it up.

213
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,980
I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are.

214
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,919
Fine, let's call a truce.

215
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,379
I'll try to be more considerate and keep the noise down.

216
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,340
Yeah, I'll try to do the same.

217
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,759
So I was wondering, you want to go out to dinner Friday night?

218
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,419
So did you ever see the TV show Full House when you were a kid?

219
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:10,600
I did.

220
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,120
I did.

221
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,879
It was a popular one with the Olsen twins and all those, right?

222
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,340
Yeah, and Bob Saget.

223
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:26,500
So there was an uncle on the show, Uncle Joey, and he always used to say, cut it out.

224
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,080
And he had like hand motions for it.

225
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,700
And so cut it out as a way to say kind of stop it, quit it, you're killing me.

226
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,799
It's like he was saying too funny.

227
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,580
And so whenever I hear this phrase, I always think of that early 90s TV show.

228
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,080
Very early 90s.

229
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:48,299
Well, this whole situation with The Office as well, I think there was a TV show called The Office, right?

230
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,740
Yeah, there was the British Office and then there was an American version.

231
00:10:52,519 --> 00:11:00,259
And it's also something about office life and how colleagues get on each other's nerves and they play pranks on each other and everyone's kind of weird.

232
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:03,019
And everyone drives everyone else crazy.

233
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:15,620
No, it's funny because once you start working in an office full time, I mean, everyone's maybe had a little bit of office experience, but when it's full time, you spend more time with your colleagues than you do with your family.

234
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:22,220
It's really amazing what makes you crazy, what drives you crazy and what stuff just doesn't matter.

235
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,879
So this is an interesting topic.

236
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,460
We really want to hear from you guys.

237
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,320
Many of you probably work at an office, so tell us.

238
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,799
So come and tell us what drives you crazy or maybe what colleague is driving you mad.

239
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
You don't have to use names.

240
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,139
You can just use nicknames if you want.

241
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,360
So we'll be waiting for you at EnglishPod.com, leave questions and comments and we'll see you guys next time.

242
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:44,759
Yep.

243
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,399
Bye everyone.

244
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:45,659
Bye.
