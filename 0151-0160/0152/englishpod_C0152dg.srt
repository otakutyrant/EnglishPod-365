1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:08,080
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,199
Cut what out?

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,419
I'm not doing anything.

4
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:13,119
The tapping of your pen on your desk?

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,740
It's driving me crazy.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:15,800
Fine.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,519
By the way, would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup?

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,420
I don't slurp my coffee.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,859
And plus, how can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,059
You've got to be kidding me.

11
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:35,799
You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze?

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:43,740
Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions, and it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while.

13
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,280
But it's probably not a good idea to keep it up.

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,259
I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:49,799
Fine.

16
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,140
Let's call a truce.

17
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,579
I'll try to be more considerate and keep the noise down.

18
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,579
Yeah, I'll try to do the same.

19
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,000
So, I was wondering, do you want to go out to dinner Friday night?
