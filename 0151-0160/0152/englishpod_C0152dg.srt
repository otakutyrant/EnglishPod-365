1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Cut what out?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not doing anything.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The tapping of your pen on your desk?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's driving me crazy.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Fine.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
By the way, would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I don't slurp my coffee.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And plus, how can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You've got to be kidding me.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions, and it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But it's probably not a good idea to keep it up.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Fine.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's call a truce.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll try to be more considerate and keep the noise down.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, I'll try to do the same.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, I was wondering, do you want to go out to dinner Friday night?
