EnglishPod.com Hello, sir.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,759
How may I help you?

3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,820
I would like to buy some flowers, please.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,099
Something really nice.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,059
I see.

6
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:17,719
May I ask what the occasion is?

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,219
It's not really an occasion.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,640
It's more like I'm sorry.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,699
Very well.

10
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:26,059
This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends.

11
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:31,120
It has a dozen long-stemmed red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out.

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,640
It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,380
I think I'm going to need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,719
What else do you recommend?

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,700
Well, this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package.

16
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,219
Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies.

17
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,079
The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

18
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,320
I don't think that's going to cut it.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,719
I need something bigger and better.

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,060
I'm sorry, sir, but what exactly did you do?

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,280
Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,659
Get out of my store, you jerk!
