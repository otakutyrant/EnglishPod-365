EnglishPod.com Hello, sir.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How may I help you?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I would like to buy some flowers, please.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Something really nice.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I see.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
May I ask what the occasion is?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's not really an occasion.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's more like I'm sorry.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Very well.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It has a dozen long-stemmed red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I think I'm going to need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What else do you recommend?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't think that's going to cut it.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I need something bigger and better.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry, sir, but what exactly did you do?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Get out of my store, you jerk!
