00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name is Katherine, welcome back everyone.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So what are we talking about today, Marco?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are going to the flower shop.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay, so this is an intermediate level lesson, and we're going to be learning about the different kinds of flowers you can buy at a flower shop.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And so we've got a guy here who's probably trying to say something to someone he loves.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, I think he did something to his girlfriend or wife.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And well, that's the typical thing, right?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You do something wrong, so you got to get her flowers.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And that's why women are often very nervous when their husband or boyfriend gives them flowers because she's thinking, what did he do wrong?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue and we'll be back soon.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hello, sir.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How may I help you?

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I would like to buy some flowers, please.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Something really nice.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
May I ask what the occasion is?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's not really an occasion.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's more like I'm sorry.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Very well.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I think I'm going to need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What else do you recommend?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't think that's going to cut it.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I need something bigger and better.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry, sir, but what exactly did you do?

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Get out of my store, you jerk.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So what do you think?

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Is this really like a bad thing to do?

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Heck yeah.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No, really?

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, no one wants to hear that someone thinks they're fat.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
OK, and chubby is maybe not as bad as fat, but the guy could have been a little bit nicer.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right, so we'll give our listeners some advice towards the end of the lesson.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So now why don't we take a look at all the flower names in language takeaway?

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
OK, this first flower is a beautiful one, and it has delicious seeds that people like to eat.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's called a sunflower.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A sunflower.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All right, so that's a yellow flower, right?

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's bright yellow, and in the middle is orange, and the stems are very, very long.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And thick.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, and thick.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So it's a tall flower.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
OK, sunflower.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And yeah, as you mentioned, some people eat sunflower seeds.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They're like the little salty ones, right?

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right, they're really good.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
All right, next is an orchid.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
OK, an orchid is a beautiful flower, and they're often grown just one at a time, and people collect orchids, so these can be very, very expensive.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They're very expensive.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And they come in all shapes, sizes, and colors.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
OK, an orchid.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now what about a tulip?

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A tulip is another pretty flower, and I think they're most famous in Holland for their tulips, because this actually used to be the kind of money that they would use.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This was their currency for many years.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They used to use tulips.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
They used to use tulips, and the tulip flower is kind of like a, it's like a champagne glass.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's tall, and it's kind of empty in the middle.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, that's interesting.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So next time somebody says, do you think money grows on trees, in Holland it literally did.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, yeah.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Almost.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
All right.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What about a carnation?

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
OK, a carnation is another pretty flower, and they come, I think, in red, pink, and white.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, I've mostly seen white carnations.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, and you know, flower giving, there's a whole method to it, right?

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So yeah, every flower is symbolic of something.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Red roses are for love, and carnations, I think, are generally for either friendship or like when someone dies, I'm not sure.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can give them to somebody.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When someone has passed away.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Really?

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not sure I have to look it up, but carnation is another very, very common flower that you'll see in many different colors.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
OK, and the next flower is also really common.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's a lily.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
All right, a lily is a beautiful flower, and usually you see these on water, so water lilies for example is another name you might hear.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
OK, a water lily or just a regular lily, and next we have the most common of all the flowers, but we've added a little twist to it.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's a long stem rose.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Right, so rose everyone knows.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Shakespeare wrote a lot about roses, but in this case, we're talking about long stem roses, and we talked about this with sunflowers.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The stem is the green part that grows out of the ground, and you think of the flower as the head, and so the stem is actually the connector between the ground and the flower.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
OK, so these types of roses have a really long stem, so they're very nice to like maybe give one of them away or something.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, that's right, and you see, for example, at the opera you see singers, people throw these roses at them and they pick them up and they're so long, the stems are so long and they collect them in their arms, and so that's a long stem rose.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All right, interesting.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
OK, why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time, let's keep a look out for these flower names and their pronunciation, and we'll come back in a little bit.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hello sir, how may I help you?

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I would like to buy some flowers please, something really nice.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I see, may I ask what the occasion is?

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's not really an occasion, it's more like I'm sorry.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Very well, this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think I'm going to need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What else do you recommend?

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hmm, well this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't think that's going to cut it.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I need something bigger and better.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry sir, but what exactly did you do?

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Get out of my store you jerk!

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Alright, we're back.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So in this dialogue, we had a lot of interesting phrases.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So let's look at them now in Fluency Builder.

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
A lot of these phrases, Marco, have to do with, well, what the guy did wrong in today's dialogue.

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And so the first one is to cheat on.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So the woman offered him the I'm sorry I cheated on you package, right?

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So it's like an arrangement of flowers that usually people buy when they cheated on their boyfriend or girlfriend.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And so in this case, to cheat on means to see another person.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So if you're married to a woman, seeing someone else, you know, having a date or a romantic encounter with another person is cheating on your wife.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So you're cheating on your wife.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And you use it like this, cheat on, right?

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Cheat on.

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So he cheated on her.

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Or they were both cheating on each other.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay, so to cheat on.

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Not a good thing.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Not a good thing.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
All right.

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So he was explaining to her that wasn't enough.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The arrangement wasn't enough.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And he said, I don't think that's going to cut it.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, okay, you've probably heard the word cut before.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But in this case, Marco, we're talking about to be able to cut something, cut it.

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So that's not going to cut it or it's not going to cut it.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's not going to be enough.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Exactly.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So that's not quite what I'm looking for.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's not enough.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He wants bigger and better.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He wants more.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And so, for example, we could say, you know what?

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This dessert's not going to cut it.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We need something much fancier.

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So to be good enough for.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So to be good enough for.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,000
All right.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Very good.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And then he was explaining to the shop lady what happened and he said, well, I accidentally insinuated.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
To insinuate is to suggest.

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So I could say, hey, you're really chubby.

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's not an insinuation.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's a statement.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But I could say, well, you're looking a little bit round in the sides.

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's an insinuation because I'm suggesting without saying something.

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So you're saying something indirectly, right?

159
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And he was insinuating that his girlfriend was getting chubbier.

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Chubby.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So chubby, chubbier, chubbiest.

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
In this case, we're talking about being round or a little bit overweight.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Right.

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So it's not really saying fat.

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No.

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Fat is rude.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Right.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Chubby is, you know, it's in between.

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Just a little bit extra pounds.

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Like maybe you had a little bit too much ice cream over the past couple months.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
All right.

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Very good.

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back.

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Hello, sir.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How may I help you?

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I would like to buy some flowers, please.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Something really nice.

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I see.

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
May I ask what the occasion is?

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's not really an occasion.

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's more like I'm sorry.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Very well.

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends.

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out.

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I think I'm going to need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear.

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What else do you recommend?

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Well, this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package.

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies.

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't think that's going to cut it.

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I need something bigger and better.

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry, sir.

195
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But what exactly did you do?

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Get out of my store, you jerk.

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
All right.

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So if you make a mistake, like as a guy, right, you give flowers to your girlfriend.

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What about women giving flowers to guys?

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Is that common?

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you think that's possible?

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Can you do that?

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sure you can do it, but I don't know if it's as common.

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Like I think as a guy, I wouldn't really feel comfortable receiving flowers.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Really?

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I mean, I would be touched by the gesture and I would be like, oh, that's really sweet.

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But like flowers, it's a little bit too feminine, I think.

209
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Generally, I think it's a one sided thing.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So you can get flowers for your mother or you can get flowers for a friend or if someone, you know, passed away, you can get flowers for their family.

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But in a romantic situation, rarely do you get flowers to a guy.

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So if you want to say I'm sorry to a guy, what do you give him?

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Season tickets to his favorite football.

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That works.

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Or a game for his PlayStation or offer him a new coat of paint on his car.

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't know.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Have you never given a gift to somebody like saying I'm sorry?

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No, no.

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You don't make mistakes.

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I like to use my words.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Ah, that's good.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

223
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is kind of interesting.

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Why do we do this, though?

225
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Why do we give gifts to people as a token or as a demonstration of our regretfulness?

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Well, can I get personal for a second?

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I just was thinking about this in terms of engagement.

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So why do people give a ring when they get engaged?

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So I think it's because people like things that glitter, you know, it's like distract the woman and she'll say yes.

230
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And so it's the similar thing with flowers and forgiveness.

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You say, oh gosh, these flowers are so beautiful.

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Of course I forgive you.

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh, they're so pretty and they smell so, you know, it's like distraction from the matter at hand.

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Right.

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Maybe that's it.

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't know.

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If you disagree with me, please.

238
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It was a very wise man who invented this.

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Absolutely.

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000
All right.

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000

Bye.

244

Bye.
