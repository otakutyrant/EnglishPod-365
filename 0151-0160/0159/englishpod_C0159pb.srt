00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,599
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,160
And my name is Katherine, welcome back everyone.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,060
So what are we talking about today, Marco?

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:13,039
We are going to the flower shop.

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:20,940
Okay, so this is an intermediate level lesson, and we're going to be learning about the different kinds of flowers you can buy at a flower shop.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,719
And so we've got a guy here who's probably trying to say something to someone he loves.

7
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,120
Yeah, I think he did something to his girlfriend or wife.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,380
And well, that's the typical thing, right?

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,399
You do something wrong, so you got to get her flowers.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:42,399
And that's why women are often very nervous when their husband or boyfriend gives them flowers because she's thinking, what did he do wrong?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,439
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue and we'll be back soon.

12
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:55,960
Hello, sir.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,159
How may I help you?

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,200
I would like to buy some flowers, please.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,479
Something really nice.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,420
I see.

17
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,079
May I ask what the occasion is?

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,599
It's not really an occasion.

19
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,019
It's more like I'm sorry.

20
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:07,099
Very well.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,620
This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends.

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,700
It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out.

23
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,019
It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

24
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,760
I think I'm going to need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear.

25
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,099
What else do you recommend?

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,079
Well, this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,599
Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies.

28
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,459
The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,680
I don't think that's going to cut it.

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,120
I need something bigger and better.

31
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:44,439
I'm sorry, sir, but what exactly did you do?

32
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,680
Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

33
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,079
Get out of my store, you jerk.

34
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,299
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,200
So what do you think?

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,700
Is this really like a bad thing to do?

37
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:00,700
Heck yeah.

38
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,599
No, really?

39
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,120
Well, no one wants to hear that someone thinks they're fat.

40
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,199
OK, and chubby is maybe not as bad as fat, but the guy could have been a little bit nicer.

41
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,800
All right, so we'll give our listeners some advice towards the end of the lesson.

42
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,219
So now why don't we take a look at all the flower names in language takeaway?

43
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,419
OK, this first flower is a beautiful one, and it has delicious seeds that people like to eat.

44
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:29,919
It's called a sunflower.

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,379
A sunflower.

46
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,680
All right, so that's a yellow flower, right?

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,000
It's bright yellow, and in the middle is orange, and the stems are very, very long.

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,580
And thick.

49
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,379
Yeah, and thick.

50
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,580
So it's a tall flower.

51
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,840
OK, sunflower.

52
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,620
And yeah, as you mentioned, some people eat sunflower seeds.

53
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,520
They're like the little salty ones, right?

54
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,360
That's right, they're really good.

55
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,300
All right, next is an orchid.

56
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:58,379
OK, an orchid is a beautiful flower, and they're often grown just one at a time, and people collect orchids, so these can be very, very expensive.

57
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,199
They're very expensive.

58
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,340
And they come in all shapes, sizes, and colors.

59
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,400
OK, an orchid.

60
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,780
Now what about a tulip?

61
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:13,560
A tulip is another pretty flower, and I think they're most famous in Holland for their tulips, because this actually used to be the kind of money that they would use.

62
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,139
This was their currency for many years.

63
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:16,180
They used to use tulips.

64
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,659
They used to use tulips, and the tulip flower is kind of like a, it's like a champagne glass.

65
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,240
It's tall, and it's kind of empty in the middle.

66
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,159
Oh, that's interesting.

67
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,780
So next time somebody says, do you think money grows on trees, in Holland it literally did.

68
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,620
Well, yeah.

69
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,439
Almost.

70
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:33,639
All right.

71
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,199
What about a carnation?

72
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,199
OK, a carnation is another pretty flower, and they come, I think, in red, pink, and white.

73
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,580
Yeah, I've mostly seen white carnations.

74
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,620
Yeah, and you know, flower giving, there's a whole method to it, right?

75
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,919
So yeah, every flower is symbolic of something.

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:59,280
Red roses are for love, and carnations, I think, are generally for either friendship or like when someone dies, I'm not sure.

77
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,439
You can give them to somebody.

78
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,099
When someone has passed away.

79
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,419
Really?

80
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,060
I'm not sure I have to look it up, but carnation is another very, very common flower that you'll see in many different colors.

81
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,819
OK, and the next flower is also really common.

82
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:11,439
It's a lily.

83
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,959
All right, a lily is a beautiful flower, and usually you see these on water, so water lilies for example is another name you might hear.

84
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:27,560
OK, a water lily or just a regular lily, and next we have the most common of all the flowers, but we've added a little twist to it.

85
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,139
It's a long stem rose.

86
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,000
Right, so rose everyone knows.

87
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,199
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

88
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,899
Shakespeare wrote a lot about roses, but in this case, we're talking about long stem roses, and we talked about this with sunflowers.

89
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:50,319
The stem is the green part that grows out of the ground, and you think of the flower as the head, and so the stem is actually the connector between the ground and the flower.

90
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,680
OK, so these types of roses have a really long stem, so they're very nice to like maybe give one of them away or something.

91
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:08,420
Yeah, that's right, and you see, for example, at the opera you see singers, people throw these roses at them and they pick them up and they're so long, the stems are so long and they collect them in their arms, and so that's a long stem rose.

92
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:09,519
All right, interesting.

93
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:18,439
OK, why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time, let's keep a look out for these flower names and their pronunciation, and we'll come back in a little bit.

94
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,779
Hello sir, how may I help you?

95
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:28,180
I would like to buy some flowers please, something really nice.

96
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,740
I see, may I ask what the occasion is?

97
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,660
It's not really an occasion, it's more like I'm sorry.

98
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,079
Very well, this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends.

99
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,100
It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out.

100
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,639
It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

101
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,399
I think I'm going to need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear.

102
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:52,759
What else do you recommend?

103
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,699
Hmm, well this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package.

104
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,220
Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies.

105
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,100
The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

106
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,300
I don't think that's going to cut it.

107
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,720
I need something bigger and better.

108
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,060
I'm sorry sir, but what exactly did you do?

109
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,279
Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

110
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,660
Get out of my store you jerk!

111
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,500
Alright, we're back.

112
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,240
So in this dialogue, we had a lot of interesting phrases.

113
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,360
So let's look at them now in Fluency Builder.

114
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:38,139
A lot of these phrases, Marco, have to do with, well, what the guy did wrong in today's dialogue.

115
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,740
And so the first one is to cheat on.

116
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,300
So the woman offered him the I'm sorry I cheated on you package, right?

117
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,019
So it's like an arrangement of flowers that usually people buy when they cheated on their boyfriend or girlfriend.

118
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:55,579
And so in this case, to cheat on means to see another person.

119
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:06,779
So if you're married to a woman, seeing someone else, you know, having a date or a romantic encounter with another person is cheating on your wife.

120
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,360
So you're cheating on your wife.

121
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,319
And you use it like this, cheat on, right?

122
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,019
Cheat on.

123
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,560
So he cheated on her.

124
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:15,279
Or they were both cheating on each other.

125
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:17,420
Okay, so to cheat on.

126
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,180
Not a good thing.

127
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:19,160
Not a good thing.

128
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,680
All right.

129
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,839
So he was explaining to her that wasn't enough.

130
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,939
The arrangement wasn't enough.

131
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,560
And he said, I don't think that's going to cut it.

132
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:29,560
Well, okay, you've probably heard the word cut before.

133
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,300
But in this case, Marco, we're talking about to be able to cut something, cut it.

134
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:37,060
So that's not going to cut it or it's not going to cut it.

135
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,100
It's not going to be enough.

136
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:38,959
Exactly.

137
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,980
So that's not quite what I'm looking for.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,699
It's not enough.

139
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,000
He wants bigger and better.

140
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,620
He wants more.

141
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,319
And so, for example, we could say, you know what?

142
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,420
This dessert's not going to cut it.

143
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,939
We need something much fancier.

144
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:50,779
Okay.

145
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,620
So to be good enough for.

146
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,060
Okay.

147
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,379
So to be good enough for.

148
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:54,899
All right.

149
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:55,519
Very good.

150
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,699
And then he was explaining to the shop lady what happened and he said, well, I accidentally insinuated.

151
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,899
Okay.

152
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:06,180
To insinuate is to suggest.

153
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,860
So I could say, hey, you're really chubby.

154
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,579
That's not an insinuation.

155
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,480
That's a statement.

156
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,680
But I could say, well, you're looking a little bit round in the sides.

157
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,879
That's an insinuation because I'm suggesting without saying something.

158
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,720
So you're saying something indirectly, right?

159
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,019
And he was insinuating that his girlfriend was getting chubbier.

160
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:26,540
Chubby.

161
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,019
So chubby, chubbier, chubbiest.

162
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:33,159
In this case, we're talking about being round or a little bit overweight.

163
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:33,679
Right.

164
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,000
So it's not really saying fat.

165
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,539
No.

166
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,799
Fat is rude.

167
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,279
Right.

168
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,279
Chubby is, you know, it's in between.

169
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,559
Just a little bit extra pounds.

170
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,019
Yeah.

171
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,039
Like maybe you had a little bit too much ice cream over the past couple months.

172
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,840
All right.

173
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:46,759
Very good.

174
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,379
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back.

175
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,919
Hello, sir.

176
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,100
How may I help you?

177
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,120
I would like to buy some flowers, please.

178
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,419
Something really nice.

179
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,360
I see.

180
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,039
May I ask what the occasion is?

181
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,559
It's not really an occasion.

182
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,980
It's more like I'm sorry.

183
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,019
Very well.

184
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,320
This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends.

185
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,460
It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out.

186
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:25,960
It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

187
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,700
I think I'm going to need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear.

188
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,039
What else do you recommend?

189
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,019
Well, this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package.

190
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,559
Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies.

191
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,440
The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

192
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,639
I don't think that's going to cut it.

193
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,059
I need something bigger and better.

194
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:48,360
I'm sorry, sir.

195
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,360
But what exactly did you do?

196
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,659
Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

197
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,019
Get out of my store, you jerk.

198
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,379
All right.

199
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:07,279
So if you make a mistake, like as a guy, right, you give flowers to your girlfriend.

200
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,700
What about women giving flowers to guys?

201
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,559
Is that common?

202
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,559
Do you think that's possible?

203
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,419
Can you do that?

204
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,419
I'm sure you can do it, but I don't know if it's as common.

205
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,379
Like I think as a guy, I wouldn't really feel comfortable receiving flowers.

206
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:21,759
Really?

207
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,379
I mean, I would be touched by the gesture and I would be like, oh, that's really sweet.

208
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,500
But like flowers, it's a little bit too feminine, I think.

209
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,360
Generally, I think it's a one sided thing.

210
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:39,200
So you can get flowers for your mother or you can get flowers for a friend or if someone, you know, passed away, you can get flowers for their family.

211
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,080
But in a romantic situation, rarely do you get flowers to a guy.

212
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,259
So if you want to say I'm sorry to a guy, what do you give him?

213
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,019
Season tickets to his favorite football.

214
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,419
That works.

215
00:10:52,020 --> 00:11:01,879
Or a game for his PlayStation or offer him a new coat of paint on his car.

216
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:03,740
I don't know.

217
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,519
Have you never given a gift to somebody like saying I'm sorry?

218
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,860
No, no.

219
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:08,659
You don't make mistakes.

220
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,159
I like to use my words.

221
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,240
Ah, that's good.

222
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:11,740
Yeah.

223
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,720
This is kind of interesting.

224
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,799
Why do we do this, though?

225
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,240
Why do we give gifts to people as a token or as a demonstration of our regretfulness?

226
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,419
Well, can I get personal for a second?

227
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,440
I just was thinking about this in terms of engagement.

228
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,659
So why do people give a ring when they get engaged?

229
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:34,419
So I think it's because people like things that glitter, you know, it's like distract the woman and she'll say yes.

230
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,220
And so it's the similar thing with flowers and forgiveness.

231
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,139
You say, oh gosh, these flowers are so beautiful.

232
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:42,360
Of course I forgive you.

233
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,759
Oh, they're so pretty and they smell so, you know, it's like distraction from the matter at hand.

234
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:48,179
Right.

235
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,179
Maybe that's it.

236
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:49,580
I don't know.

237
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,860
If you disagree with me, please.

238
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,440
It was a very wise man who invented this.

239
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,159
Absolutely.

240
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:54,679
All right.

241
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,340

244

Bye.
