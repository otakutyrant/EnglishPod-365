00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:10,279
EnglishPod.com Hey honey, how was your day?

2
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,599
It was alright.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,060
I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,380
He's in a bit of a jam.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:15,980
Why?

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,679
What happened?

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,980
Well, his son had an accident.

8
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,539
Bill doesn't have health insurance.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,839
This really got me thinking, and I wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different HMOs.

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, you're right.

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,879
We aren't getting any younger and our kids are getting older.

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:30,859
Exactly.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,759
I searched on the web and found a couple of HMOs with low co-pays and good coverage.

14
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,479
The deductibles are low too.

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,380
Sounds good.

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,100
Although, do you think we can qualify for insurance?

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,439
Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,600
Well, we don't have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.

19
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,840
I wish our company or country provided us with health care.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,280
Not in a million years.
