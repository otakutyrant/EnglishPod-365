00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
EnglishPod.com Hey honey, how was your day?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It was alright.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He's in a bit of a jam.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Why?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What happened?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, his son had an accident.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Bill doesn't have health insurance.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This really got me thinking, and I wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different HMOs.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, you're right.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We aren't getting any younger and our kids are getting older.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Exactly.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I searched on the web and found a couple of HMOs with low co-pays and good coverage.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The deductibles are low too.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Sounds good.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Although, do you think we can qualify for insurance?

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, we don't have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I wish our company or country provided us with health care.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Not in a million years.
