00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And my name is Katherine.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So today we've got a great upper intermediate level lesson for our learners and we're talking about what?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Healthcare.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, this is a very important topic because it's been in the news recently, especially in the context of American politics.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And so I don't know if you've heard things about this, listeners, but healthcare is a very hot topic.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Exactly.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So basically what we're talking about is health insurance, whether it's private health insurance or, you know, like a standard national insurance program.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Exactly.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And so your country might have a private option where you can pay a private company for insurance or public option like England or Australia, where your country will actually provide health care for you at no extra cost.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Very good.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So it's an interesting topic.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Why don't we jump directly into the dialog and we'll be back to explain a couple of things.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hey, honey, how was your day?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It was all right.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He's in a bit of a jam.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why?

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What happened?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, his son had an accident.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Bill doesn't have health insurance.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This really got me thinking.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different HMOs.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, you're right.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We aren't getting any younger and our kids are getting older.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Exactly.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I searched on the Web and found a couple of HMOs with low co-pays and good coverage.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The deductibles are low, too.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Sounds good.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Although, do you think we can qualify for insurance?

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, we don't have any preexisting illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I wish our company or country provided us with health care.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Not in a million years.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
All right, we're back.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So a lot of interesting vocab here.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why don't we take a look at it real fast in language takeaway?

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Language takeaway.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
OK, Marco, this first phrase or acronym actually is three words that go together HMO.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And they're very, very common when you're talking about health care.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Right.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So an HMO means health maintenance organization.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
OK.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And so this is this is a part of the health insurance topic.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We're talking about a company that will provide health insurance.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Right.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So it's a company that provides health insurance, basically.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And if you go up to an HMO, some of the information that you'll receive is, for example, what your copay will be.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
OK, so sometimes with a private option, when you pay a company to give you health insurance, you can get a lower rate if you help pay for some of your care.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, for example, a copay on a broken arm might be twenty dollars, but you pay twenty dollars.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's your copay.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And your health insurance company pays the rest.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And so sometimes copays are really high, but they're really big.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And that's kind of a bad deal, because if if you hurt yourself, you don't want to pay a lot.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Right.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But sometimes there's no copay, in which case your company will pay for all of the coverage.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All right.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So another very similar word is a deductible.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
OK, so deductible is something that is fixed and it's in your insurance policy.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That means in the contract that you make with the insurance company, the deductible will be stated.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
For example, my insurance plan, I have maybe a five hundred dollar deductible.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That means that in any situation I get hurt or I get sick, I pay for the first five hundred dollars of care and then my insurance company pays for the rest.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Right.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So if I have to have a thousand dollar surgery, I pay five hundred dollars and then my insurance company pays the other five hundred dollars.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
OK, very good.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And, well, you have these deductibles and everything, and that depends on your coverage, right?

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So coverage, how much the HMO covers you.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And so you can find this also in your contract with your insurance company and coverage will include or not include something.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So coverage, for example, in a health care plan does not usually include your teeth.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's a separate kind of insurance.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But a coverage can include emergency evacuation from from from a situation or ambulances, for example.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And so coverage is what is included in your insurance plan.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
OK, very good.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And our last word for today is to qualify for.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
All right.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So you might have heard this phrase before in the context of sports or academics.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So he qualified for a scholarship or she qualified for the varsity volleyball team.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But in this case, to qualify for is to be to be able to use so eligible to be eligible for.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So sometimes HMOs like in, for example, the United States will not accept a person who has maybe some health problems already because that would be too much of a risk.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Right.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
For the company.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
All right.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's right.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Or you could qualify for a reduced rate because you have a very good health history.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
OK, so this is very interesting.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And we have a couple of other phrases that are very related to this language.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder?

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Fluency Builder.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So in Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at our first phrase.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We got to talking for a while.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
OK, we could say, for example, we started talking or we were talking for a while.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But this is a very spoken language kind of phrase where we'd say we got to talking.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Right.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So it's not really grammatically correct, but because you would say we started talking.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But sometimes people say we got to talking.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So we got into a conversation.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Right.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's right.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And usually it's about something.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So we could say, yeah, we got to talking about how we both went to the same high school or we got to talking about this movie that we both saw.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
OK, very good.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And well, they got to talking for a while and apparently his friend was in a bit of a jam.

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
OK, jam is a food.

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You can eat it.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You put it on bread like marmalade.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Right.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Exactly.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But in this case, a jam is a fix or a difficult situation.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So it has a very different meaning.

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I want to warn you about that first.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But to be in a jam or to be in a bit of a jam is to be stuck.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
OK, so you're in a difficult situation.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You have some problem.

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So, Marco, I'm in a bit of a jam here.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Can I get your help with something?

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
All right.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Very good.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
OK.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And then the guy was talking about insurance and he said this really got me thinking.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So we got the verb God again there.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
All right.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So it got me thinking.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That means I started thinking about something.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So, you know, when we were talking about jam a minute ago, it got me thinking about how much I love breakfast.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Very good.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So you would use it in that way, right?

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Like it reminded me.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It reminded me or I started to really think about something.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
OK.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And our last phrase is a pre-existing illness.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
All right.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So to exist is to be, you know, to to be around pre-existing means existing before something else.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
OK.

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And so you often hear this in terms of insurance when someone asks you about your pre-existing condition.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So that means if I'm signing up for an insurance plan, a health insurance plan, and I have an interview with you, Marco, and you ask me this question.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What is your pre-existing condition?

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That means what diseases or health problems do I have right now?

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Right.

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Prior to signing up for this insurance.

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And I say, oh, I don't have any.

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And you're very happy because that means I'll be cheap.

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But if I say, oh, I have diabetes, then that is something that the insurance companies don't like because it's expensive.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Right.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Because you're more probable of getting sick or something like that.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Right.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So diabetes or cancer or Lyme disease.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
These are all pre-existing conditions and usually pre-existing conditions are diseases or problems, health problems that you have that won't go away.

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
OK, very good.

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
All right.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So we have a lot of words, a lot of phrases here.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back.

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hey, honey, how was your day?

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It was all right.

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He's in a bit of a jam.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why?

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What happened?

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, his son had an accident.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Bill doesn't have health insurance.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This really got me thinking.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different HMOs.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, you're right.

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We aren't getting any younger and our kids are getting older.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Exactly.

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I searched on the Web and found a couple of HMOs with low co-pays and good coverage.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The deductibles are low, too.

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Sounds good.

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Although, do you think we can qualify for insurance?

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, we don't have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I wish our company or country provided us with health care.

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Not in a million years.

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
All right.

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So the health care issue is pretty heated debate now in the United States because many people don't have health care and it's not very accessible, right?

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And it's a huge debate because it's very, very divided by party lines.

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We say, you know, there's the Republicans on the right and there's the Democrats on the left and the Democrats want a public health care option.

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
They want health care to be available for everyone for free.

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Right.

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And many of them do.

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And a lot of Republicans say, no, it should be private because if it's private, there's competition.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And that means there's better health care.

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And so there's a really big debate.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
People are getting very angry about it.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, but I think it's something that's very interesting.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And most importantly, seeing the difference of health care systems around the world.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Right.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So, for example, our listeners there are from everywhere in the world.

195
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So we would like to know what the health care system is like there.

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you have free universal health care in your country or do you also have to pay for private companies or private health insurance?

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And if you have one or the other system, do you think it's a good thing?

198
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Do you think it's a bad thing?

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What do you think needs some work?

200
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Right.

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I definitely agree with universal health care.

202
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I think it's a relief because it's like one thing less to worry about.

203
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't imagine, like, you know, if I don't have health care right now and I'm not covered by a private company and something happens to me tomorrow, then, you know, what's going to happen?

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I think it's a basic human right personally.

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So I think it's in the best interests of a country to invest in it because it means that their people are more productive and happier and healthy.

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah.

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
All right.

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So that's all the time we have for today.
