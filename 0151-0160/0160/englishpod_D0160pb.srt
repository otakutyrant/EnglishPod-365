00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:04,900
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,559
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,120
And my name is Katherine.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,279
So today we've got a great upper intermediate level lesson for our learners and we're talking about what?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,060
Healthcare.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,600
Okay, this is a very important topic because it's been in the news recently, especially in the context of American politics.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,199
And so I don't know if you've heard things about this, listeners, but healthcare is a very hot topic.

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:24,940
Exactly.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,079
So basically what we're talking about is health insurance, whether it's private health insurance or, you know, like a standard national insurance program.

11
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:33,840
Exactly.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:46,420
And so your country might have a private option where you can pay a private company for insurance or public option like England or Australia, where your country will actually provide health care for you at no extra cost.

13
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:47,000
Very good.

14
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,640
So it's an interesting topic.

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,640
Why don't we jump directly into the dialog and we'll be back to explain a couple of things.

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,479
Hey, honey, how was your day?

17
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,840
It was all right.

18
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,239
I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,579
He's in a bit of a jam.

20
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:09,159
Why?

21
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:09,859
What happened?

22
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,180
Well, his son had an accident.

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,739
Bill doesn't have health insurance.

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,359
This really got me thinking.

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,019
And I wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different HMOs.

26
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,180
Yeah, you're right.

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,079
We aren't getting any younger and our kids are getting older.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,040
Exactly.

29
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,959
I searched on the Web and found a couple of HMOs with low co-pays and good coverage.

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,739
The deductibles are low, too.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,560
Sounds good.

32
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,299
Although, do you think we can qualify for insurance?

33
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,620
Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,799
Well, we don't have any preexisting illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.

35
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:46,040
I wish our company or country provided us with health care.

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,439
Not in a million years.

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,260
All right, we're back.

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,219
So a lot of interesting vocab here.

39
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,099
Why don't we take a look at it real fast in language takeaway?

40
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:00,959
Language takeaway.

41
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:08,319
OK, Marco, this first phrase or acronym actually is three words that go together HMO.

42
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,620
And they're very, very common when you're talking about health care.

43
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:12,099
Right.

44
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,719
So an HMO means health maintenance organization.

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:16,400
OK.

46
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,860
And so this is this is a part of the health insurance topic.

47
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,580
We're talking about a company that will provide health insurance.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,020
Right.

49
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:26,780
So it's a company that provides health insurance, basically.

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:33,400
And if you go up to an HMO, some of the information that you'll receive is, for example, what your copay will be.

51
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:41,919
OK, so sometimes with a private option, when you pay a company to give you health insurance, you can get a lower rate if you help pay for some of your care.

52
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:49,199
So, for example, a copay on a broken arm might be twenty dollars, but you pay twenty dollars.

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,060
That's your copay.

54
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,520
And your health insurance company pays the rest.

55
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,879
And so sometimes copays are really high, but they're really big.

56
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,580
And that's kind of a bad deal, because if if you hurt yourself, you don't want to pay a lot.

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:00,919
Right.

58
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,259
But sometimes there's no copay, in which case your company will pay for all of the coverage.

59
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,400
All right.

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,639
So another very similar word is a deductible.

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,400
OK, so deductible is something that is fixed and it's in your insurance policy.

62
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,680
That means in the contract that you make with the insurance company, the deductible will be stated.

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,319
For example, my insurance plan, I have maybe a five hundred dollar deductible.

64
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:31,819
That means that in any situation I get hurt or I get sick, I pay for the first five hundred dollars of care and then my insurance company pays for the rest.

65
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:32,099
Right.

66
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:39,060
So if I have to have a thousand dollar surgery, I pay five hundred dollars and then my insurance company pays the other five hundred dollars.

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
OK, very good.

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,139
And, well, you have these deductibles and everything, and that depends on your coverage, right?

69
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,360
So coverage, how much the HMO covers you.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,300
That's right.

71
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:59,099
And so you can find this also in your contract with your insurance company and coverage will include or not include something.

72
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,840
So coverage, for example, in a health care plan does not usually include your teeth.

73
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,780
That's a separate kind of insurance.

74
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,199
Right.

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:15,060
But a coverage can include emergency evacuation from from from a situation or ambulances, for example.

76
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,420
And so coverage is what is included in your insurance plan.

77
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,639
OK, very good.

78
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,920
And our last word for today is to qualify for.

79
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:25,759
All right.

80
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,279
So you might have heard this phrase before in the context of sports or academics.

81
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:37,620
So he qualified for a scholarship or she qualified for the varsity volleyball team.

82
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:44,759
But in this case, to qualify for is to be to be able to use so eligible to be eligible for.

83
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:55,519
So sometimes HMOs like in, for example, the United States will not accept a person who has maybe some health problems already because that would be too much of a risk.

84
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:55,800
Right.

85
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:56,480
For the company.

86
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:57,259
All right.

87
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,639
That's right.

88
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:02,660
Or you could qualify for a reduced rate because you have a very good health history.

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,300
OK, so this is very interesting.

90
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,379
And we have a couple of other phrases that are very related to this language.

91
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,339
So why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder?

92
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:15,399
Fluency Builder.

93
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,139
All right.

94
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,139
So in Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at our first phrase.

95
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,480
We got to talking for a while.

96
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:27,879
OK, we could say, for example, we started talking or we were talking for a while.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,319
But this is a very spoken language kind of phrase where we'd say we got to talking.

98
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:33,839
Right.

99
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:38,980
So it's not really grammatically correct, but because you would say we started talking.

100
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,519
But sometimes people say we got to talking.

101
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,319
So we got into a conversation.

102
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:43,680
Right.

103
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,220
That's right.

104
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:45,600
And usually it's about something.

105
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:53,459
So we could say, yeah, we got to talking about how we both went to the same high school or we got to talking about this movie that we both saw.

106
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,019
OK, very good.

107
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:02,000
And well, they got to talking for a while and apparently his friend was in a bit of a jam.

108
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,959
OK, jam is a food.

109
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,660
You can eat it.

110
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,259
You put it on bread like marmalade.

111
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:06,480
Right.

112
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,160
Exactly.

113
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,720
But in this case, a jam is a fix or a difficult situation.

114
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,579
So it has a very different meaning.

115
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,199
And I want to warn you about that first.

116
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,500
But to be in a jam or to be in a bit of a jam is to be stuck.

117
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,160
OK, so you're in a difficult situation.

118
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,100
You have some problem.

119
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:23,879
Yeah.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,420
So, Marco, I'm in a bit of a jam here.

121
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,560
Can I get your help with something?

122
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:27,980
All right.

123
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,740
Very good.

124
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:29,840
OK.

125
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,899
And then the guy was talking about insurance and he said this really got me thinking.

126
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,800
So we got the verb God again there.

127
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:38,480
All right.

128
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,620
So it got me thinking.

129
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,240
That means I started thinking about something.

130
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:48,439
So, you know, when we were talking about jam a minute ago, it got me thinking about how much I love breakfast.

131
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,980
Very good.

132
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,600
So you would use it in that way, right?

133
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,439
Like it reminded me.

134
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,120
It reminded me or I started to really think about something.

135
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:57,980
OK.

136
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,060
And our last phrase is a pre-existing illness.

137
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,160
All right.

138
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:10,720
So to exist is to be, you know, to to be around pre-existing means existing before something else.

139
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,160
OK.

140
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:16,660
And so you often hear this in terms of insurance when someone asks you about your pre-existing condition.

141
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:24,060
So that means if I'm signing up for an insurance plan, a health insurance plan, and I have an interview with you, Marco, and you ask me this question.

142
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,759
What is your pre-existing condition?

143
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,180
That means what diseases or health problems do I have right now?

144
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:32,579
Right.

145
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,899
Prior to signing up for this insurance.

146
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,500
And I say, oh, I don't have any.

147
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,560
And you're very happy because that means I'll be cheap.

148
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:47,399
But if I say, oh, I have diabetes, then that is something that the insurance companies don't like because it's expensive.

149
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:47,899
Right.

150
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,579
Because you're more probable of getting sick or something like that.

151
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:51,959
Right.

152
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,959
So diabetes or cancer or Lyme disease.

153
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:04,519
These are all pre-existing conditions and usually pre-existing conditions are diseases or problems, health problems that you have that won't go away.

154
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,759
OK, very good.

155
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:06,720
All right.

156
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,339
So we have a lot of words, a lot of phrases here.

157
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back.

158
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,879
Hey, honey, how was your day?

159
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,259
It was all right.

160
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,660
I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.

161
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,980
He's in a bit of a jam.

162
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:28,579
Why?

163
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,240
What happened?

164
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,560
Well, his son had an accident.

165
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,100
Bill doesn't have health insurance.

166
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,759
This really got me thinking.

167
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,399
And I wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different HMOs.

168
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,600
Yeah, you're right.

169
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,460
We aren't getting any younger and our kids are getting older.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,440
Exactly.

171
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:48,320
I searched on the Web and found a couple of HMOs with low co-pays and good coverage.

172
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,100
The deductibles are low, too.

173
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,940
Sounds good.

174
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,759
Although, do you think we can qualify for insurance?

175
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,039
Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.

176
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,240
Well, we don't have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.

177
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,460
I wish our company or country provided us with health care.

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,940
Not in a million years.

179
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,179
All right.

180
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:21,519
So the health care issue is pretty heated debate now in the United States because many people don't have health care and it's not very accessible, right?

181
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,340
That's right.

182
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:28,120
And it's a huge debate because it's very, very divided by party lines.

183
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,620
We say, you know, there's the Republicans on the right and there's the Democrats on the left and the Democrats want a public health care option.

184
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,440
They want health care to be available for everyone for free.

185
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:39,980
Right.

186
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,019
And many of them do.

187
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:46,039
And a lot of Republicans say, no, it should be private because if it's private, there's competition.

188
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,899
And that means there's better health care.

189
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,720
And so there's a really big debate.

190
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,399
People are getting very angry about it.

191
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,899
Yeah, but I think it's something that's very interesting.

192
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:58,740
And most importantly, seeing the difference of health care systems around the world.

193
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,019
Right.

194
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,919
So, for example, our listeners there are from everywhere in the world.

195
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,000
So we would like to know what the health care system is like there.

196
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,620
Do you have free universal health care in your country or do you also have to pay for private companies or private health insurance?

197
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,860
And if you have one or the other system, do you think it's a good thing?

198
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:17,919
Do you think it's a bad thing?

199
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,159
What do you think needs some work?

200
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:19,659
Right.

201
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,840
I definitely agree with universal health care.

202
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,019
I think it's a relief because it's like one thing less to worry about.

203
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:33,200
I can't imagine, like, you know, if I don't have health care right now and I'm not covered by a private company and something happens to me tomorrow, then, you know, what's going to happen?

204
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,080
I think it's a basic human right personally.

205
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:42,419
So I think it's in the best interests of a country to invest in it because it means that their people are more productive and happier and healthy.

206
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:42,899
Yeah.

207
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,580
All right.

208
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,039
So that's all the time we have for today.
