00:00:01,759 --> 00:00:08,580
EnglishPod.com Tom, how are you?

2
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:10,439
Hey, we missed you at the party last night.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,039
Are you okay?

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,560
I don't know.

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,759
I didn't really feel like going out.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,059
I guess I'm feeling a little homesick.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:17,940
Come on.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,579
We've been through this already.

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,300
Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agree that you were going to try and deal with it.

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,539
I was.

11
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:32,159
It's just that the holidays are coming up, and I won't be able to go home because I can't afford the airfare.

12
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:38,219
I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom's cooking and being around my family.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,619
Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,700
When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,600
I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy, and before I knew it, I was used to it.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,240
I see what you mean, but I'm still bummed out.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,359
Okay, how does this sound?

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,399
Let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,560
I hear that an awesome DJ is playing, and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there.

20
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,219
You know, I could really go for that.

21
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,060
You don't mind being my wingman for tonight.

22
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,239
Not at all.

23
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,439
It'll be fun.

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,540
It will be like a boy's night out.

25
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,120
Well, kind of.

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,760
Great!

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,659
I must warn you though, whatever happens, don't let me go on a drinking binge.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,840
Trust me, it's not a pretty picture.
