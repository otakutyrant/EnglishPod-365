00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com Tom, how are you?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey, we missed you at the party last night.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Are you okay?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I don't know.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I didn't really feel like going out.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I guess I'm feeling a little homesick.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Come on.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We've been through this already.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agree that you were going to try and deal with it.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I was.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's just that the holidays are coming up, and I won't be able to go home because I can't afford the airfare.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom's cooking and being around my family.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy, and before I knew it, I was used to it.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I see what you mean, but I'm still bummed out.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, how does this sound?

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I hear that an awesome DJ is playing, and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You know, I could really go for that.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You don't mind being my wingman for tonight.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Not at all.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It'll be fun.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It will be like a boy's night out.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, kind of.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Great!

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I must warn you though, whatever happens, don't let me go on a drinking binge.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Trust me, it's not a pretty picture.
