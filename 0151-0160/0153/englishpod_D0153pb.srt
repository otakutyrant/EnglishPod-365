00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:05,339
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:07,639
We have an upper intermediate lesson for you today.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,460
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,000
And my name is Catherine.

5
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,460
So today we're talking about something that everyone who's ever lived away from home has felt before.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,800
Right, and that's the word we're going to preview today.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,440
The word is homesick.

8
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,100
All right, so let's take a look at that in today's language preview.

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:23,420
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,600
All right, so homesick.

11
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,399
If you feel homesick, or you are homesick.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,460
Well, yeah, you could say, I'm homesick right now, or are you feeling homesick?

13
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:45,039
So it's a word that means I miss my home, I miss my family, I'm far away, or I haven't seen my family in a long time, and for some reason you just feel sad.

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,859
Okay, so it's a feeling.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,799
You feel a little bit depressed, you feel sad because you're homesick.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,100
Right.

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,039
Okay, so this is what's happening today in our dialogue, so let's listen to it for the first time.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,420
Tom, how are you?

19
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,280
Hey, we missed you at the party last night.

20
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:07,879
Are you okay?

21
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:09,420
I don't know.

22
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,599
I didn't really feel like going out.

23
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,920
I guess I'm feeling a little homesick.

24
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:14,799
Come on.

25
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,420
We've been through this already.

26
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:22,120
Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agree that you were going to try and deal with it.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,480
I was.

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,000
It's just that the holidays are coming up, and I won't be able to go home because I can't afford the airfare.

29
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:35,040
I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom's cooking and being around my family.

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,420
Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays.

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,560
When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home.

32
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:49,400
I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy, and before I knew it, I was used to it.

33
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:53,060
I see what you mean, but I'm still bummed out.

34
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,219
Okay, how does this sound?

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,239
Let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight.

36
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,439
I hear that an awesome DJ is playing, and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there.

37
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,079
You know, I could really go for that.

38
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,900
You don't mind being my wingman for tonight.

39
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,080
Not at all.

40
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,300
It'll be fun.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,400
It will be like a boy's night out.

42
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,960
Well, kind of.

43
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:15,639
Great.

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,500
I must warn you though, whatever happens, don't let me go on a drinking binge.

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,659
Trust me, it's not a pretty picture.

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,240
Alrighty, we're back, so yeah, I guess he's very homesick.

47
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:33,099
Very homesick.

48
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,580
And his friend is really worried.

49
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,099
Yeah.

50
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,680
But actually, I think this is common, right, to be homesick during the holidays, like Christmas for example.

51
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:48,960
Oh man, it's the worst during the holidays, because you think of all the traditions and all the things that you normally do at home, and you're not doing them.

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,539
So this is something we're going to talk more about a little bit later on, but let's take a look at some of the language that was used in Language Takeaway.

53
00:02:58,519 --> 00:02:59,439
Language Takeaway.

54
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,460
This first one is key, right?

55
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:08,060
So when you move away from home, or when you move to a new place, you have a period of adjustment.

56
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:15,460
So adjustment is kind of finding the right balance, or doing something so that you can kind of feel comfortable.

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,580
Okay, so you have to adjust to your new life, life away from home.

58
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,460
Or your new environment.

59
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,340
So many times people say, wow, moving to China must be a big adjustment.

60
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,819
So it means there's so many differences that it must take a long time to feel comfortable again.

61
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:30,520
Okay.

62
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,199
All right, so that's adjustment.

63
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,740
What else do we have?

64
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:38,580
Well, we've got this next phrase that's really important, I think, but often gets overlooked.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,580
We say the comforts of home, right?

66
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:42,479
Comforts of home.

67
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,259
So comfort's pretty easy, right?

68
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,280
Feeling comfortable.

69
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,379
So you have comfort.

70
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:56,819
But the comforts of home are things that are different with every person, but those are things that you have at your home, or your childhood home, or your parents' home that make you feel good and feel happy.

71
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,960
So they're not only physical things or objects, right?

72
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:04,259
They can be like your mom's cooking, or maybe even just spending time with your family.

73
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,240
Right, or reading the newspaper with your dad, or things that you're used to that you don't have anymore.

74
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,120
And so those are the comforts of home.

75
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,080
I could say, Marco, do you miss the comforts of home in Ecuador?

76
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,040
I mean, do you have anything that's really...

77
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,839
Of course, of course.

78
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:27,839
I think one of the main things is actually not living in the city, because I used to live in the valley a little bit further away and kind of almost countryside, so that's one of the comforts of home that I miss.

79
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,759
Oh, you're making me nostalgic, and I've never even been.

80
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,160
All right, well, this is our next word, actually.

81
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:34,480
Nostalgic.

82
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,100
Nostalgic.

83
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,660
It's a feeling.

84
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:38,540
I'm feeling nostalgic, or he's just really nostalgic.

85
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:46,920
And so to be nostalgic is to kind of think about a time before, or think positively about something that you experienced before.

86
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,040
So it's not usually a bad thing.

87
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,000
It's never a bad thing.

88
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,000
Nostalgia is a good, warm, fond memory of something.

89
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,240
Of something from your past.

90
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,139
So you start thinking of something from your past that maybe brings nice, warm feelings.

91
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:04,759
Maybe a little bit sad because you miss those times, but it's usually thinking about the past.

92
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,379
Right, so I have nostalgia for my childhood.

93
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:17,000
I loved summers in Chicago when it was hot, and the kids would play in the sprinkler, and I had my dog, and you know, it's a happy feeling.

94
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,560
Right, so nostalgia would be the noun, and nostalgia would be the adjective.

95
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,139
Exactly.

96
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,740
All right, and our last word for today on Language Takeaway is bummed out.

97
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,000
Bummed out.

98
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,920
I'm bummed out.

99
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,839
We've got another feeling here, so we're all full of feelings today.

100
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,920
Bummed out is a sad feeling.

101
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,439
So to be bummed is kind of slang, and it means to be sad.

102
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,180
Okay, or disappointed.

103
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,360
So you come into the office, Marco, and you look a little tired, and you say, are you okay?

104
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,660
Are you bummed out about something?

105
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,279
I can say, yeah, I lost my wallet last night, so I'm really bummed out.

106
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:51,699
Oh.

107
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:52,800
Or something like that.

108
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,779
So yeah, you feel bummed out when something bad or sad happens to you.

109
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,860
All right, so why don't we move on now to a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

110
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:05,699
Fluency Builder.

111
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,420
All right, this first one is something that you often say to old friends or family.

112
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:19,639
You know, when you're friends with someone, they go through periods of happiness and sadness, and so when someone's going through a down period again, you say, oh, we've been through this already.

113
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,160
We've been through this already.

114
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,740
Or, you know, when you're giving someone advice, and they never take your advice, you say, listen, we've been through this already.

115
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,259
You should know by now that I, and then, you know, whatever the advice is.

116
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:36,399
This has happened before, or we have experienced this before, or we already solved this problem or situation.

117
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:44,680
You could imagine two bank robbers who are going over their plan for the 10th time, and then one says to the other, hey, we've been through this already.

118
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,660
You should know the plan by now.

119
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,139
Exactly.

120
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,740
All right, so we've been through this already.

121
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,759
They were talking about the adjustments and everything, and then what other phrase did they use?

122
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:03,120
Well, the next couple of phrases have to do with the friend's suggestions, because she has a lot of ideas to cheer her friend up, the depressed one.

123
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:06,779
And the first thing she says is, hey, let's hit the dance club.

124
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,199
Okay, let's hit the dance club, or let's hit the dance floor tonight.

125
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,259
All right, so hit in this case doesn't mean like hit.

126
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,720
It doesn't mean you're punching someone.

127
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,139
It means to go to or to do.

128
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,000
All right, so we can say, let's go to the dance club tonight.

129
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,300
Let's hit the dance club.

130
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,759
Exactly.

131
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,560
It doesn't have to be a dance club, but let's hit that concert tonight.

132
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:25,920
Yeah, we really want to go there.

133
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,600
Okay, so you can hit pretty much any place, right?

134
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,220
Exactly.

135
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:37,199
And this is a very kind of spoken language, so you wouldn't say this in your essays, but it's a good way to talk about plans with friends.

136
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:37,740
All right.

137
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,839
And our next word actually is kind of interesting because it's very colloquial, and it's a wingman.

138
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:45,879
I can be your wingman tonight.

139
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:50,500
So wingman, you have to think about wing meaning side, not like a bird's wing.

140
00:07:50,740 --> 00:08:03,319
So a wing means side, and a wingman is a guy who will go with you to a bar or a club to kind of help you find a date or a girl or someone to talk to.

141
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:15,420
Okay, so this person, this wingman, usually keeps you company and helps you decide maybe what girl to talk to or maybe even introduces you to someone at a club or at a restaurant or a bar or whatever.

142
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:18,720
And the key is that people don't like to go alone to bars, right?

143
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,860
Because you feel sad and then you look weird because you're all alone.

144
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,759
And the same is true for girls.

145
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:29,420
And so if a guy wants to go to a bar and he sees two girls, well, he has to have a friend to talk to the other girl.

146
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,699
So wingman also helps in that sense.

147
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,679
He helps balance things.

148
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,080
All right.

149
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,240
So there's a whole science behind the wingman.

150
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,139
I'm sure if you look it up on Wikipedia, you'll find 10 pages of information.

151
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,080
All right.

152
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,120
So since they are going out tonight, they said it could be boys' night out.

153
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:46,840
Okay.

154
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,159
So this is another phrase you hear all the time, especially among young people, boys' night out and girls' night out.

155
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:58,480
And so, you know, sometimes you spend a lot of time with your husband or your wife or your boyfriend or your girlfriend, and you just want to have some time with your friends.

156
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:01,580
And so you call this girls' night for me, girls' night out.

157
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,159
You just go out and you do girl things.

158
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,919
Guys' night out, you do other things.

159
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,960
And so in this case...

160
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,059
So it's girls only or guys only.

161
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,419
Boys' night out is only guys.

162
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,159
Exactly.

163
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,899
And that's why this is funny because it's the girl who says, hey, let's have boys' night out.

164
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,980
And she's not really a boy.

165
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:16,779
All right.

166
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:17,200
Great.

167
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:24,000
And, well, he agreed to go out and everything, but he warned her about him going on a drinking binge.

168
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:24,539
Okay.

169
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,320
Now this is important.

170
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:28,980
A lot of people who are depressed or sad, when they drink, they drink a lot.

171
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,559
And so binge means to do something in excess, to do it too much.

172
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,179
So a drinking binge would be drinking alcohol in excess, too much.

173
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,679
Too much.

174
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,940
So getting drunk right away.

175
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,399
And it's not healthy.

176
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,059
And we do not condone it.

177
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:43,539
Right.

178
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,399
Exactly.

179
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,259
Very good.

180
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,159
So some very interesting phrases in this dialogue today.

181
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,820
I think we should listen to it one more time and we'll be right back.

182
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,399
Tom, how are you?

183
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:03,220
Hey, we missed you at the party last night.

184
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,820
Are you okay?

185
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,379
I don't know.

186
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,539
I didn't really feel like going out.

187
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,840
I guess I'm feeling a little homesick.

188
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:10,740
Come on.

189
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,399
We've been through this already.

190
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,419
Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here.

191
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,080
But we agree that you were going to try and deal with it.

192
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,419
I was.

193
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,940
It's just that the holidays are coming up and I won't be able to go home because I can't afford the airfare.

194
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,980
I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom's cooking and being around my family.

195
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,379
Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays.

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,500
When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home.

197
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,340
I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy, and before I knew it, I was used to it.

198
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,980
I see what you mean, but I'm still bummed out.

199
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,159
Okay, how does this sound?

200
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,179
Let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight.

201
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,399
I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there.

202
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,019
You know, I could really go for that.

203
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,840
You don't mind being my wingman for tonight.

204
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,019
Not at all.

205
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:07,259
It'll be fun.

206
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,340
It will be like a boy's night out.

207
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,960
Well, kind of.

208
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,559
Great.

209
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,440
I must warn you though, whatever happens, don't let me go on a drinking binge.

210
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,740
Trust me, it's not a pretty picture.

211
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,840
Alright, we're back.

212
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:33,220
So speaking of homesick and holidays, do you actually get very depressed or homesick during Christmas?

213
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,500
I do.

214
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:34,519
I do.

215
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Well, my family has a lot of Christmas traditions that are just really kind of wonderful and we do them every single year.

216
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:49,059
And so the first time I spent Christmas away, I was living in Italy and it was kind of similar, but then the second time was when I was living in China.

217
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,200
And China was just not the same, no oven, so no Christmas cookies.

218
00:11:53,759 --> 00:12:00,059
And no granny who pours vodka and eats meatballs and my mom not running around the kitchen.

219
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,799
You feel lonely and then all of a sudden you get a phone call.

220
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:11,879
And it's the entire family and they're all together eating, having an amazing Christmas and they think it's going to help you feel less homesick, but it makes you feel more homesick.

221
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:18,039
So you definitely have nostalgia for those days during the holidays, but what about you?

222
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:26,120
I rarely get homesick, but yeah, sometimes during Christmas or New Year's, New Year's we usually have more unique traditions in Ecuador.

223
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,899
So it's very fun.

224
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:28,960
The family gets together.

225
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:29,720
We dance.

226
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:30,960
We eat.

227
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:38,259
So, but yeah, I've been away from home so long that I rarely get homesick anymore, but it's great to go back and spend time with the family.

228
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:44,120
So after my visit to Ecuador, then I might get homesick for a little while, but then it goes away.

229
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,860
Well, you guys should tell us, do you ever feel homesick and if you do, what do you feel homesick about?

230
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,659
What do you miss?

231
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,519
Maybe mom's cooking, maybe family, maybe the comforts of home.

232
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,519
Yeah.

233
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,740
So we're curious to hear your answers.

234
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,679
We have website EnglishPod.com.

235
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,600
You can of course also leave us questions.

236
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,259
We're happy to answer those.

237
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,700
And until next time, everyone.

238
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:04,379
Bye-bye.
