EnglishPod.com Hi honey!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You'll never guess what.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My friends Julie and Alex are getting married!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Wow, that's great news.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They're a great couple.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I know.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Anyways, I just talked to Alex's best man and he is organizing the bachelor party.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's gonna be so much fun!

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we were gonna do that night.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You aren't going to a strip club, are you?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friend's party.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Aw, come on.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's just some innocent fun.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You know how these things are.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're gonna play drinking games, get him some gag gifts, and just have a good time.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Nothing too over the top.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, I don't know.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Come on.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If one of your friends was getting married, I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette party.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Good.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Because my friend Wendy is getting married and I'm organizing her party.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What?
