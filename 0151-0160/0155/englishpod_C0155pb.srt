00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, Marco, what are we talking about today?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today, we're talking about a very interesting topic.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You've probably seen it on every TV show or American movie, and it's a bachelor party.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Uh-oh.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I've heard bad things.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Bad things about a bachelor party.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, they can be fun, but at times, they can be a little bit too excessive, too much.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But before we get started on the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well the first one we've got here is the topic of today.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is the bachelor party.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So what is a bachelor exactly?

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Right.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, a bachelor is a person who is not married, a single person, a single guy specifically.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
All right.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So it's a man.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Man.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Before he's married.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Right.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Right.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So for women, you would say a bachelorette.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Bachelor is a guy, and a bachelorette is a girl.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And so we don't really say bachelorette except when we're talking about this party.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Right.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So a bachelor party is a party that a guy has the day before he's married or maybe two or three days before he actually gets married.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So it's a night where all his friends get together.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
They go out.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They have some drinks.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They have some fun.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And just like the last extreme fun they will have, he will have before he gets married.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
All right.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And so it's all his guy friends.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All his guy friends.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Only guys.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No girls.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And the bachelorette party is only girls, and it's when a girl's friends take her out before she gets married to celebrate her last night or two of being unmarried.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Right.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Exactly.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So not only guys parties can get a little bit crazy, but girls bachelorette parties can also get kind of crazy, right?

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's true.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So before we start talking about what exactly goes on at some of these parties, let's take a listen to today's dialogue and hear what happens to our main characters.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hi, honey.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You'll never guess what.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
My friends Julie and Alex are getting married.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Wow, that's great news.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They're a great couple.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I know.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Anyways, I just talked to Alex's best man, and he is organizing the bachelor party.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's going to be so much fun.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we were going to do that night.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You aren't going to a strip club, are you?

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friend's party.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Ah, come on.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's just some innocent fun.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You know how these things are.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We're going to play drinking games, get him some gag gifts, and just have a good time.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Nothing too over the top.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, I don't know.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Come on.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If one of your friends was getting married, I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette party.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Good.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because my friend Wendy's getting married, and I'm organizing her party.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What?

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All right, great.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So apparently both of them have parties to go to, but I don't think the guy was too happy about it.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't think so either.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And that's the funny thing.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I think a lot of girls are like, oh, well, my husband-to-be, he wants to have a party.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's okay.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But the minute the girl wants to have the party, the guy is like, uh-uh, no way.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's true.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So I guess, but we can talk a little bit more about this towards the end.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Before we start on this really interesting topic, why don't we take a look at some of the language on Language Takeaway.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Language Takeaway Well, Marco, the first few words are actually more wedding terms than bachelor party terms.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The first one is best man.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Right.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The best man.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So the best man is, who is he exactly?

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He's usually the groom's best friend.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So the groom is the man getting married, and his best friend has the position of best man.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So he has some special things to do at the wedding.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He has to make a speech, for example, and he has to stand next to his friend when the friend gets married.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And it's just a very special position of honor that the best friend has in his friend's wedding.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And among those responsibilities, the best man is usually the one that has to organize the bachelor party, right?

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Exactly.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So best man.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And the rest of the groom's friends are also present at the wedding, and they are called the groomsmen.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
All right.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So groom.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Groomsmen.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And so usually these are maybe three to five guys, three to five men, who are friends of the groom or brother of the bride.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It depends on the wedding.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And they stand with the man when he gets married, and so they kind of have a lot of responsibilities as well.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And the groomsmen usually are also present at the bachelor party.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Exactly.

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All right.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Now moving on to a bit more colorful language, we have a place here, a strip club.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So sometimes you see these in movies oftentimes, or for example, the TV show The Sopranos.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is often a place where Tony Soprano goes.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
A strip club is a club.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's like a bar that's open most of the day and night, where there are women who take their clothes off for money.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
All right.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So you have the verb to strip, right, a strip club.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So the verb to strip means to take off or leave without something.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Right.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So you can strip off your clothes.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So it's usually used with clothes, right, to take off clothes, to strip.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So you have a strip club, and in the strip club, you have, as you mentioned, the girls that are dancing and taking off their clothes, they are called strippers.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So stripper is a person who takes off their clothes as their job, and you can have male strippers or female strippers.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
True.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So usually just saying stripper is a woman, and a male stripper is actually a guy.

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So you have this club that's very common in many countries, and, well, the strippers are dancing, and now they also talked about getting a lap dance.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Now this is getting a little bit, a little dirty.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Lap is a, well, it's not really a part of your body, but when you sit down in a chair, your lap is the tops of your legs, so you can, you know, you can hold something in your lap, like your backpack.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Or maybe, for example, if you have a child that's three or four years old, you would sit him on your lap, right, on your legs while you're sitting down, maybe in the subway.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Right, or a laptop computer is the kind of computer you can hold on your lap.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So a lap dance is when one of the female strippers comes and kind of dances on your lap.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Exactly.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And so it's a sexy dance.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You pay for it extra, and it's something that is very popular with young men and people who, you know, these grooms and groomsmen before the groom gets married.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
All right.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And moving on, we have the last word for today, gag gifts.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
All right.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Gag gifts are joke gifts.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
They're meant to be funny.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They're not meant to be serious, and they're very popular at these kinds of bachelor parties and bachelorette parties.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
One kind of gag gift that's just very silly is like a whoopee cushion.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You know, it's like a balloon you put on someone's seat, and when they sit down, they make a farting sound.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So those are gag gifts.

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Anything that's kind of, to joke around, it's not really useful.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's not like giving somebody a t-shirt, right?

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Right.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Or a gift card is a nice gift.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's not a gag gift.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Right.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So there are a lot of different types of gag gifts, and actually some of them are pretty good and funny, like spicy chewing gum or the electric shocker when you shake somebody's hand.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's really funny.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Zzzz.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
All right.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of words on Language Takeaway, so let's listen to this dialogue again, and we'll be right back with Fluency Builder.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hi, honey.

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You'll never guess what.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
My friends Julie and Alex are getting married.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Wow.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's great news.

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
They're a great couple.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I know.

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Anyways, I just talked to Alex's best man, and he is organizing the bachelor party.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's going to be so much fun.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we were going to do that night.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You aren't going to a strip club, are you?

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friend's party.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Aw, come on.

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's just some innocent fun.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You know how these things are.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We're going to play drinking games, get him some gag gifts, and just have a good time.

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Nothing too over the top.

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, I don't know.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Come on.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If one of your friends was getting married, I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette party.

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Good.

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Because my friend Wendy's getting married, and I'm organizing her party.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What?

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
All right, we're back, so now let's look at some of the phrases that were used in this dialogue on Fluency Builder.

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Fluency Builder.

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:25,000
All right, so at the beginning of this dialogue, we meet this couple, this man and woman, and the guy says, hey, honey, you'll never guess what.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
All right.

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay, my friends are getting married, so what does this mean, you'll never guess what?

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's just a phrase that you would use to give really, really important or exciting news.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's like, guess what?

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay, so you'll never guess what happened to me.

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Right.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I won the lottery.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Right.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's so amazing, or it's so uncommon or unusual that you would probably never guess that person won the lottery.

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay, so you'll never guess what.

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Right.

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You'll never guess what.

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Or you can say, guess what?

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I won the lottery.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
All right.

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And our second phrase.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You know how these things are.

194
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay, so this is a phrase that people often use when they want to remind someone that this is tradition or this is a habit, it's a common thing.

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And so oftentimes when people are having problems that we're going to say, oh, gosh, this person's just not listening to me, someone to help them out will say, you know how these things are.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It takes some time to resolve a problem.

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Or you could say, oh, gosh, this is going to be a horrible party.

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't want you guys to go to a strip club.

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's so dirty.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Right.

201
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And you'd say, well, you know how these things are.

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's tradition.

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You have to do it.

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Right.

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So this is what he meant.

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Right.

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You know how these things are.

208
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's like, I don't really have a choice.

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a tradition.

210
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This is what guys do when they're going to get married.

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So we have to do it.

212
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's almost like saying, don't worry about it.

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
There's really nothing to worry about.

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
All right.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And our last phrase.

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And our last phrase is something that we never want to happen.

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Something to be over the top.

218
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Well, it's not necessarily a bad thing.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay.

220
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So we could say that it was a really ridiculous party.

221
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It was really over the top.

222
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
They had a clown and they had people dressed up like Star Trek characters.

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You know, something that is more than normal.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's almost silly the way that it's all just kind of crazy and, yeah, it's too much in every way.

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So it can be something bad.

226
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Like, for example, someone's behavior was over the top.

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It was too much.

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It was too intense.

229
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Or like, oh my gosh, did you see her coat?

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's really over the top.

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's like purple with sprinkles on it.

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Right.

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So it can be used in different ways.

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But it usually means it's excessive.

235
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's too much.

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
All right.

237
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So some interesting phrases on this occasion as well.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And we'll be back.

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Hi, honey.

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You'll never guess what.

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
My friends Julie and Alex are getting married.

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Wow.

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's great news.

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They're a great couple.

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I know.

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Anyways, I just talked to Alex's best man and he is organizing the bachelor party.

248
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's going to be so much fun.

249
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we were going to do that night.

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You aren't going to a strip club, are you?

251
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friend's party.

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Ah, come on.

253
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's just some innocent fun.

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You know how these things are.

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We're going to play drinking games, get him some gag gifts, and just have a good time.

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Nothing too over the top.

257
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Well, I don't know.

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Come on.

259
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
If one of your friends was getting married, I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette party.

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Good.

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Because my friend Wendy is getting married and I'm organizing her party.

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What?

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Alright, we're back.

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So bachelor and bachelorette parties.

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Have you ever been to a bachelorette party?

266
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I have not yet, but one of my closest friends is getting married in a couple of weeks, and so I will be attending and helping organize a bachelor party.

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So do you have anything in mind?

268
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Nothing I can talk about.

269
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
These things are meant to be surprises oftentimes, so I don't want to spoil it.

270
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But I will tell you that my boyfriend just organized a bachelor party for his best friend.

271
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He was the best man in the wedding.

272
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And it was very crazy.

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Did they also go to Vegas and do some of these things that we saw in the dialogue?

274
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They didn't go to Vegas, but they did some of the things we heard about in today's dialogue.

275
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
They went to a strip club, they got lap dances, they drank a lot.

276
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It was very over the top.

277
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And I think this is something that most of our listeners probably have seen in TV shows or in movies or in different type of exposure of American culture, which is actually very, very common in Canada and the United States.

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm not really sure about Europe.

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
England it is too.

280
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Really?

281
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
My friend said that his friend was getting married and they all went to Portugal for a week to have a bachelor party, and I heard something about mud wrestling.

282
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Wow.

283
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, I guess it's different in every country, and this is the interesting part.

284
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We want to know how these things are in your country.

285
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Do you have any traditions or any fun stuff that you do before the wedding?

286
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Maybe after, I don't know.

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What about Ecuador?

288
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We usually, we don't really have strip clubs actually.

289
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So it's kind of...

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That makes it easy?

291
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah, so we usually just do what we do every night.

292
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Just go out with friends, drink and dance, play the guitar, or yeah, maybe some gag gifts or some prank that we pull on the groom, but nothing too over the top.

293
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So yeah, we're really interested in knowing how it is in your country.

294
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So come to EnglishPod.com, leave your questions, comments, and we'll see you guys next time.

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Until then, bye everyone.

296
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Bye bye.
