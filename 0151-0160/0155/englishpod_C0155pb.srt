00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,580
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,299
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,000
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,679
So, Marco, what are we talking about today?

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,539
Today, we're talking about a very interesting topic.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,719
You've probably seen it on every TV show or American movie, and it's a bachelor party.

7
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:20,640
Uh-oh.

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,519
Yeah.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,579
I've heard bad things.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,440
Bad things about a bachelor party.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,859
Well, they can be fun, but at times, they can be a little bit too excessive, too much.

12
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,399
But before we get started on the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview?

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,759
Well the first one we've got here is the topic of today.

14
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:43,060
This is the bachelor party.

15
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:44,579
So what is a bachelor exactly?

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,179
Right.

17
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,119
Well, a bachelor is a person who is not married, a single person, a single guy specifically.

18
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:50,740
All right.

19
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,560
So it's a man.

20
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,000
Man.

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,899
Before he's married.

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,320
Right.

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,420
Right.

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,020
So for women, you would say a bachelorette.

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,939
Bachelor is a guy, and a bachelorette is a girl.

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,219
And so we don't really say bachelorette except when we're talking about this party.

27
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:04,579
Right.

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:13,819
So a bachelor party is a party that a guy has the day before he's married or maybe two or three days before he actually gets married.

29
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,540
So it's a night where all his friends get together.

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,340
They go out.

31
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,340
They have some drinks.

32
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,280
They have some fun.

33
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,159
And just like the last extreme fun they will have, he will have before he gets married.

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,659
All right.

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,939
And so it's all his guy friends.

36
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,760
All his guy friends.

37
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:29,319
Only guys.

38
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:29,819
No girls.

39
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:40,099
And the bachelorette party is only girls, and it's when a girl's friends take her out before she gets married to celebrate her last night or two of being unmarried.

40
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,599
Right.

41
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,180
Exactly.

42
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:48,879
So not only guys parties can get a little bit crazy, but girls bachelorette parties can also get kind of crazy, right?

43
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,760
That's true.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,620
So before we start talking about what exactly goes on at some of these parties, let's take a listen to today's dialogue and hear what happens to our main characters.

45
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,260
Hi, honey.

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,719
You'll never guess what.

47
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,460
My friends Julie and Alex are getting married.

48
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,800
Wow, that's great news.

49
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,199
They're a great couple.

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,159
I know.

51
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,080
Anyways, I just talked to Alex's best man, and he is organizing the bachelor party.

52
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,740
It's going to be so much fun.

53
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,419
All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we were going to do that night.

54
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,699
You aren't going to a strip club, are you?

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,039
I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friend's party.

56
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:38,099
Ah, come on.

57
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,659
It's just some innocent fun.

58
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,500
You know how these things are.

59
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:45,840
We're going to play drinking games, get him some gag gifts, and just have a good time.

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,460
Nothing too over the top.

61
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,759
Well, I don't know.

62
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:50,740
Come on.

63
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:54,879
If one of your friends was getting married, I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette party.

64
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:56,860
Good.

65
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,240
Because my friend Wendy's getting married, and I'm organizing her party.

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,099
What?

67
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:11,780
All right, great.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,560
So apparently both of them have parties to go to, but I don't think the guy was too happy about it.

69
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,800
I don't think so either.

70
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,939
And that's the funny thing.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,379
I think a lot of girls are like, oh, well, my husband-to-be, he wants to have a party.

72
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:24,840
It's okay.

73
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,900
But the minute the girl wants to have the party, the guy is like, uh-uh, no way.

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,199
That's true.

75
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,319
So I guess, but we can talk a little bit more about this towards the end.

76
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,740
Before we start on this really interesting topic, why don't we take a look at some of the language on Language Takeaway.

77
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:50,460
Language Takeaway Well, Marco, the first few words are actually more wedding terms than bachelor party terms.

78
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,379
The first one is best man.

79
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:52,900
Right.

80
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,860
The best man.

81
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,099
So the best man is, who is he exactly?

82
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,319
He's usually the groom's best friend.

83
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,900
So the groom is the man getting married, and his best friend has the position of best man.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,960
So he has some special things to do at the wedding.

85
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:14,699
He has to make a speech, for example, and he has to stand next to his friend when the friend gets married.

86
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,560
And it's just a very special position of honor that the best friend has in his friend's wedding.

87
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:20,399
Okay.

88
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,500
And among those responsibilities, the best man is usually the one that has to organize the bachelor party, right?

89
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,459
Exactly.

90
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:28,180
Okay.

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,639
So best man.

92
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,360
And the rest of the groom's friends are also present at the wedding, and they are called the groomsmen.

93
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:36,879
All right.

94
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,540
So groom.

95
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,600
Groomsmen.

96
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:46,000
And so usually these are maybe three to five guys, three to five men, who are friends of the groom or brother of the bride.

97
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,339
It depends on the wedding.

98
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,240
And they stand with the man when he gets married, and so they kind of have a lot of responsibilities as well.

99
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:53,660
Okay.

100
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,079
And the groomsmen usually are also present at the bachelor party.

101
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,579
Exactly.

102
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,500
All right.

103
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:06,459
Now moving on to a bit more colorful language, we have a place here, a strip club.

104
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:12,560
So sometimes you see these in movies oftentimes, or for example, the TV show The Sopranos.

105
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,540
This is often a place where Tony Soprano goes.

106
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,379
A strip club is a club.

107
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,079
It's like a bar that's open most of the day and night, where there are women who take their clothes off for money.

108
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:25,579
All right.

109
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:29,259
So you have the verb to strip, right, a strip club.

110
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,120
So the verb to strip means to take off or leave without something.

111
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,600
Right.

112
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,779
So you can strip off your clothes.

113
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,360
So it's usually used with clothes, right, to take off clothes, to strip.

114
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:51,180
So you have a strip club, and in the strip club, you have, as you mentioned, the girls that are dancing and taking off their clothes, they are called strippers.

115
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:51,939
Okay.

116
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:58,300
So stripper is a person who takes off their clothes as their job, and you can have male strippers or female strippers.

117
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,660
True.

118
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:03,040
So usually just saying stripper is a woman, and a male stripper is actually a guy.

119
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,459
Okay.

120
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:13,139
So you have this club that's very common in many countries, and, well, the strippers are dancing, and now they also talked about getting a lap dance.

121
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,040
Okay.

122
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,680
Now this is getting a little bit, a little dirty.

123
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:27,459
Lap is a, well, it's not really a part of your body, but when you sit down in a chair, your lap is the tops of your legs, so you can, you know, you can hold something in your lap, like your backpack.

124
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:36,519
Or maybe, for example, if you have a child that's three or four years old, you would sit him on your lap, right, on your legs while you're sitting down, maybe in the subway.

125
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,000
Right, or a laptop computer is the kind of computer you can hold on your lap.

126
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,459
So a lap dance is when one of the female strippers comes and kind of dances on your lap.

127
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,240
Exactly.

128
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,920
And so it's a sexy dance.

129
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,579
You pay for it extra, and it's something that is very popular with young men and people who, you know, these grooms and groomsmen before the groom gets married.

130
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,620
All right.

131
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,139
And moving on, we have the last word for today, gag gifts.

132
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:06,279
All right.

133
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,019
Gag gifts are joke gifts.

134
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,019
They're meant to be funny.

135
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:16,339
They're not meant to be serious, and they're very popular at these kinds of bachelor parties and bachelorette parties.

136
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,699
One kind of gag gift that's just very silly is like a whoopee cushion.

137
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:27,120
You know, it's like a balloon you put on someone's seat, and when they sit down, they make a farting sound.

138
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,740
So those are gag gifts.

139
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,680
Anything that's kind of, to joke around, it's not really useful.

140
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,519
It's not like giving somebody a t-shirt, right?

141
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:34,779
Right.

142
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,279
Or a gift card is a nice gift.

143
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,019
It's not a gag gift.

144
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,360
Right.

145
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:51,899
So there are a lot of different types of gag gifts, and actually some of them are pretty good and funny, like spicy chewing gum or the electric shocker when you shake somebody's hand.

146
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:52,980
That's really funny.

147
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,319
Zzzz.

148
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,100
All right.

149
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:02,139
So we've taken a look at a lot of words on Language Takeaway, so let's listen to this dialogue again, and we'll be right back with Fluency Builder.

150
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,600
Hi, honey.

151
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,079
You'll never guess what.

152
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,819
My friends Julie and Alex are getting married.

153
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:13,660
Wow.

154
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,699
That's great news.

155
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:16,120
They're a great couple.

156
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,040
I know.

157
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,959
Anyways, I just talked to Alex's best man, and he is organizing the bachelor party.

158
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,620
It's going to be so much fun.

159
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,319
All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we were going to do that night.

160
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,620
You aren't going to a strip club, are you?

161
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,940
I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friend's party.

162
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,980
Aw, come on.

163
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,580
It's just some innocent fun.

164
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,360
You know how these things are.

165
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,740
We're going to play drinking games, get him some gag gifts, and just have a good time.

166
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,360
Nothing too over the top.

167
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,639
Well, I don't know.

168
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,639
Come on.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,799
If one of your friends was getting married, I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette party.

170
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:56,399
Good.

171
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,759
Because my friend Wendy's getting married, and I'm organizing her party.

172
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,500
What?

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,440
All right, we're back, so now let's look at some of the phrases that were used in this dialogue on Fluency Builder.

174
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,059
Fluency Builder.

175
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:25,200
All right, so at the beginning of this dialogue, we meet this couple, this man and woman, and the guy says, hey, honey, you'll never guess what.

176
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:25,820
All right.

177
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,639
Okay, my friends are getting married, so what does this mean, you'll never guess what?

178
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,679
It's just a phrase that you would use to give really, really important or exciting news.

179
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:35,480
It's like, guess what?

180
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,539
Okay, so you'll never guess what happened to me.

181
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:38,919
Right.

182
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:39,940
I won the lottery.

183
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:40,399
Right.

184
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,200
It's so amazing, or it's so uncommon or unusual that you would probably never guess that person won the lottery.

185
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,860
Okay, so you'll never guess what.

186
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,179
Right.

187
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:49,120
You'll never guess what.

188
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,279
Or you can say, guess what?

189
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:51,120
I won the lottery.

190
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:51,960
Okay.

191
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,440
All right.

192
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,919
And our second phrase.

193
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:56,080
You know how these things are.

194
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:05,279
Okay, so this is a phrase that people often use when they want to remind someone that this is tradition or this is a habit, it's a common thing.

195
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:15,320
And so oftentimes when people are having problems that we're going to say, oh, gosh, this person's just not listening to me, someone to help them out will say, you know how these things are.

196
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,279
It takes some time to resolve a problem.

197
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,580
Or you could say, oh, gosh, this is going to be a horrible party.

198
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,639
I don't want you guys to go to a strip club.

199
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,500
It's so dirty.

200
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,000
Right.

201
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:28,980
And you'd say, well, you know how these things are.

202
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,419
It's tradition.

203
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,440
You have to do it.

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,200
Right.

205
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,879
So this is what he meant.

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,080
Right.

207
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,139
You know how these things are.

208
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,159
It's like, I don't really have a choice.

209
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,080
It's a tradition.

210
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,519
This is what guys do when they're going to get married.

211
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,899
So we have to do it.

212
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,139
It's almost like saying, don't worry about it.

213
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,340
There's really nothing to worry about.

214
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:45,860
All right.

215
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,659
And our last phrase.

216
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,580
And our last phrase is something that we never want to happen.

217
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,259
Something to be over the top.

218
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,340
Well, it's not necessarily a bad thing.

219
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:54,700
Okay.

220
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,159
So we could say that it was a really ridiculous party.

221
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,519
It was really over the top.

222
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:05,019
They had a clown and they had people dressed up like Star Trek characters.

223
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,659
You know, something that is more than normal.

224
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:14,600
It's almost silly the way that it's all just kind of crazy and, yeah, it's too much in every way.

225
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,340
So it can be something bad.

226
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,720
Like, for example, someone's behavior was over the top.

227
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,460
It was too much.

228
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,360
It was too intense.

229
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,639
Or like, oh my gosh, did you see her coat?

230
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,840
It's really over the top.

231
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,220
It's like purple with sprinkles on it.

232
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:26,820
Right.

233
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,919
So it can be used in different ways.

234
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,899
But it usually means it's excessive.

235
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,820
It's too much.

236
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:33,220
All right.

237
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,820
So some interesting phrases on this occasion as well.

238
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,120
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

239
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,139
And we'll be back.

240
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,919
Hi, honey.

241
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,379
You'll never guess what.

242
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,139
My friends Julie and Alex are getting married.

243
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:55,460
Wow.

244
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,519
That's great news.

245
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,899
They're a great couple.

246
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,820
I know.

247
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,720
Anyways, I just talked to Alex's best man and he is organizing the bachelor party.

248
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,399
It's going to be so much fun.

249
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,080
All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we were going to do that night.

250
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,399
You aren't going to a strip club, are you?

251
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:18,679
I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friend's party.

252
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,720
Ah, come on.

253
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,320
It's just some innocent fun.

254
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,139
You know how these things are.

255
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:28,500
We're going to play drinking games, get him some gag gifts, and just have a good time.

256
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:30,120
Nothing too over the top.

257
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,399
Well, I don't know.

258
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,419
Come on.

259
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,559
If one of your friends was getting married, I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette party.

260
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,519
Good.

261
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,899
Because my friend Wendy is getting married and I'm organizing her party.

262
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:43,759
What?

263
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,960
Alright, we're back.

264
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,720
So bachelor and bachelorette parties.

265
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,220
Have you ever been to a bachelorette party?

266
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:08,779
I have not yet, but one of my closest friends is getting married in a couple of weeks, and so I will be attending and helping organize a bachelor party.

267
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:09,980
So do you have anything in mind?

268
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,639
Nothing I can talk about.

269
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,620
These things are meant to be surprises oftentimes, so I don't want to spoil it.

270
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:21,279
But I will tell you that my boyfriend just organized a bachelor party for his best friend.

271
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
He was the best man in the wedding.

272
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,679
And it was very crazy.

273
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Did they also go to Vegas and do some of these things that we saw in the dialogue?

274
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,620
They didn't go to Vegas, but they did some of the things we heard about in today's dialogue.

275
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,159
They went to a strip club, they got lap dances, they drank a lot.

276
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:38,879
It was very over the top.

277
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:55,940
And I think this is something that most of our listeners probably have seen in TV shows or in movies or in different type of exposure of American culture, which is actually very, very common in Canada and the United States.

278
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm not really sure about Europe.

279
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,679
England it is too.

280
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:58,919
Really?

281
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:07,799
My friend said that his friend was getting married and they all went to Portugal for a week to have a bachelor party, and I heard something about mud wrestling.

282
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:09,740
Wow.

283
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,980
Well, I guess it's different in every country, and this is the interesting part.

284
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,440
We want to know how these things are in your country.

285
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,039
Do you have any traditions or any fun stuff that you do before the wedding?

286
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,059
Maybe after, I don't know.

287
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,799
What about Ecuador?

288
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,679
We usually, we don't really have strip clubs actually.

289
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,539
So it's kind of...

290
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:27,940
That makes it easy?

291
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:32,159
Yeah, so we usually just do what we do every night.

292
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:42,620
Just go out with friends, drink and dance, play the guitar, or yeah, maybe some gag gifts or some prank that we pull on the groom, but nothing too over the top.

293
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:46,480
So yeah, we're really interested in knowing how it is in your country.

294
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,419
So come to EnglishPod.com, leave your questions, comments, and we'll see you guys next time.

295
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,179
Until then, bye everyone.

296
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:53,620
Bye bye.
