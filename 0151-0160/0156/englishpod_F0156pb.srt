00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Oh no, the lights went out.

2
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:10,419
Honey, can you light a candle?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Sure, what do we do now?

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,059
Well, we can just talk, you know, like we used to.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,800
I know, I'll tell you a scary story.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,399
It happened to me and my dad when I was a teenager.

7
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,559
I was living with my father at the time when he received a phone call.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,399
Hello, yes, this is him.

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,039
I see, sorry to hear that.

10
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,100
Okay, no problem, I'll be there shortly.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,020
Pack some clothes Tony, my great aunt is very ill and no one in the family wants to take care of her.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,979
We are going to stay at her house for a few days.

13
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:47,979
Aunt?

14
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:48,939
What aunt?

15
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,679
I never knew you had a great aunt.

16
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,079
Well, the family doesn't talk about her or get near her for that matter.

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,399
Why is that?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Come on, we have to go.

19
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,679
So we arrived at this old house on the outskirts of our town.

20
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:07,159
There was almost no one around and the house had an eerie look to it.

21
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:14,959
Once inside the house, we walked to her room and I was surprised to find my dad's great aunt in a wheelchair yelling at someone.

22
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,659
But we were alone in the room.

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,939
Hi Aunt Ursula, this is my son Tony.

24
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,060
Why have you come?

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,819
Why are you here?

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,060
Don't you know?

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,459
It isn't safe.

28
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,099
My time is near.

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,060
He's coming for me.

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,700
Who is coming for you?

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,719
The Prince of Darkness, the Lord of the Underworld, the Temptor, the Old Serpent.

32
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:44,340
Come on, Aunt Ursula, let's lay you down.

33
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:45,599
You need to get some rest.

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,760
Tony, help me lay her down.

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,780
That night, we slept in one of the twelve rooms of that big old mansion.

36
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,239
The trees outside seemed to come alive and their shadows formed googly shapes on my bed.

37
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,620
All of a sudden, we heard screaming.

38
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,680
Dad, dad, dad!

39
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,599
Something is attacking Aunt Ursula!

40
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,819
Help me, dad, before you can take me!

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,159
The door is jammed!

42
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,080
Stand back!

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,960
Aunt Ursula, where are you?

44
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:29,120
Over here!

45
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:40,620
And as we approached her, she was lying on the floor with her hands and feet open like the Vitruvian Man, breathing heavily with bloody marks and scratches on her arms, legs, and face.

46
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,699
Remember how I mentioned that she was in a wheelchair?

47
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:47,780
My aunt had been paralyzed from the neck down for just over a year.

48
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:57,599
After this incident, strange things would happen in the house and my aunt would yell and scream, according to her, warding off the evil that had come to get her.

49
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,580
As the days passed, she became very weak and eventually was unable to talk.

50
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,520
My dad had to work during the day, so I was left to care for her.

51
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,659
When she lost her voice and laid on her deathbed, I would hear her breathe in and out.

52
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:24,939
And finally, one day, she breathed in and never exhaled.

53
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:28,680
That night, I felt relieved that it was finally over.

54
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:29,960
But it wasn't.

55
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:40,400
I was so terrified of what I was hearing that I didn't sleep all night.

56
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,139
The following morning, I went to the bathroom, expecting to find a mess and everything torn up.

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,080
But I found everything exactly as it was before.

58
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:59,199
The movers came that same day and as we were cleaning out her drawers and personal items, we found strange notebooks with names and amounts of money written next to them.

59
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,400
We found pictures with people's faces sewn with black or red string.

60
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,259
And you want to know what the strangest thing was?

61
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:12,979
There was a small doll filled with dead ants with a strand of hair tied around its waist.

62
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:19,579
And on the doll's face, there was a picture of me with the numbers 31-10-09.

63
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,980
You know what date it is today?

64
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,000
October 31, 2009.
