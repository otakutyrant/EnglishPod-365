00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Oh no, the lights went out.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Honey, can you light a candle?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sure, what do we do now?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, we can just talk, you know, like we used to.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I know, I'll tell you a scary story.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It happened to me and my dad when I was a teenager.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was living with my father at the time when he received a phone call.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello, yes, this is him.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I see, sorry to hear that.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, no problem, I'll be there shortly.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Pack some clothes Tony, my great aunt is very ill and no one in the family wants to take care of her.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We are going to stay at her house for a few days.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Aunt?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What aunt?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I never knew you had a great aunt.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, the family doesn't talk about her or get near her for that matter.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Why is that?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Come on, we have to go.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So we arrived at this old house on the outskirts of our town.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There was almost no one around and the house had an eerie look to it.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Once inside the house, we walked to her room and I was surprised to find my dad's great aunt in a wheelchair yelling at someone.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But we were alone in the room.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hi Aunt Ursula, this is my son Tony.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Why have you come?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Why are you here?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't you know?

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It isn't safe.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My time is near.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He's coming for me.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Who is coming for you?

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The Prince of Darkness, the Lord of the Underworld, the Temptor, the Old Serpent.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Come on, Aunt Ursula, let's lay you down.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You need to get some rest.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Tony, help me lay her down.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That night, we slept in one of the twelve rooms of that big old mansion.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The trees outside seemed to come alive and their shadows formed googly shapes on my bed.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
All of a sudden, we heard screaming.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Dad, dad, dad!

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Something is attacking Aunt Ursula!

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Help me, dad, before you can take me!

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The door is jammed!

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Stand back!

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Aunt Ursula, where are you?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Over here!

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And as we approached her, she was lying on the floor with her hands and feet open like the Vitruvian Man, breathing heavily with bloody marks and scratches on her arms, legs, and face.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Remember how I mentioned that she was in a wheelchair?

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
My aunt had been paralyzed from the neck down for just over a year.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
After this incident, strange things would happen in the house and my aunt would yell and scream, according to her, warding off the evil that had come to get her.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
As the days passed, she became very weak and eventually was unable to talk.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My dad had to work during the day, so I was left to care for her.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
When she lost her voice and laid on her deathbed, I would hear her breathe in and out.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And finally, one day, she breathed in and never exhaled.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That night, I felt relieved that it was finally over.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But it wasn't.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I was so terrified of what I was hearing that I didn't sleep all night.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The following morning, I went to the bathroom, expecting to find a mess and everything torn up.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But I found everything exactly as it was before.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The movers came that same day and as we were cleaning out her drawers and personal items, we found strange notebooks with names and amounts of money written next to them.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We found pictures with people's faces sewn with black or red string.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And you want to know what the strangest thing was?

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
There was a small doll filled with dead ants with a strand of hair tied around its waist.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And on the doll's face, there was a picture of me with the numbers 31-10-09.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You know what date it is today?

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
October 31, 2009.
