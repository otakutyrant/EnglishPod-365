00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And my name is Catherine and today we have a very scary story.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Spooky.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're actually bringing you the first of our advanced media lessons and what better way to start it with than a scary story for Halloween.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Than with.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Than with.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So what better way to start this advanced media lesson than with a scary story.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Right, so Halloween is coming up and advanced media usually features a new story or some kind of story that we can then kind of break down and talk about, just have a conversation about because you're advanced level learners and you want to have fun with English.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So where is today's spooky story set, Marco?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, it starts out with a guy who remembers something very scary that happened to him when he was a kid.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, and so one of the main characters in today's story is his great aunt.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's right, his great aunt.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So basically this is a family member but it's your father's aunt.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Right, your grandmother or your grandfather's sister.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Right.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So your aunt or your aunt is your parent's sibling.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But in this case we're talking about one generation older than that.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So you could say great aunt, great uncle, great grandfather, great grandmother.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's like one step back.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Right.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So this is usually a very old person and the great aunt is definitely an important character in today's story.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Exactly.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So let's not keep you in suspense any longer.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Why don't we listen to this scary story and we'll be right back to talk about it.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh no, the lights went out.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Honey, can you light a candle?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Sure.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What do we do now?

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, we can just talk.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You know, like we used to.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I know.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll tell you a scary story.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It happened to me and my dad when I was a teenager.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I was living with my father at the time when he received a phone call.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hello.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, this is him.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I see.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sorry to hear that.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, no clothes, Tony.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My great aunt is very ill and no one in the family wants to take care of her.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We're going to stay at her house for a few days.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Aunt?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What aunt?

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I never knew you had a great aunt.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, the family doesn't talk about her or get near her for that matter.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why is that?

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Come on, we have to go.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So we arrived at this old house on the outskirts of our town.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There was almost no one around and the house had an eerie look to it.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Once inside the house, we walked to her room and I was surprised to find my dad's great aunt in a wheelchair yelling at someone, but we were alone in the room.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hi, Aunt Ursula.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is my son, Tony.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why have you come?

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why are you here?

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't you know?

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It isn't safe.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My time is near.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He's coming for me.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Who is coming for you?

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The Prince of Darkness, the Lord of the Underworld, the Temptor, the Old Serpent.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Come on, Aunt Ursula, let's lay you down.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You need to get some rest.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Tony, help me lay her down.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That night, we slept in one of the twelve rooms of that big old mansion.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The trees outside seemed to come alive and their shadows formed googly shapes on my bed.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
All of a sudden, we heard screaming.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hi, Aunt Ursula.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Please, I won't let you take me.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Dad, Dad, Dad, something is attacking Aunt Ursula.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Go back to the underworld, you seaman.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I shall be judged before you can take me.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The door is jammed.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Stand back.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Aunt Ursula, where are you?

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Over here.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And as we approached her, she was lying on the floor with her hands and feet open like the Vitruvian Man, breathing heavily with bloody marks and scratches on her arms, legs and face.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Remember how I mentioned that she was in a wheelchair?

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
My aunt had been paralyzed from the neck down for just over a year.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
After this incident, strange things would happen in the house and my aunt would yell and scream, according to her, warding off the evil that had come to get her.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
As the days passed, she became very weak and eventually was unable to talk.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
My dad had to work during the day, so I was left to care for her.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
When she lost her voice and laid on her deathbed, I would hear her breathe in and out.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Until finally one day, she breathed in and never exhaled.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That night, I felt relieved that it was finally over.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But it wasn't.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I was so terrified of what I was hearing that I didn't sleep all night.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The following morning, I went to the bathroom, expecting to find a mess and everything torn up.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But I found everything exactly as it was before.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The movers came that same day and as we were cleaning out her drawers and personal items, we found strange notebooks with names and amounts of money written next to them.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We found pictures with people's faces sewn with black or red string.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And you want to know what the strangest thing was?

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There was a small doll filled with dead ants, with a strand of hair tied around its waist.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And on the doll's face, there was a picture of me with the numbers 31-10-09.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You know what date it is today?

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
October 31st, 2009.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
All right, we're back.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So what do you think?

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Pretty scary?

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I got goosebumps.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's a little spooky.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Now, what's interesting about this story, it's based on a true story.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So that makes it even scarier.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Dare I ask, did this happen to you?

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No, no, I'm not old enough.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But this actually happened to a family member of mine.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And that's why I know this story.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So it was kind of told to me when I was a bit younger and I remembered it.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And well, Halloween is a great time to remember these things.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And the first time you heard it, it scared the crap out of you, right?

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh yeah, for sure.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Actually, the first time I heard it, we were on an airplane like on October 31st.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, wow.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So it was pretty scary.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, we've got a lot of really interesting stuff here.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We're not going to dwell too long on the grammar or the vocabulary because we assume that most of you have understood this.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But there are a couple of things that can be really difficult even for English speakers.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So the first one is this phrase.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My time is near.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
My time is near.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So what does that mean exactly?

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, my time is near.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My end is coming.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It means I'm very old and I'm probably going to die soon.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So my time, his time, that's when you die.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
OK, so it's always used in reference to death, right?

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
In this case, yeah.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So it's used in reference to death.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And in this case, we have the aunt who's talking about herself.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But you could also say his time is coming.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We should visit him in the hospital.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So it's a kind of softer way of saying that someone is going to die soon.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Right.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
OK, so my time is near or his time is near.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
All right.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And then something really interesting in this story as well.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
She had many different names that she called the devil.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So she didn't directly say the devil.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
She said the prince of darkness, prince of darkness, lord of the underworld, the tempter, the tempter and the old serpent.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So these are actually different ways that historically have been used to describe the devil.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's right.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And a lot of them are biblical, like the old serpent, you know, back in the first the first pages of the Bible when the serpent tempts Eve.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's that's exactly.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And so we hear a lot of these, especially on Halloween.

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
These are great words to use to to kind of diversify and not say devil, devil, devil.

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Right.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
OK.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So apart from those synonyms for the devil, she also used an interesting phrase towards the end when she said, I shall be judged before you can take me.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Hmm.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So judged to judge.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This is to see if something is right or wrong.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But in this case, we talk about judgment at the end of a person's life.

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So that means when you go to the gates of heaven and there's St.

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Peter and he has a list of the good and the bad and he says yes or no.

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Right.

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And then if you're if you're if you're a no, you get sent down to hell here.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes, you go to heaven.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So she says I shall be judged.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This means I want my day in court.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I want to to have my actions analyzed by St.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Peter, not by you.

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Right.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Exactly.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So actually, this makes reference to a lot of beliefs in Christianity.

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Right.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So it's just another in another aspect of the story.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But of course, but other religions probably don't have the same things such as the gates of heaven and St.

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Peter.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Right.

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The system of the system of judgment.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
All right.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So what do you think of the story?

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Did you did you like it?

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I really liked it.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I I thought it was really spooky and I thought that it built up well.

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But I really I also like the imagery we talked about or we haven't talked about this yet, but he describes he describes his great aunt.

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The character describes great as being spread out like the Vitruvian man.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So you have this image of her arms spread out and her legs spread out.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You know, that picture that Da Vinci did of of a human being and it's like an anatomy and it's in a circle and you can see the legs and the arms.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's just so really like a powerful visual image.

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah, you can imagine her laying on the bed in this position, right?

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, it is pretty scary.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What about you?

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Have you ever had any close encounters with the supernatural or ghosts or goblins or something like this?

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No, personally, I've never had any experiences like that.

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I tend to not believe those stories.

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But maybe maybe if this had happened to someone I knew I'd be a little bit more skeptical or less skeptical.

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But what about like when they have those documentaries or those recordings of strange voices or appearances like these old castles in England or stuff like that?

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What do you think?

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I love those shows.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I just watched one and it was about a haunted house.

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There was a woman who used a Ouija board and it let a demon out and the demon possessed the girl and they called in a priest and the priest had to like exorcise the demon from the little girl and the house was haunted and it was hurting people and it was like possessing people.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Wow, it sounds like a movie.

195
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, it does.

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But it was like a TV show on Discovery Channel and it was really, really fun.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But like I don't actually believe that like a spirit could push someone down the stairs.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I think that you trip and then you attribute it to a spirit.

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Right.

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What about the Ouija board?

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's an interesting tool that many people say opens up portals and dimensions towards hell or spirits can come out and stuff like that.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Right, well for those of you who don't know the Ouija board is a board like a piece of cardboard that has letters on it, letters and numbers and so you have this glass that you hold and once the spirit comes it guides the glass to point out to names or places and you spell them.

203
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And they're really popular with like 13 year old girls who have these slumber parties and they use it and we have to say, you know, who is she going to date and then it moves.

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But yeah, I believe in the power of the human mind.

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So I think a lot of times, even if we're not aware of it, we're the ones manipulating this or believing what we want to believe.

206
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah.

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But what about you?

208
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Are you superstitious?

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Are you believe in ghosts?

210
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm not superstitious.

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know what to think about ghosts because I've actually had a couple of very strange encounters with the supernatural but I really wouldn't say, oh yeah, I believe in ghosts or I believe they're spirits that haven't been put to rest or they have unfinished business, you know, like in Casper or something like that.

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah.

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But once we were having dinner with my family and in the house where we used to live and it was a very old house and we had a glass of water on the table and all of a sudden it started to move and to rotate across the table, the center of the table and we all saw it and no one was touching it.

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So we all were pretty confused and nervous and then just kind of burst out in nervous laughter and we didn't really know what to make of it.

215
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But it was very strange because it moved a good amount towards like half of the table and it was spinning at the same time so it was very strange.

216
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Weird.

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So things like this and, you know, in general, Hispanic or Latin American culture are, they're very superstitious.

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
They have a lot of beliefs in like magic or some people still say are reluctant to give out a picture, for example, because of something like this in the story.

219
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Really?

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:25,000
They say you shouldn't give out pictures to boyfriends or girlfriends or anyone because if you break up or something is to happen then they could do something with that picture and maybe hurt you.

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Really?

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So this idea that you have a likeness, like a picture or a doll or something, can you talk about that?

223
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Because I don't really know anything about it.

224
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Having that means that you're able to like do something to that very person?

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, like not necessarily like a voodoo doll, right?

226
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Where you see that you can put pins in it and then it would hurt someone.

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But people believe that pictures, for example, they capture your image and so if somebody has it and wants to do harm or black magic then they can use that as a instrument to get into you.

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The same as pieces of clothing or the same as hair and things like this.

229
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So that's why there are the shamans or the Indian witch doctors who do cleansing like this and people still actually go tour them.

230
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:28,000
People in the city still believe in these things and they'll go to a shaman and get themselves cleansed because they believe that their luck, they have really bad luck or they've been very, very sick for a long time and doctors can't figure out what it is.

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
They think it's because someone has cast a spell on them or is doing some black magic to them and they need to get it cleansed.

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So yeah, it's really, really common.

233
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But it's all part of the folklore and the heritage of the countries.

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's actually very, very interesting and some things are just really out there, really weird.

235
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Well, a lot of it I think comes from indigenous beliefs mixing with Catholicism too, right?

236
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Because a lot of South American countries and Latin American countries are very Catholic, but they get kind of melded, these traditions with indigenous beliefs and then you have these crazy rituals.

237
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We actually have a belief and it's very true that when somebody is completely in love with this girl and this girl is maybe not very nice or not very nice to that guy, but he's still completely into her.

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So there's this word that we say that he's been under-weired or something like that.

239
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And the reason behind this is that one of these rituals that I talked about is that the girl would make tea, right?

240
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Would take a teapot and in it would put her underpants, used underpants to make the tea water and then would serve it to the guy.

241
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So the moment that he drank it, this was like a magic potion and he would continuously be in love with her.

242
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So yeah, it's very strange.

243
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's gross.

244
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Do people actually do that?

245
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No, it's not something that you do now, but it's something that people knew about that used to be done way, way before.

246
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay, so people now, it's part of the language where you say that someone has been under-weired or something like that.

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
She cast a spell on him, maybe what we would say.

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So things like this that of course aren't really done anymore, but still people make reference to it because we know it from our history that it's been done before.

249
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,000
How cool.

250
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, I'm really curious to know if our users have any similar stories or have any scary stories they want to tell.

251
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I bet they do.

252
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm sure they do.

253
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And this advanced media lesson is a great place for you to do that because we expect that a lot of advanced level learners are going to be listening to it and practicing your writing is really important.

254
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So we hope that you'll put some comments on this lesson and of course ask us as many questions as you want.

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Alright, so we'll see you guys there and have a happy Halloween.

256
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Happy Halloween.

257
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Bye.
