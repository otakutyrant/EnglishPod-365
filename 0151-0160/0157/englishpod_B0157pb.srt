00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello everyone, and welcome back to another lesson at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And my name is Kathryn, and in the spirit of Halloween, we have a Halloween lesson for you.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Happy Halloween...

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's Halloween.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's Halloween.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And this is an elementary level lesson, so we're talking about some basic but important things today.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Exactly.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So we're not going to preview anything because the dialogue is pretty simple, so why don't we listen to it for the first time, and we'll be right back.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Trick or treat!

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tom, aren't you a little too old to be trick or treating?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Where's your Halloween spirit?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Didn't you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick or treating with your friends?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Of course I did, but when I was 10, trick or treating is for kids.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Plus, I'm sure people will think you're a kidnapper or something, running around with kids at night.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Whatever.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going next door.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I heard Mrs.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Robinson is giving out big bags of M&Ms.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Alright, we're back, so trick or treating.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Ding dong.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ding dong.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Trick or treat.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Alright, so we're going to explain what trick or treating is just in a little bit, but before we get into it, why don't we take a look at four important words in language takeaway.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Language takeaway.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, the first one, Marco, is very important because it's the name of this special holiday that isn't celebrated everywhere.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's only celebrated in some places, and Americans, I think, love it above all else.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Right, yeah, Halloween.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, this actually comes from All Hallows' Eve, right?

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right, so it's the night of the spirits of the dead.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Right, exactly, so the day of the dead, and as Catherine mentions, it's celebrated in different ways in different countries, but I think probably the United States is one of the few where people dress up and go trick or treating.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right, and Halloween is the last day of October, so October 31st, and it's a really fun holiday where mostly children dress up in costumes and they ask for candy.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All right, so to dress up means to get in a costume?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Right, well, you could say dress up to mean a couple of different things, but in this case, you dress up in a costume, so that means you change your clothes so that you're wearing a costume, which is maybe a witch's costume or a vampire or something scary.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So you would say he dressed up as a vampire.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He dressed up as a vampire, or they got dressed up for the wedding.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, very good.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So dress up, and then we have the word kidnapper.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So the friend is afraid that his friend will look like a kidnapper if he goes out trick or treating with the kids, and so a kidnapper comes from the word to take or to grab, so kid grabber, and that means that you're going to take children from the streets and steal them.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Right, but you can kidnap an adult, right, so it's not only for kids.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right, it's for any kind of person who you take without them wanting you to, so against their will.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay, kidnapper.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And finally, we have M&Ms.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What are M&Ms?

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Not the singer, right?

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, M&M is spelled differently, the singer.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is a delicious chocolate treat.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a candy, and it comes in big brown bags, and if you want them with peanuts, they come in a yellow bag.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You know your M&Ms.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, man, I could tell you all the colors, but M&Ms are really delicious, and it's actually a brand, M&Ms.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's a brand.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Right, so many people will probably know it, but just in case, they're called M&Ms, very good candy.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:10,000
All right, so these words were relatively easy and simple, so why don't we listen to our dialogue again, let's slow it down just a little bit, and we'll be right back to take a look at Fluency Builder.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Fluency Builder.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
All right, we're back.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So on Fluency Builder, we promised that we were going to look at this word trick or treating, so let's look at it now.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Trick or treat.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a verb, right?

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
To trick or treat.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
To trick or treat, and it comes from the words that we say when we're children to the person whose door we knock on.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, for example, I say...

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And then I open the door?

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mm-hmm.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I say, trick or treat.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay, so what are you supposed to do in this when somebody says trick or treat?

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, I'm a child, I'm holding my bag, and you're supposed to say, happy Halloween, and give me some candy.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All right, so trick or treat means you could either trick someone, you could play a trick on them, like scare them or put some toilet paper on their house, or you can give them a treat.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Uh-huh.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Or accept a treat, and so the idea is, if you don't give me a treat, I will do something bad to you.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Ah, I see.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But this doesn't really happen, right?

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Like, when kids go to people's houses, they say, trick or treat, and then they get candy automatically.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Almost automatically, yeah.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sometimes people avoid the holiday, and they close their doors and lock them, and they don't answer the door.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And that's when someone maybe throws an egg at the house, or does something mean- Or puts toilet paper on their trees.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah, yeah.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So, trick or treat is what we say, but it's also something we can do, so we can go trick or treating.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Go trick or treating.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Right, okay.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Very good.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Trick or treat.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And now we have another phrase here that's a little bit complicated, but when the friend answered the door, he said, aren't you a little too old to be trick or treating?

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
All right, I like this phrase because it's sarcastic.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The person is not asking a real question, he's saying, listen, you are too old to be trick or treating.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And so, in this case, aren't you, is a way to introduce something that we know is true, that we think is true.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's kind of rude and sarcastic.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So if I say, aren't you supposed to be at work?

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Right?

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, it's in that form, you're not really asking a question, you're more demanding an explanation.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Right, it's a suggestion, it's like, you're probably supposed to be at work right now.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Right, right.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So Marco, aren't you supposed to be at school right now?

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So do we always, but we always use it in that sense, right?

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Aren't you, and then.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, aren't you, aren't you a little old for that kind of an outfit?

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
All right.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So aren't you?

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
All right, very good.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So those are the two phrases for Fluency Builder today.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's listen quickly to our dialogue one more time, and we'll be right back.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Trick or treat!

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Tom, aren't you a little too old to be trick or treating?

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Where's your Halloween spirit?

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Didn't you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick or treating with your friends?

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Of course I did, but when I was ten, trick or treating is for kids.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Plus, I'm sure people will think you're a kidnapper or something, running around with kids at night.

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Whatever.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm going next door.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I heard Mrs.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Robinson is giving out big bags of M&M's.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
All right, so Marco, have you ever trick or treated?

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I didn't.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I did.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I used to go trick or treating when I was little, and it was actually really fun.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We used to have competitions about who had the most candy.

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I've heard about this.

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Right, because you don't necessarily bring a bag, you bring a pillowcase, and you fill your pillowcase with candy.

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Now, the interesting thing is that sometimes you wouldn't necessarily only get candy from people.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Right, sometimes you got weird things, like pennies, or toothbrushes, or apples.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, so you would go to someone's house and they would give you an apple, you'd be like, okay.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But there was always an old lady who lived near, well, she lived in the neighborhood, and every neighborhood had one, you know?

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
All my friends had a lady they would go to, and she gave the full-size candy bars.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Wow.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right, because normally stores sell small candy bars for the Halloween holiday, because they're smaller, they're cheaper, it's easier to give them to many people.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But there's always one person who has the big full-size candy bars, and everyone goes to her.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Right, exactly.

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And actually, it's amazing how Halloween is such an important event in the States, because everyone dresses up, everyone puts out decorations or pumpkins outside of their homes.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They have pumpkin carving contests, which are really cool, how they carve out pumpkins.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They make faces in the pumpkins, and then we can put a candle inside to light it up.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's really fun.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So that's called a jack-o-lantern, right?

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's right.

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Why is it called a jack-o-lantern, do you know?

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I have no idea.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's weird.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Maybe it's like a person looks like a person's face.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Maybe a jack-o-lantern.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Because a lantern is a light, it's like a light with a candle in it, so.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's actually a very fun holiday.

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's really interesting, and it's kind of strange when people really oppose it because they say that it has to do with the devil, or it has to do ...

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's a pagan ritual and things like this, but it's just good fun.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's fun, it's silly, everyone likes to dress up in a costume.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What was the weirdest costume that you've dressed up as?

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
As an adult or a child?

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Because I know you've dressed up as an adult as well.

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I dress up every year.

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I was Pippi Longstocking last year.

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well, as a child, one year, I dressed up as an injured soldier, because my dad was in the military, so we always had fatigues around the house.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So I used his fatigues, and I put blood on my face, and I had crutches.

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
People thought that I really had a broken leg, so they used to give me double ...

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They gave me that.

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They gave me double the candy, because they thought, oh, here's a poor girl in crutches.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And trick-or-treating.

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
