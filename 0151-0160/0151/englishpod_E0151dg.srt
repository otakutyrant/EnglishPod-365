00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:09,119
EnglishPod.com Man, it's been forever!

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,519
What have you been up to lately?

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,980
I've been busy preparing for my exams, not to mention all the term papers I've had to write.

4
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:16,859
Same here.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,719
I'm up to my neck in work, but at least we've got summer holidays after finals.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,260
Where are you headed now?

7
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:23,920
I'm going to my anthro class.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,280
We've been focusing on Darwin all term, since it's the 200th anniversary of his birth or whatever.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,479
I'm sick and tired of Darwin, Darwin, Darwin!

10
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:33,100
What?

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:33,840
Why?

12
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:35,460
How can you not like Darwin?

13
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:39,719
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,460
His theory of evolution revolutionized the fields of biology and anthropology.

15
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't like him.

16
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,939
His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,219
It's not as solid as you make it out to be.

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,299
Say that again and you'll make enemies with half of the academy, not to mention your professors.

19
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:08,319
Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of the species and the process of natural selection constitutes a grand step towards a coherent understanding of the world and its very beginnings.

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,959
I'm not minimizing his huge contributions to science.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,579
It's just that his theory reminds me of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,379
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,400
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,780
This is a classic logical problem, and I think it applies to Darwin's theory.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,640
How did the very first living organism come to be?

26
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:28,939
Interesting.

27
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,719
I think that question is better suited for my philosophy class.

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,060
In the meantime, how about we settle this with a duel?
