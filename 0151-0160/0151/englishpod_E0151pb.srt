00:00:03,099 --> 00:00:06,120
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,780
We have an advanced lesson for you today.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,500
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,419
And my name is Catherine, and I'm very excited about this lesson, Marco.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,880
It's very interesting.

6
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:19,579
It's about a very controversial topic and a very popular person in history, Charles Darwin.

7
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,140
That's right.

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,160
So he's most famous, perhaps, for his book, The Origin of the Species.

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,559
And we're going to be talking a lot about science today, so put your thinking caps on.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,239
All right.

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,899
So without further ado, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time?

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,780
I'm focusing on Darwin all term, since it's the 200th anniversary of his birth or whatever.

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,920
I'm sick and tired of Darwin, Darwin, Darwin.

14
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:07,599
What?

15
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,319
Why?

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,959
How can you not like Darwin?

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,239
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,980
His theory of evolution revolutionized the fields of biology and anthropology.

19
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,500
I don't like him.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,439
His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes.

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
It's not as solid as you make it out to be.

22
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:31,819
Say that again and you'll make enemies with half of the academy, not to mention your professors.

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:42,859
Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of the species and the process of natural selection constitutes a grand step towards a coherent understanding of the world and its very beginnings.

24
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:46,459
I'm not minimizing his huge contributions to science.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,079
It's just that his theory reminds me of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

26
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,879
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,920
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

28
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:59,280
This is a classic logical problem and I think it applies to Darwin's theory.

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,200
How did the very first living organism come to be?

30
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:03,459
Interesting.

31
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,239
I think that question is better suited for my philosophy class.

32
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,599
In the meantime, how about we settle this with a duel?

33
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:22,280
All right, interesting.

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,300
They have very different views on Charles Darwin, right?

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,199
They do, and they're both pretty nerdy people.

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,819
This is a very nerdy university conversation that's happening between classes.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,379
Yeah, I think maybe they're like PhD candidates or something.

38
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:45,780
All right, so before we get to talking about some of the ideas in today's dialogue, let's talk about some of the words and phrases that we hear to understand better what's going on.

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,539
The first part we're going to talk about in today's Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,360
Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:02,259
All right, on Language Takeaway today, let's take a look at the first word and, well, one of the things that many people say is that Darwin revolutionized the fields of biology.

42
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,319
And so he revolutionized these because he pushed them forward.

43
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,860
He made many changes.

44
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,240
He forced changes.

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,139
So people had to change the way that they thought about these things.

46
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,819
If you revolutionize something, a topic or an idea, you are creating new knowledge almost, right?

47
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:18,240
Exactly.

48
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,319
You can think of the word revolution, which is a thing.

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,740
So you think of the Russian revolution or the American revolution.

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,199
These are times of change.

51
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,860
So to revolutionize is to bring about change.

52
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,560
Very good.

53
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,939
All right, so moving forward, they were talking about human evolution.

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,259
Human evolution.

55
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,539
What is that exactly?

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,360
Good question.

57
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,620
So you're not a monkey.

58
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,659
I'm not a monkey, but we come from monkeys, right?

59
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,620
So we evolved.

60
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:41,539
Right.

61
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:44,099
So the process is called human evolution.

62
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,580
That means the process by which humans changed forms to become what we are today.

63
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:49,840
Okay, so you evolve.

64
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,439
Now is it evolution?

65
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,340
You usually think of something positive, right?

66
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,560
Something evolves into something better.

67
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:56,479
Is it always that way?

68
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,659
No, we have another word for the negative, right?

69
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,759
So the positive is to evolve, to become better.

70
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,120
To get worse is to devolve.

71
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:06,659
Okay.

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,360
Yeah, to devolve, to go back and to kind of lose things that you had.

73
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,479
Okay, interesting.

74
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,920
And then they were also talking about Darwin's theory of natural selection.

75
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,000
Natural selection.

76
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:25,339
Okay, this is maybe one of the things that Darwin was most famous for, and that's why we've included it in this language takeaway, because it's a key phrase.

77
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,939
It's something you hear people talk about a lot.

78
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:37,980
Okay, so natural selection is a process, again, and it's the process by which stronger animals survive over time and weaker animals don't.

79
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:45,819
So if there's a weak species, it can't really survive because it keeps dying and dying, and then finally there's no more.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,839
And so this is called natural selection because no one's actually choosing what animals will survive, but it's kind of a natural process.

81
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,439
Right, Mother Nature is choosing it.

82
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,519
Very good.

83
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:56,860
So natural selection.

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,540
This is one of the things that Darwin is most famous for.

85
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,079
And well, as Catherine mentioned, Darwin wrote the book Origin of the Species.

86
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:06,879
Right.

87
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,540
So origin means beginning.

88
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,000
So the origin of mankind, right?

89
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,139
So there are many different kinds of animals.

90
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,139
You could even say there are many different kinds of like mammals, but there are many different species within that.

91
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,139
So human beings, black bears, koalas, chimpanzees, these are all species.

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,319
And so a species is a classification.

93
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,319
So the origin of the species is kind of a way of telling the story of how all these things came about.

94
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:32,920
All right.

95
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,360
The origin of the species.

96
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,319
And the last one, this word is kind of strange.

97
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,500
He talked about the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

98
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,579
Okay.

99
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,019
Conundrum.

100
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,199
I love this word.

101
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,680
It's very funny sounding.

102
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:45,480
Yeah, it is.

103
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:45,800
Conundrum.

104
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,139
It means like a problem or a riddle or something that's hard to understand.

105
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:50,899
All right.

106
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:54,439
So in this case, it's the conundrum of the chicken and the egg, right?

107
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,120
Which came first?

108
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,180
How else can you use conundrum?

109
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,019
You could say that maybe there's a situation that's very strange and hard to understand.

110
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,360
And this is quite a conundrum.

111
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,199
This is quite a conundrum we have.

112
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,139
So it sounds very fancy, very well educated.

113
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,740
It does.

114
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,459
All right.

115
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,819
So interesting words on language takeaway.

116
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,060
Why don't we move on now to four phrases on Fluency Builder.

117
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,220
Fluency Builder.

118
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,660
All right.

119
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,379
On Fluency Builder today, we have four phrases, as we said.

120
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:24,240
So what's the first one?

121
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,620
The first one is great.

122
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,740
It's very visual.

123
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,779
You say I'm up to my neck in work.

124
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:32,240
Well, I'm up to my neck in papers to write.

125
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,019
All right.

126
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:38,500
So this means I have so much stuff to do that you could pile it up and it would come up to my neck.

127
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,639
So I have as many papers that are almost as tall as I am.

128
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,319
Exactly.

129
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,060
And so I could say I'm up to my neck in work.

130
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,839
I have no more time to do anything.

131
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:53,959
Sometimes people also say I'm up to here and then they'll point at their forehead or somewhere around their head.

132
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,579
I'm up to here with your nonsense.

133
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,420
Exactly.

134
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,120
So this is a way of saying that I'm really busy.

135
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:00,980
Really busy.

136
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:01,980
I'm really tired of it.

137
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,639
All right.

138
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,579
And our next phrase is one that most mothers use.

139
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,079
I'm sick and tired.

140
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,319
I'm sick and tired of all of your whining.

141
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,620
Go do the dishes and don't complain.

142
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,040
Right.

143
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,000
So it's always it always goes together.

144
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,720
You are sick and tired.

145
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:18,079
Right.

146
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,019
And sick comes first.

147
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,500
So I'm sick and tired of this.

148
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,879
I'm sick and tired of your bad attitude.

149
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:23,540
OK.

150
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,240
So and that means that you are.

151
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm just tired of it.

152
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,860
I don't want you to have a bad attitude anymore.

153
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,360
I'm just.

154
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:29,899
Yeah.

155
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,180
I'm really annoyed by it.

156
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:31,759
I'm annoyed.

157
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,259
OK.

158
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,399
Sick and tired.

159
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,519
And then we saw a phrase that was a little bit separated.

160
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,439
He said the sentence went like this.

161
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,040
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

162
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,399
So to turn something on its head.

163
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,399
Like you said, Marco, it's split into two parts.

164
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,000
So he turned the field of computer science on its head.

165
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,360
So to turn on its head means to completely reverse something, to turn it around.

166
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,439
You think one hundred and eighty degrees.

167
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:03,800
And so if biology used to be one way, then Darwin made it completely different.

168
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:10,139
So we can say that Isaac Newton completely turned physics on its head with his theory or his findings on gravity.

169
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:19,800
And then years and years later, we had Albert Einstein, who turned those theories or who turned that theory on its head with his own ideas about physics.

170
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,439
Very good.

171
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:26,779
So to come to turn something on its head, to completely change the course of or prove something to be maybe wrong.

172
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:33,220
And the last phrase that we have is the person argued that Darwin's theories were full of holes.

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,259
OK, so to say a theory is full of holes is a little bit different than saying that his pants are full of holes, because when you say something is full of holes, maybe they actually have holes.

174
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,200
But a theory is it's an idea.

175
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,340
So it can't have holes.

176
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,379
What you're saying is that it's not completely sound.

177
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:51,720
It's not without some problems.

178
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:58,600
And so maybe you're saying that, well, the cookies are gone out of the kitchen, Marco, and I saw you in the kitchen.

179
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,240
So clearly you ate the cookies, right?

180
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,580
So I can say that's full of holes because it was me and it was three other people who were in the kitchen.

181
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,480
So you can't blame me.

182
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,399
It could have been the other two people, right?

183
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,100
So if something is full of holes, it's that it has maybe mistakes or it's still missing complete evidence to prove it right.

184
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,639
Or it has bad logic.

185
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,399
Bad logic.

186
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:17,820
All right.

187
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:18,600
Interesting.

188
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,440
So we've taken a look at a lot of words and different phrases here.

189
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,500
Let's listen to this argument one last time.

190
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,220
Where are you headed now?

191
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,879
I'm going to my anthro class.

192
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:56,220
We've been focusing on Darwin all term since it's the 200th anniversary of his birth or whatever.

193
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,340
I'm sick and tired of Darwin, Darwin, Darwin.

194
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,039
What?

195
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:00,779
Why?

196
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,399
How can you not like Darwin?

197
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,679
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

198
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,419
His theory of evolution revolutionized the fields of biology and anthropology.

199
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,940
I don't like him.

200
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,899
His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes.

201
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,200
It's not as solid as you make it out to be.

202
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,259
Say that again and you'll make enemies with half of the academy, not to mention your professors.

203
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:35,279
Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of the species and the process of natural selection constitutes a grand step towards a coherent understanding of the world and its very beginnings.

204
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,899
I'm not minimizing his huge contributions to science.

205
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,539
It's just that his theory reminds me of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

206
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,320
What are you talking about?

207
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,299
Which came first?

208
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:47,340
The chicken or the egg?

209
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,720
This is a classic logical problem, and I think it applies to Darwin's theory.

210
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,600
How did the very first living organism come to be?

211
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:55,879
Interesting.

212
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,679
I think that question is better suited for my philosophy class.

213
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,019
In the meantime, how about we settle this with a duel?

214
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,539
All right, we're back.

215
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:26,059
Interesting this Darwin's theories and his explanations for the origin of species and life as we know it, but there is the opposite to this, right?

216
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,279
There is a certain thing called creationism.

217
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:39,919
There is, and this is a big source of controversy, especially in the United States, because in some places, people want to teach creationism as well as evolution in schools, and so this is the big question.

218
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,879
Are they still equal as theories, or is one theory more proven than the other?

219
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:56,299
Right, and it is kind of hard to determine which one is better because one is based on faith, the other one is based more on scientific evidence, right?

220
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,019
So they're not really even on the same scale.

221
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,519
As we learned before, that's kind of like apples and oranges, right?

222
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:13,100
It is, and there are some people who would say that we have lots of ways of quote-unquote proving what happened in the past, but as long as we weren't there, we never really do know.

223
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,799
And there's always changes in science, so how can we be sure that what we know now isn't false?

224
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:20,340
Exactly.

225
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,139
Isn't misunderstanding.

226
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:28,700
Right, I think for now, this is the best explanation, but that doesn't mean that it's the correct one.

227
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,139
Maybe in 100 years from now, we'll have another explanation that's much better or maybe complementary to this one.

228
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,340
Well, we want to know what you guys think.

229
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,379
Come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

230
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,120
We really want to hear your opinions.

231
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,320
What do you think about this topic?

232
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,399
It is a little bit controversial, so we really look forward to your comments and any other questions you may have.

233
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:58,399
Yep, and just a reference, creationism is the idea that God created the world or a superior being created the world and that everything came from that, and so let us know what you think.

234
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,840
I am very curious, too.

235
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,259
And that's about it for today.

236
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:01,840
All right.

237
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,600
We'll see you guys there.

238
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:02,919
Bye-bye.
