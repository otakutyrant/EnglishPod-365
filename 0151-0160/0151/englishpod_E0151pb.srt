00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We have an advanced lesson for you today.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And my name is Catherine, and I'm very excited about this lesson, Marco.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's very interesting.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's about a very controversial topic and a very popular person in history, Charles Darwin.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So he's most famous, perhaps, for his book, The Origin of the Species.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And we're going to be talking a lot about science today, so put your thinking caps on.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
All right.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So without further ado, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm focusing on Darwin all term, since it's the 200th anniversary of his birth or whatever.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sick and tired of Darwin, Darwin, Darwin.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How can you not like Darwin?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
His theory of evolution revolutionized the fields of biology and anthropology.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't like him.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's not as solid as you make it out to be.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Say that again and you'll make enemies with half of the academy, not to mention your professors.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of the species and the process of natural selection constitutes a grand step towards a coherent understanding of the world and its very beginnings.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not minimizing his huge contributions to science.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's just that his theory reminds me of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is a classic logical problem and I think it applies to Darwin's theory.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How did the very first living organism come to be?

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Interesting.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I think that question is better suited for my philosophy class.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
In the meantime, how about we settle this with a duel?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All right, interesting.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They have very different views on Charles Darwin, right?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They do, and they're both pretty nerdy people.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is a very nerdy university conversation that's happening between classes.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, I think maybe they're like PhD candidates or something.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All right, so before we get to talking about some of the ideas in today's dialogue, let's talk about some of the words and phrases that we hear to understand better what's going on.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The first part we're going to talk about in today's Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
All right, on Language Takeaway today, let's take a look at the first word and, well, one of the things that many people say is that Darwin revolutionized the fields of biology.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And so he revolutionized these because he pushed them forward.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He made many changes.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He forced changes.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So people had to change the way that they thought about these things.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If you revolutionize something, a topic or an idea, you are creating new knowledge almost, right?

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Exactly.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You can think of the word revolution, which is a thing.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So you think of the Russian revolution or the American revolution.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
These are times of change.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So to revolutionize is to bring about change.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Very good.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
All right, so moving forward, they were talking about human evolution.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Human evolution.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What is that exactly?

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Good question.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So you're not a monkey.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm not a monkey, but we come from monkeys, right?

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So we evolved.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Right.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So the process is called human evolution.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That means the process by which humans changed forms to become what we are today.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, so you evolve.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now is it evolution?

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You usually think of something positive, right?

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Something evolves into something better.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is it always that way?

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No, we have another word for the negative, right?

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So the positive is to evolve, to become better.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
To get worse is to devolve.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, to devolve, to go back and to kind of lose things that you had.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay, interesting.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And then they were also talking about Darwin's theory of natural selection.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Natural selection.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, this is maybe one of the things that Darwin was most famous for, and that's why we've included it in this language takeaway, because it's a key phrase.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's something you hear people talk about a lot.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay, so natural selection is a process, again, and it's the process by which stronger animals survive over time and weaker animals don't.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So if there's a weak species, it can't really survive because it keeps dying and dying, and then finally there's no more.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And so this is called natural selection because no one's actually choosing what animals will survive, but it's kind of a natural process.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Right, Mother Nature is choosing it.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Very good.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So natural selection.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is one of the things that Darwin is most famous for.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And well, as Catherine mentioned, Darwin wrote the book Origin of the Species.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Right.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So origin means beginning.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So the origin of mankind, right?

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So there are many different kinds of animals.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You could even say there are many different kinds of like mammals, but there are many different species within that.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So human beings, black bears, koalas, chimpanzees, these are all species.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And so a species is a classification.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So the origin of the species is kind of a way of telling the story of how all these things came about.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
All right.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The origin of the species.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And the last one, this word is kind of strange.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He talked about the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Conundrum.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I love this word.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's very funny sounding.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, it is.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Conundrum.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It means like a problem or a riddle or something that's hard to understand.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
All right.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So in this case, it's the conundrum of the chicken and the egg, right?

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Which came first?

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How else can you use conundrum?

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You could say that maybe there's a situation that's very strange and hard to understand.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And this is quite a conundrum.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This is quite a conundrum we have.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So it sounds very fancy, very well educated.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It does.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All right.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So interesting words on language takeaway.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why don't we move on now to four phrases on Fluency Builder.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Fluency Builder.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
All right.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
On Fluency Builder today, we have four phrases, as we said.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So what's the first one?

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The first one is great.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's very visual.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You say I'm up to my neck in work.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, I'm up to my neck in papers to write.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
All right.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So this means I have so much stuff to do that you could pile it up and it would come up to my neck.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So I have as many papers that are almost as tall as I am.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Exactly.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And so I could say I'm up to my neck in work.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I have no more time to do anything.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Sometimes people also say I'm up to here and then they'll point at their forehead or somewhere around their head.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm up to here with your nonsense.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Exactly.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So this is a way of saying that I'm really busy.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Really busy.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm really tired of it.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
All right.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And our next phrase is one that most mothers use.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sick and tired.

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sick and tired of all of your whining.

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Go do the dishes and don't complain.

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Right.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So it's always it always goes together.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You are sick and tired.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Right.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And sick comes first.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So I'm sick and tired of this.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm sick and tired of your bad attitude.

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
OK.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So and that means that you are.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm just tired of it.

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't want you to have a bad attitude anymore.

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm just.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm really annoyed by it.

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm annoyed.

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
OK.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Sick and tired.

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then we saw a phrase that was a little bit separated.

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He said the sentence went like this.

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So to turn something on its head.

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Like you said, Marco, it's split into two parts.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So he turned the field of computer science on its head.

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So to turn on its head means to completely reverse something, to turn it around.

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You think one hundred and eighty degrees.

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And so if biology used to be one way, then Darwin made it completely different.

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So we can say that Isaac Newton completely turned physics on its head with his theory or his findings on gravity.

169
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And then years and years later, we had Albert Einstein, who turned those theories or who turned that theory on its head with his own ideas about physics.

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Very good.

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So to come to turn something on its head, to completely change the course of or prove something to be maybe wrong.

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And the last phrase that we have is the person argued that Darwin's theories were full of holes.

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
OK, so to say a theory is full of holes is a little bit different than saying that his pants are full of holes, because when you say something is full of holes, maybe they actually have holes.

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But a theory is it's an idea.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So it can't have holes.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What you're saying is that it's not completely sound.

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's not without some problems.

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And so maybe you're saying that, well, the cookies are gone out of the kitchen, Marco, and I saw you in the kitchen.

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So clearly you ate the cookies, right?

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So I can say that's full of holes because it was me and it was three other people who were in the kitchen.

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So you can't blame me.

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It could have been the other two people, right?

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So if something is full of holes, it's that it has maybe mistakes or it's still missing complete evidence to prove it right.

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Or it has bad logic.

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Bad logic.

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
All right.

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Interesting.

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of words and different phrases here.

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's listen to this argument one last time.

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Where are you headed now?

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm going to my anthro class.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We've been focusing on Darwin all term since it's the 200th anniversary of his birth or whatever.

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sick and tired of Darwin, Darwin, Darwin.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What?

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Why?

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How can you not like Darwin?

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
His theory of evolution revolutionized the fields of biology and anthropology.

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't like him.

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes.

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's not as solid as you make it out to be.

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Say that again and you'll make enemies with half of the academy, not to mention your professors.

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of the species and the process of natural selection constitutes a grand step towards a coherent understanding of the world and its very beginnings.

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm not minimizing his huge contributions to science.

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's just that his theory reminds me of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What are you talking about?

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Which came first?

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The chicken or the egg?

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is a classic logical problem, and I think it applies to Darwin's theory.

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
How did the very first living organism come to be?

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Interesting.

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I think that question is better suited for my philosophy class.

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
In the meantime, how about we settle this with a duel?

214
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
All right, we're back.

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Interesting this Darwin's theories and his explanations for the origin of species and life as we know it, but there is the opposite to this, right?

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There is a certain thing called creationism.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There is, and this is a big source of controversy, especially in the United States, because in some places, people want to teach creationism as well as evolution in schools, and so this is the big question.

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Are they still equal as theories, or is one theory more proven than the other?

219
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Right, and it is kind of hard to determine which one is better because one is based on faith, the other one is based more on scientific evidence, right?

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So they're not really even on the same scale.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
As we learned before, that's kind of like apples and oranges, right?

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It is, and there are some people who would say that we have lots of ways of quote-unquote proving what happened in the past, but as long as we weren't there, we never really do know.

223
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And there's always changes in science, so how can we be sure that what we know now isn't false?

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Exactly.

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Isn't misunderstanding.

226
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Right, I think for now, this is the best explanation, but that doesn't mean that it's the correct one.

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Maybe in 100 years from now, we'll have another explanation that's much better or maybe complementary to this one.

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, we want to know what you guys think.

229
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

230
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We really want to hear your opinions.

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What do you think about this topic?

232
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It is a little bit controversial, so we really look forward to your comments and any other questions you may have.

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yep, and just a reference, creationism is the idea that God created the world or a superior being created the world and that everything came from that, and so let us know what you think.

234
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I am very curious, too.

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And that's about it for today.

236
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
All right.

237
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We'll see you guys there.

238
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Bye-bye.
