00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:13,000
EnglishPod.com Steven, where have you been?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I, uh, there was an emergency at work, so...

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And you didn't even have the decency to call me.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's just that I- Yeah, right.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I've heard it all before.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is the fifth time you stood me up in two weeks.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You need to get your priorities straight.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Come on, Veronica.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's not fair.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I do care about you a lot, you know that.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I try to- You know what?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Maybe we should just take a break.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But, Veronica, would you listen to me?
