00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:13,560
EnglishPod.com Steven, where have you been?

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,600
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,120
I, uh, there was an emergency at work, so...

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,640
I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours.

5
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,940
And you didn't even have the decency to call me.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,160
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,000
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,659
It's just that I- Yeah, right.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,380
I've heard it all before.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,579
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,140
This is the fifth time you stood me up in two weeks.

12
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,439
You need to get your priorities straight.

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,460
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

14
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,159
Come on, Veronica.

15
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,200
That's not fair.

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,780
I do care about you a lot, you know that.

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,439
I try to- You know what?

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,460
Maybe we should just take a break.

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,899
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,179
But, Veronica, would you listen to me?
