00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're bringing you the third part of this series that we've created called I'm Sorry, I Love You.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right, the third part in our story about our EnglishPod couple.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, it's a romantic series, but today we're bringing you an argument.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Like in every relationship, you have fights, you have discussions, so we're going to teach you how to do that in English.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And in today's lesson, you'll learn some great language that people use when they get into an argument with their boyfriend or girlfriend.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Right, so why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We have one phrase today, get a hold.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Get a hold.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Get a hold.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
To get a hold.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
To get a hold of someone means?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Try and communicate with that person.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Exactly.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So to try and call that person.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
For example, I can say, I've been calling his phone all day, but I can't get a hold of him.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Or I could say, finally, Marco, I got a hold of you.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Where have you been all day?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Exactly.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now we're going to listen to our dialogue and as always, it's going to be at a normal pace, but you don't have to worry about it.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We'll come back and teach you all of the important words.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Steven, where have you been?

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I, uh, there was an emergency at work, so...

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours, and you didn't even have the decency to call me.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's just that I...

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, right.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I've heard it all before.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is the fifth time you stood me up in two weeks.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You need to get your priorities straight.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Come on, Veronica, that's not fair.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I do care about you a lot, you know that.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I try to...

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You know what?

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe we should just take a break.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But Veronica, would you listen to me?

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There was a fire alarm at my office building today, and I was...

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay, so a little bit of trouble in the relationship.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, that's too bad.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah, well, I think she's overreacting.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You do?

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We'll talk about that later on.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We saw some great words and phrases here, so it's time for language takeaway.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Language takeaway.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Today on language takeaway, we're bringing you three words.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The first word is stood me up.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Stood me up.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Stood me up.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Stood me up.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The phrase stand someone up, when do we use this?

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If for example you have a date and you don't go.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, so let's say you and I were supposed to have dinner together and you just didn't come and didn't call.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Right, so I stood you up.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Stand someone up.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Our next word, priorities.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Priorities.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Priorities.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So priorities are something that's really important in your life.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's right, like family or maybe work or making a lot of money or whatever it is.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What are your priorities in life?

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right, yeah.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay, and our last word for language takeaway, heading.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Heading.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Heading.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Heading.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is a bit of a funny verb, so let's listen to a couple of examples of how it's used so we can understand its meaning.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Example one.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know where our relationship is heading.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Example two.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Where is this bus heading?

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Example three.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Where is this project heading?

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So basically heading means going.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Exactly.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
A heading is where you're going.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yep.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, easy word and interesting.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay, so now it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's going to be slower so now we can understand the words that we just talked about.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Steven, where have you been?

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I, um, there was an emergency at work, so...

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours and you didn't even have the decency to call me.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's just that I...

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, right.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I've heard it all before.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is the fifth time you've stood me up in two weeks.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You need to get your priorities straight.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Come on, Veronica, that's not fair.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I do care about you a lot.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You know that.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I tried.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You know what?

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Maybe we should just take a break.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But, Veronica, would you just listen to me?

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There was a fire alarm at my office building today and I was stuck.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, now we saw some interesting phrases in dialogue.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, we saw some great phrases that people use when they're getting in a fight.

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Right.

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why don't we take a look at some of them in Fluency Builder?

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Fluency Builder.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The first phrase that I want to take a look at today is, Do you have any idea?

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you have any idea?

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you have any idea?

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is a great way to set up an argument.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So let's listen to some examples of how you would set up an argument using this phrase.

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Example 1.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You forgot my birthday.

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Do you have any idea how angry I am?

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Example 2.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Julie kissed my boyfriend.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Does she have any idea how mean that was?

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Example 3.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't you have any idea how sad I am?

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So it's a great phrase to make that person understand that you were really worried or...

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Really angry.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Really angry.

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay.

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And now the second phrase that we can take a look at is, I've heard it all before.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I heard it all before.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I've heard it all before.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I've heard it all before.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So this is a great phrase of just saying, You don't have to give me an excuse, I know what you're going to say.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Exactly.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And our last phrase today, Take a break.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Take a break.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Take a break.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So when a couple takes a break, they sort of stop their relationship, right?

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They're breaking up.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, but is it really like forever?

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Like a breakup that lasts forever?

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, maybe.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It could be forever, but they're saying, Let's just take some time away from each other for a couple of days or weeks.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And see what happens.

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Take a break.

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Take a break.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay, so our happy couple is going to take a break.

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, I guess they're not that happy then, hey?

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll come back and talk some more.

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Steven, where have you been?

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I, uh, there was an emergency at work, so...

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours, and you didn't even have the decency to call me.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's just that I...

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, right.

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I've heard it all before.

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This is the best time you stood me up in two weeks.

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You need to get your priorities straight.

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Come on, Veronica, that's not fair.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I do care about you a lot, you know that.

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I try to...

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You know what?

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Maybe we should just take a break.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But, Veronica, would you listen to me?

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There was a fire alarm at my office building today, and I was...

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So, Marco, this phrase, to take a break, really reminds me of a Friends episode.

181
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah, that really famous Friends episode when Ross and Rachel were on a break.

182
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And Ross, like, went with another girl, right?

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And then they definitely broke up after that.

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So that's one of the key issues, right?

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If you're taking a break, can you start to date someone else?

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah.

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I've got to agree with Rachel.

190
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Really?

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No, you can't.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You can't?

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So what's the point of taking a break?

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Just, you need some time away.

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You need some time to think.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But you're not really broken up.

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Exactly.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hmm.

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's convenient.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know.

202
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They were on a break.

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I agree with Ross.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, you would, wouldn't you?

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
All right, guys, we're out of time today.

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I hope you enjoyed our lesson, and be sure to listen next time because we will definitely have a part four to this.

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes.

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Coming out soon.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yep.

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And also come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave all your questions and comments.

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Marco and I are always happy to hear from you, and we love answering your questions.

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Right.

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And maybe you can tell us what you think happens in the fourth part.

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay.

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, until then, it's goodbye.

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Bye.

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Bye.

219
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Bye.

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Bye.
