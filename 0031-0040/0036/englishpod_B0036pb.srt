00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,859
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,620
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,700
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,880
And today we're bringing you the third part of this series that we've created called I'm Sorry, I Love You.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,140
That's right, the third part in our story about our EnglishPod couple.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,440
Yeah, it's a romantic series, but today we're bringing you an argument.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,359
That's right.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,899
Like in every relationship, you have fights, you have discussions, so we're going to teach you how to do that in English.

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:26,679
That's right.

10
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:35,159
And in today's lesson, you'll learn some great language that people use when they get into an argument with their boyfriend or girlfriend.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,600
Right, so why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,439
Vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:43,520
We have one phrase today, get a hold.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,679
Get a hold.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,460
Get a hold.

16
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,219
To get a hold.

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,280
To get a hold of someone means?

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,479
Try and communicate with that person.

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,399
Exactly.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,700
So to try and call that person.

21
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:01,799
For example, I can say, I've been calling his phone all day, but I can't get a hold of him.

22
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,480
Or I could say, finally, Marco, I got a hold of you.

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,700
Where have you been all day?

24
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:07,420
Exactly.

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,019
Now we're going to listen to our dialogue and as always, it's going to be at a normal pace, but you don't have to worry about it.

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,319
We'll come back and teach you all of the important words.

27
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:28,079
Steven, where have you been?

28
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,079
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

29
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,640
I, uh, there was an emergency at work, so...

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,480
I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours, and you didn't even have the decency to call me.

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,700
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

32
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,519
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

33
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:47,700
It's just that I...

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,200
Yeah, right.

35
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,939
I've heard it all before.

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,099
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

37
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,700
This is the fifth time you stood me up in two weeks.

38
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,959
You need to get your priorities straight.

39
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,019
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

40
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,739
Come on, Veronica, that's not fair.

41
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,299
I do care about you a lot, you know that.

42
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:08,740
I try to...

43
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:08,979
You know what?

44
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe we should just take a break.

45
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:14,419
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,759
But Veronica, would you listen to me?

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,419
There was a fire alarm at my office building today, and I was...

48
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,259
Okay, so a little bit of trouble in the relationship.

49
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,139
Yeah, that's too bad.

50
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,419
Yeah, well, I think she's overreacting.

51
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,139
You do?

52
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,960
We'll talk about that later on.

53
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,800
We saw some great words and phrases here, so it's time for language takeaway.

54
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,039
Language takeaway.

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,939
Today on language takeaway, we're bringing you three words.

56
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:54,280
The first word is stood me up.

57
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,000
Stood me up.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,620
Stood me up.

59
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,159
Stood me up.

60
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,539
The phrase stand someone up, when do we use this?

61
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,039
If for example you have a date and you don't go.

62
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:13,599
Okay, so let's say you and I were supposed to have dinner together and you just didn't come and didn't call.

63
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,780
Right, so I stood you up.

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,840
Stand someone up.

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,240
Our next word, priorities.

66
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,120
Priorities.

67
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,080
Priorities.

68
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,560
So priorities are something that's really important in your life.

69
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:32,780
That's right, like family or maybe work or making a lot of money or whatever it is.

70
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,460
What are your priorities in life?

71
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,379
Right, yeah.

72
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,300
Okay, and our last word for language takeaway, heading.

73
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:40,219
Heading.

74
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,340
Heading.

75
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,080
Heading.

76
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:50,360
This is a bit of a funny verb, so let's listen to a couple of examples of how it's used so we can understand its meaning.

77
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,840
Example one.

78
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,219
I don't know where our relationship is heading.

79
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,259
Example two.

80
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:06,860
Where is this bus heading?

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Example three.

82
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:15,219
Where is this project heading?

83
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,759
So basically heading means going.

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,819
Exactly.

85
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,540
A heading is where you're going.

86
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:22,920
Yep.

87
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,279
Okay, easy word and interesting.

88
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,560
Okay, so now it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time.

89
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,000
It's going to be slower so now we can understand the words that we just talked about.

90
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,519
Steven, where have you been?

91
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:46,620
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

92
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,519
I, um, there was an emergency at work, so...

93
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,699
I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours and you didn't even have the decency to call me.

94
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,339
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

95
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,980
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

96
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,959
It's just that I...

97
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,300
Yeah, right.

98
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,040
I've heard it all before.

99
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

100
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:19,459
This is the fifth time you've stood me up in two weeks.

101
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,720
You need to get your priorities straight.

102
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

103
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,540
Come on, Veronica, that's not fair.

104
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,300
I do care about you a lot.

105
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,540
You know that.

106
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,920
I tried.

107
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:37,519
You know what?

108
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,139
Maybe we should just take a break.

109
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,720
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

110
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,740
But, Veronica, would you just listen to me?

111
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,699
There was a fire alarm at my office building today and I was stuck.

112
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,860
Okay, now we saw some interesting phrases in dialogue.

113
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,279
Yeah, we saw some great phrases that people use when they're getting in a fight.

114
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,100
Right.

115
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:11,000
Why don't we take a look at some of them in Fluency Builder?

116
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,019
Fluency Builder.

117
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,259
The first phrase that I want to take a look at today is, Do you have any idea?

118
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,560
Do you have any idea?

119
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,519
Do you have any idea?

120
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,459
This is a great way to set up an argument.

121
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,779
So let's listen to some examples of how you would set up an argument using this phrase.

122
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,160
Example 1.

123
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,899
You forgot my birthday.

124
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,600
Do you have any idea how angry I am?

125
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,939
Example 2.

126
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,300
Julie kissed my boyfriend.

127
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,959
Does she have any idea how mean that was?

128
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,600
Example 3.

129
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:58,279
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

130
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,759
Don't you have any idea how sad I am?

131
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:08,439
So it's a great phrase to make that person understand that you were really worried or...

132
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:08,879
Really angry.

133
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,459
Really angry.

134
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,199
Yeah, yeah.

135
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:10,579
Okay.

136
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,519
And now the second phrase that we can take a look at is, I've heard it all before.

137
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:16,339
I heard it all before.

138
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,180
I've heard it all before.

139
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,800
I've heard it all before.

140
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:25,019
So this is a great phrase of just saying, You don't have to give me an excuse, I know what you're going to say.

141
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,839
Exactly.

142
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,680
And our last phrase today, Take a break.

143
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,980
Take a break.

144
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,220
Take a break.

145
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,620
So when a couple takes a break, they sort of stop their relationship, right?

146
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:38,519
They're breaking up.

147
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,860
Yeah, but is it really like forever?

148
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,000
Like a breakup that lasts forever?

149
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,360
Well, maybe.

150
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,519
It could be forever, but they're saying, Let's just take some time away from each other for a couple of days or weeks.

151
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,079
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,060
And see what happens.

153
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,500
Yes.

154
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:54,560
Take a break.

155
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,160
Take a break.

156
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:59,339
Okay, so our happy couple is going to take a break.

157
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,439
Well, I guess they're not that happy then, hey?

158
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,360
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll come back and talk some more.

159
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,360
Steven, where have you been?

160
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,319
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

161
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,939
I, uh, there was an emergency at work, so...

162
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:30,759
I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours, and you didn't even have the decency to call me.

163
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,940
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

164
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,759
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

165
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,960
It's just that I...

166
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,480
Yeah, right.

167
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,200
I've heard it all before.

168
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,360
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

169
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,940
This is the best time you stood me up in two weeks.

170
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:49,220
You need to get your priorities straight.

171
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,299
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

172
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,000
Come on, Veronica, that's not fair.

173
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,559
I do care about you a lot, you know that.

174
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,000
I try to...

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,259
You know what?

176
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,259
Maybe we should just take a break.

177
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,679
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

178
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,000
But, Veronica, would you listen to me?

179
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,400
There was a fire alarm at my office building today, and I was...

180
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:23,000
So, Marco, this phrase, to take a break, really reminds me of a Friends episode.

181
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,659
Yeah, that really famous Friends episode when Ross and Rachel were on a break.

182
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,659
And Ross, like, went with another girl, right?

183
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,220
And then they definitely broke up after that.

185
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:33,740
Yeah.

186
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,419
So that's one of the key issues, right?

187
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,860
If you're taking a break, can you start to date someone else?

188
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,379
Yeah.

189
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,799
I've got to agree with Rachel.

190
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,460
Really?

191
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:42,940
Yeah.

192
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:43,960
No, you can't.

193
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:44,840
You can't?

194
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,480
So what's the point of taking a break?

195
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,139
Just, you need some time away.

196
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,559
You need some time to think.

197
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,480
But you're not really broken up.

198
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:52,279
Exactly.

199
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:52,879
Hmm.

200
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,159
That's convenient.

201
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,220
I don't know.

202
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:56,299
They were on a break.

203
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,139
I agree with Ross.

204
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,860
Well, you would, wouldn't you?

205
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:01,299
All right, guys, we're out of time today.

206
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:07,320
I hope you enjoyed our lesson, and be sure to listen next time because we will definitely have a part four to this.

207
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:07,960
Yes.

208
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:08,759
Coming out soon.

209
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,000
Yep.

210
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:13,779
And also come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave all your questions and comments.

211
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,500
Yeah.

212
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,360
Marco and I are always happy to hear from you, and we love answering your questions.

213
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,000
Right.

214
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,980
And maybe you can tell us what you think happens in the fourth part.

215
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,279
Okay.

216
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,360
Well, until then, it's goodbye.

217
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:29,940
Bye.

218
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,019
Bye.

219
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:30,580
Bye.

220
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:31,460
Bye.
