00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,919
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,259
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:05,120
I'm joined here today with...

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,320
Erica.

5
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,259
And my name is Marco, and we're going to be looking at an office lesson today.

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,880
That's right.

7
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,800
We've got a lesson about describing somebody who's not such a good employee.

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:15,539
Right.

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,179
So we're going to be talking about how to describe this type of situation and a language for making your point.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:22,780
Yes.

11
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,460
So let's look at some vocabulary from the dialogue in Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,399
Vocabulary Preview.

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:31,039
So two words today.

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,100
The first one is a good fit.

15
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:35,359
A good fit.

16
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,479
A good fit.

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,539
A good fit.

18
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:43,299
So when we're talking about an employee and he's a good fit, it means he's suitable for the job.

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:43,820
Yes.

20
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,200
He's suitable for the job or for the company.

21
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,579
Or for the company, right?

22
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,539
So the opposite would be not a good fit.

23
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:51,060
Exactly.

24
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,619
The title of today's lesson.

25
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,320
Right.

26
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:57,920
And our last word for Vocabulary Preview, performance.

27
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:58,960
Performance.

28
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,179
Performance.

29
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,119
Your performance is...

30
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,400
How good or bad you do your job.

31
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,180
Right.

32
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,620
So you can have good performance or bad performance.

33
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,459
Just how well you do your job.

34
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:11,200
Perfect.

35
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:14,640
So now we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

36
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,060
And as always, it's going to be at a normal speed, but you don't have to worry about it.

37
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,900
Because we'll come back and explain all the key language.

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,000
Now we're going to listen as two managers discuss the performance of one employee.

39
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,959
So, Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative Jason Hundley.

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,680
Sure.

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,379
What's up?

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,859
Basically, I've got a few concerns about him.

43
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,959
And the bottom line is, I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

44
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,819
Okay.

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,560
What makes you say that?

46
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,379
I thought you were pleased with his overall performance.

47
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:58,159
Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?

48
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,060
Yeah, his attitude is great, but he's really unreliable.

49
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,200
Sometimes he's really productive, but then other times...

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,519
Take last Tuesday, for instance.

51
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,340
He was 45 minutes late for our morning meeting.

52
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,099
Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason.

53
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,439
But that's not the only thing.

54
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,840
You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic.

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,780
Yeah, but come on, Jeff.

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,219
As if you don't check Facebook at work.

58
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,060
Look, you hired this guy.

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,719
We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,919
So now it's up to you to coach him.

61
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,979
Make it work, Jeff.

62
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,580
Make it work, Jeff.

63
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,180
You would say that, wouldn't you?

64
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:44,139
He is your cousin.

65
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,020
You jerk.

66
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,500
Make me hire your stupid, useless cousin.

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,860
So apparently Lauren hired her cousin.

68
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:53,680
Yes.

69
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:56,840
That's always a complicated situation working with family members.

70
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,400
Yeah, it makes it really difficult for Jeff, doesn't it?

71
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,259
Yeah, and apparently Jeff isn't very happy.

72
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,259
Well, let's look at the language he used to tell us that he's unhappy about this.

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,539
Language takeaway OK, the first word on language takeaway today.

74
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,759
Unreliable.

75
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,360
Unreliable.

76
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:18,840
Unreliable.

77
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,569
Unreliable.

78
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,139
So let's listen to some examples of unreliable so then you can understand what it means.

79
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,919
Example one.

80
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,460
The trains here are so unreliable.

81
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,080
They never arrive on time.

82
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:38,419
Example two.

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,419
Thomas is pretty unreliable.

84
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,819
He never finishes his projects on time.

85
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,539
Example three.

86
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,560
You promised you would pick me up from work today.

87
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,500
You're so unreliable.

88
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,060
Unreliable.

89
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:05,599
We can understand that if someone is unreliable, we can't trust them to do their job, right?

90
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,060
Right, so you don't want to be unreliable.

91
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,780
The opposite would be?

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,439
Reliable.

93
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,020
Reliable.

94
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,219
You can trust them.

95
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,300
OK, our second word today.

96
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,259
Productive.

97
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,399
Productive.

98
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,319
Productive.

99
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,139
Productive.

100
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,740
When you're productive, it means that you accomplish your job, right?

101
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,720
You do a lot of work in a short amount of time.

102
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:25,500
Productive.

103
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,560
You want to be a productive employee.

104
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,279
Our third word, work ethic.

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,579
Work ethic.

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,860
Work ethic.

107
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,819
Work ethic.

108
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,319
So a person's work ethic is that person's attitude towards work.

109
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:48,540
Yes, if someone has a good work ethic, then they are always hard working and they come to work early and they finish their jobs on time and they stay and do lots of overtime.

110
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,540
So that's a good work ethic.

111
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,759
OK, great.

112
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,560
And our last word, coach.

113
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,800
When you coach an employee, you train them, right?

114
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,560
Yeah, you help that employee out by showing him or her how to do certain tasks.

115
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:08,980
Or how to do their job better.

116
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:09,439
Right.

117
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:13,800
So we've got some great language to describe work performance.

118
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,879
Let's listen to our dialogue a second time.

119
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,459
This time it'll be a little bit slower so you can understand these words and phrases a little bit more clearly.

120
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:36,939
So, Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative, Jason Huntley.

121
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,699
Sure.

122
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,800
What's up?

123
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,060
Basically, I've got a few concerns about him.

124
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,660
And the bottom line is I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

125
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,660
OK, what makes you say that?

126
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,500
I thought you were pleased with his overall performance.

127
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,459
Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?

128
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,060
Yeah, his attitude is great, but he's really unreliable.

129
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,139
Sometimes he's really productive, but then other times...

130
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,759
Take last Tuesday, for instance.

131
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,500
He was 45 minutes late for our morning meeting.

132
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,639
Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason.

133
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,500
But that's not the only thing.

134
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,399
You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic.

135
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:33,779
I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,720
Yeah, but come on, Jeff.

137
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,040
As if you don't check Facebook at work.

138
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,839
Look, you hired this guy.

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,600
We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

140
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,519
So now it's up to you to coach him.

141
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,339
Make it work, Jeff.

142
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,000
You would say that, wouldn't you?

143
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,300
He is your cousin.

144
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,279
What a jerk.

145
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,240
Make me hire your stupid, useless cousin.

146
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,860
Alright, so if you noticed, a lot of useful phrases have come up.

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

148
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,759
Fluency Builder.

149
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,240
Fluency Builder, today we have three phrases.

150
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,800
That's right, three phrases that will help us make our point better.

151
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:19,319
The first one is bottom line.

152
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:20,560
The bottom line.

153
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:21,860
The bottom line.

154
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,500
Let's listen to how this was used in the dialogue.

155
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,439
And the bottom line is I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

156
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,339
So basically it means...

157
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:41,699
Like the most important point.

158
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,220
The most important point, perfect.

159
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,579
The bottom line.

160
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,980
Our second word, overall.

161
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:48,839
Overall.

162
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,079
So this is the same as saying on the whole.

163
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,899
Right, the big picture, how you would say.

164
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:56,740
Yeah, in general.

165
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,639
In general.

166
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,220
So his overall performance is good.

167
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,279
It means in general...

168
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:02,699
His performance is good.

169
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,240
Perfect.

170
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,720
And our last phrase is very interesting because we can mix it up a little bit.

171
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,399
Perfectly good.

172
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,819
Perfectly good.

173
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,139
Perfectly good.

174
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,120
Perfectly good.

175
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:18,439
So this is an interesting phrase because you can describe different objects in this way.

176
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,819
Yeah, a perfectly good reason.

177
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,639
A perfectly good car.

178
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,279
A perfectly good computer.

179
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,939
So by the sounds of it, it's kind of like justifying.

180
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,579
Yeah, it's saying there's no problem with it.

181
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,480
There's no problem with it.

182
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,759
Why would you throw it away if it's a perfectly good computer?

183
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,539
Exactly.

184
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,139
Okay, perfectly good.

185
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,059
Okay, so now we can listen to our dialogue a third time at a normal speed.

186
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,460
And now we're ready to understand everything.

187
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:59,019
So, Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative, Jason Huntley.

188
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,399
Sure, what's up?

189
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,860
Basically, I've got a few concerns about him.

190
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,960
And the bottom line is, I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

191
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,600
Okay, what makes you say that?

192
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,039
I thought you were pleased with his overall performance.

193
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,179
Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?

194
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,120
Yeah, his attitude is great, but he's really unreliable.

195
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:25,539
Sometimes he's really productive, but then other times, take last Tuesday for instance.

196
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,399
He was 45 minutes late for our morning meeting.

197
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,120
Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason.

198
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,440
But that's not the only thing.

199
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,860
You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic.

200
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,500
I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

201
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,820
Yeah, but come on, Jeff.

202
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,240
As if you don't check Facebook at work.

203
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,080
Look, you hired this guy.

204
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,759
We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

205
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,960
So now it's up to you to coach him.

206
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,980
Make it work, Jeff.

207
00:09:58,379 --> 00:09:59,620
Make it work, Jeff.

208
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,200
You would say that, wouldn't you?

209
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,179
He is your cousin.

210
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,220
Jerk.

211
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,519
Make me your stupid, useless cousin.

212
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,139
Okay, I hope everyone enjoyed our lesson today.

213
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:11,960
Mm-hmm.

214
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,919
We've found some really useful vocabulary for a business situation.

215
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:15,659
Yes.

216
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:22,659

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,960

219
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,500
Right, so until then, it's goodbye.
