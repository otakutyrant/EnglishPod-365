00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm joined here today with...

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Erica.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And my name is Marco, and we're going to be looking at an office lesson today.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We've got a lesson about describing somebody who's not such a good employee.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Right.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we're going to be talking about how to describe this type of situation and a language for making your point.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So let's look at some vocabulary from the dialogue in Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Vocabulary Preview.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So two words today.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The first one is a good fit.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
A good fit.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
A good fit.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A good fit.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So when we're talking about an employee and he's a good fit, it means he's suitable for the job.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
He's suitable for the job or for the company.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Or for the company, right?

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So the opposite would be not a good fit.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Exactly.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The title of today's lesson.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Right.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And our last word for Vocabulary Preview, performance.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Performance.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Performance.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Your performance is...

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How good or bad you do your job.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Right.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So you can have good performance or bad performance.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Just how well you do your job.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Perfect.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So now we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And as always, it's going to be at a normal speed, but you don't have to worry about it.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because we'll come back and explain all the key language.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now we're going to listen as two managers discuss the performance of one employee.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative Jason Hundley.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sure.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's up?

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Basically, I've got a few concerns about him.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And the bottom line is, I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What makes you say that?

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I thought you were pleased with his overall performance.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, his attitude is great, but he's really unreliable.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sometimes he's really productive, but then other times...

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Take last Tuesday, for instance.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He was 45 minutes late for our morning meeting.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But that's not the only thing.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, but come on, Jeff.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
As if you don't check Facebook at work.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Look, you hired this guy.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So now it's up to you to coach him.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Make it work, Jeff.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Make it work, Jeff.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You would say that, wouldn't you?

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He is your cousin.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You jerk.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Make me hire your stupid, useless cousin.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So apparently Lauren hired her cousin.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's always a complicated situation working with family members.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, it makes it really difficult for Jeff, doesn't it?

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, and apparently Jeff isn't very happy.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, let's look at the language he used to tell us that he's unhappy about this.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Language takeaway OK, the first word on language takeaway today.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Unreliable.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Unreliable.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Unreliable.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Unreliable.

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So let's listen to some examples of unreliable so then you can understand what it means.

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Example one.

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The trains here are so unreliable.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They never arrive on time.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Example two.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Thomas is pretty unreliable.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He never finishes his projects on time.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Example three.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You promised you would pick me up from work today.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're so unreliable.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Unreliable.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We can understand that if someone is unreliable, we can't trust them to do their job, right?

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Right, so you don't want to be unreliable.

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The opposite would be?

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Reliable.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Reliable.

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You can trust them.

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
OK, our second word today.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Productive.

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Productive.

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Productive.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Productive.

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
When you're productive, it means that you accomplish your job, right?

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You do a lot of work in a short amount of time.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Productive.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You want to be a productive employee.

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Our third word, work ethic.

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Work ethic.

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Work ethic.

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Work ethic.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So a person's work ethic is that person's attitude towards work.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes, if someone has a good work ethic, then they are always hard working and they come to work early and they finish their jobs on time and they stay and do lots of overtime.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So that's a good work ethic.

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
OK, great.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And our last word, coach.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
When you coach an employee, you train them, right?

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, you help that employee out by showing him or her how to do certain tasks.

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Or how to do their job better.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Right.

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So we've got some great language to describe work performance.

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's listen to our dialogue a second time.

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This time it'll be a little bit slower so you can understand these words and phrases a little bit more clearly.

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So, Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative, Jason Huntley.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Sure.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What's up?

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Basically, I've got a few concerns about him.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And the bottom line is I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
OK, what makes you say that?

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I thought you were pleased with his overall performance.

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, his attitude is great, but he's really unreliable.

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Sometimes he's really productive, but then other times...

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Take last Tuesday, for instance.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He was 45 minutes late for our morning meeting.

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But that's not the only thing.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic.

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, but come on, Jeff.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
As if you don't check Facebook at work.

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Look, you hired this guy.

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So now it's up to you to coach him.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Make it work, Jeff.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You would say that, wouldn't you?

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He is your cousin.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What a jerk.

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Make me hire your stupid, useless cousin.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Alright, so if you noticed, a lot of useful phrases have come up.

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Fluency Builder.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Fluency Builder, today we have three phrases.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's right, three phrases that will help us make our point better.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The first one is bottom line.

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The bottom line.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The bottom line.

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's listen to how this was used in the dialogue.

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And the bottom line is I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So basically it means...

157
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Like the most important point.

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The most important point, perfect.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The bottom line.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Our second word, overall.

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Overall.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So this is the same as saying on the whole.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Right, the big picture, how you would say.

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah, in general.

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
In general.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So his overall performance is good.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It means in general...

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
His performance is good.

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Perfect.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And our last phrase is very interesting because we can mix it up a little bit.

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Perfectly good.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Perfectly good.

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Perfectly good.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Perfectly good.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So this is an interesting phrase because you can describe different objects in this way.

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, a perfectly good reason.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
A perfectly good car.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
A perfectly good computer.

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So by the sounds of it, it's kind of like justifying.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah, it's saying there's no problem with it.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There's no problem with it.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why would you throw it away if it's a perfectly good computer?

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Exactly.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay, perfectly good.

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay, so now we can listen to our dialogue a third time at a normal speed.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And now we're ready to understand everything.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So, Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative, Jason Huntley.

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sure, what's up?

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Basically, I've got a few concerns about him.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And the bottom line is, I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, what makes you say that?

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I thought you were pleased with his overall performance.

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, his attitude is great, but he's really unreliable.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Sometimes he's really productive, but then other times, take last Tuesday for instance.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He was 45 minutes late for our morning meeting.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But that's not the only thing.

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic.

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

201
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, but come on, Jeff.

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
As if you don't check Facebook at work.

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Look, you hired this guy.

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So now it's up to you to coach him.

206
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Make it work, Jeff.

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Make it work, Jeff.

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You would say that, wouldn't you?

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He is your cousin.

210
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Jerk.

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Make me your stupid, useless cousin.

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, I hope everyone enjoyed our lesson today.

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Mm-hmm.

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We've found some really useful vocabulary for a business situation.

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So go to our website at EnglishPod.com where you can leave all your questions and comments and also find a lot of other resources.

217

That's right.

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Marco and I are always on the site and we're happy to answer your questions.

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Right, so until then, it's goodbye.
