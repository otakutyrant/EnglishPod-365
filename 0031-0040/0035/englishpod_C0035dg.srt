EnglishPod.com So, Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative, Jason Huntley.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Sure, what's up?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Basically, I've got a few concerns about him.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And the bottom line is, I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, what makes you say that?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I thought you were pleased with his overall performance.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah, his attitude is great, but he's really unreliable.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Sometimes he's really productive, but then other times...

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Take last Tuesday, for instance.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He was 45 minutes late for our morning meeting.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But that's not the only thing.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, but come on, Jeff.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
As if you don't check Facebook at work.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Look, you hired this guy.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So now it's up to you to coach him.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Make it work, Jeff.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Make it work, Jeff.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You would say that, wouldn't you?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He is your cousin.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're a jerk.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Make me hire your stupid, useless cousin.
