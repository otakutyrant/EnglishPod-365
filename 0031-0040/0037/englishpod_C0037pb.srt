00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,859
Hello English learners, welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,660
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:05,719
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,199
And today we have a very special guest in our studio, Dainee.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,660
Hi everyone, I'm Dainee.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,660
Dainee is part of our EnglishPod team and today she's gonna help us with this Chinese New Year's lesson.

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,280
It's an intermediate lesson but it has a lot of cultural aspects about Chinese New Year.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,820
So that's what Dainee's gonna help us out with today.

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:33,679
Yes, today we're going to learn a little bit about Chinese New Year in English and we're also going to learn some language for describing things that we're excited about.

10
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:36,039
Okay, yeah, I'm excited to hear the show.

11
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,299
Okay, so let's listen to the dialogue now and then when we come back we'll explain everything.

12
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:50,299
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year.

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,179
When do I get to visit Grandma?

14
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,380
Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world.

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:00,020
Haha, right, sounds to me like you're more excited about dumplings than seeing your grandma.

16
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,159
Of course I miss Grandma too, I bet she's gonna teach me how to play mahjong.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,340
Hey, Dad, are you gonna buy me firecrackers this year?

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,000
We're gonna have the best fireworks.

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,099
I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

20
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,019
Son, firecrackers aren't toys, they're dangerous.

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,379
No, fireworks are awesome.

22
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,760
Wow, don't you remember?

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,780
Last year when I set off the firecrackers, you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,459
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug, that's all.

25
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:30,799
Really?

26
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,260
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,680
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,420
Hey, I offered last year.

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,920
Well, anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

30
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:45,200
I want to make a list of all the things I'm gonna buy with my red envelope money.

31
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,599
I can't wait, I'm gonna have so much money.

32
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,000
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

33
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,719
I want a new transformer, no, two transformers.

34
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,659
I'll have a surprise, a wheel jack, I'll get a PSP game.

35
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:11,740
Okay, so Chinese New Year, a lot of exciting vocabulary here.

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,159
Before we get into describing it, let's look at the vocabulary that we saw.

37
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,340
In language takeaway.

38
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,780
The first word on language takeaway, dumplings.

39
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:24,759
Dumplings.

40
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:25,879
Dumplings.

41
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:26,680
Dumplings.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,620
Well, in Chinese, we call it shui jiao.

43
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:34,340
And it's a very traditional Chinese food and it's getting very famous now.

44
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:41,219
Yes, so it's basically small pieces of dough with maybe some meat or some vegetables inside.

45
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,960
And then they are boiled.

46
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:43,960
Usually in a soup.

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,719
In a soup.

48
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,180
But you can also have fried dumplings, which are really good.

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,680
So if you know Italian food, they're really similar to a tortellini.

50
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,719
Not exactly.

51
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:57,719
Or in Latin America, it's very similar to maybe an empanada.

52
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,000
It's like a small little empanada.

53
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,319
Marco, what's our next word?

54
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,900
Alright, our next word, firecrackers.

55
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:06,280
Firecrackers.

56
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,819
Firecrackers.

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,680
Firecrackers.

58
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,259
This is a firecracker.

59
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,039
Firecrackers.

60
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:20,780
Firecrackers are so common in China.

61
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,979
We use it all the time in all occasions.

62
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:30,080
And especially on the New Year's Eve, traditionally people use it to scare off the evil.

63
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,020
Evil spirits.

64
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,000
The evil spirits.

65
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,099
Okay.

66
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,620
So on Chinese New Year, there are millions of firecrackers.

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,819
Millions of firecrackers.

68
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,020
Now, there are also a lot of fireworks.

69
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,099
Fireworks.

70
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,479
Fireworks.

71
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,199
Fireworks.

72
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,680
So fireworks are similar to firecrackers.

73
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,960
But they have lots of light.

74
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:50,800
Yeah.

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,120
They go up in the air and explode and you see lots of nice colors.

76
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,060
Beautiful colors.

77
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:56,360
Yeah.

78
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,400
Very popular in 4th of July in the United States.

79
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,280
Or New Year's Eve.

80
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,020
New Year's Eve.

81
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,759
Fireworks.

82
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:03,780
Okay.

83
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,939
Now let's look at our last word, set off.

84
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,319
Set off.

85
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,439
Set off.

86
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,400
Set off.

87
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,240
So this is the verb you would use with firecrackers.

88
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,580
Yeah.

89
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,580
It means like explode the firecracker.

90
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,319
Set off the firecracker.

91
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,519
Set off the bomb.

92
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,699
Set off fireworks.

93
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,300
Well, let's listen to our dialogue a second time.

94
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,660
And this time it'll be a little bit slower so that you can understand the language a bit better.

95
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,199
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year.

96
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,459
When do I get to visit Grandma?

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,540
Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world.

98
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,379
Haha.

99
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:43,300
Right.

100
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,420
Sounds to me like you are more excited about dumplings than seeing your grandma.

101
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,279
Of course I miss grandma too.

102
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,439
I bet she's going to teach me how to play mahjong.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,560
Hey, dad, are you going to buy me firecrackers this year?

104
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,839
We're going to have the best fireworks.

105
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,560
I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

106
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:07,480
Son, firecrackers aren't toys.

107
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,800
They're dangerous.

108
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,040
No.

109
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,540
Fireworks are awesome.

110
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,639
Whoa.

111
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,839
Don't you remember?

112
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,439
Last year when I set off the firecrackers, you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother.

113
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,660
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug.

114
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,360
That's all.

115
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:26,939
Haha.

116
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:27,779
Really?

117
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,220
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

118
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,779
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

119
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,199
Hey, I offered last year.

120
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,360
Well, I...

121
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,759
Anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

122
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,279
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red envelope money.

123
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,420
I can't wait.

124
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,139
I'm going to have so much money.

125
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,839
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

126
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,879
I want a new transformer.

127
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,819
No, two transformers.

128
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,319
The Optimus Prime and maybe the Wheeljack.

129
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,899
I'll get a PSP game.

130
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,639
Haha.

131
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,480
And I'll buy the entire class lunch at McDonald's.

132
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,459
Okay, so we saw some really great phrases of describing excitement, right?

133
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,860
So let's start with fluency builder.

134
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,000
Fluency builder.

135
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,860
We have four phrases for you today.

136
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,319
And the first one is, I'm so excited about.

137
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,379
I'm so excited about.

138
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,920
I'm so excited about.

139
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,439
So when you say, I'm so excited, it means that you are...

140
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,459
Like really happy.

141
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,860
That something is going to happen.

142
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,680
Yeah, so happy you can't relax.

143
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,800
Right, so you could say, I'm so excited about our vacation next month.

144
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,220
I'm so excited about opening all my presents.

145
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,560
Exactly, so excited.

146
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,860
Now we also saw another really great word, very similar to I'm so excited.

147
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,199
Yeah.

148
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,660
I'm really looking forward to.

149
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,980
I'm really looking forward to.

150
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,180
I'm really looking forward to.

151
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,959
I'm really looking forward to.

152
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,279
So this is a little bit less than excited, right?

153
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:00,279
A bit less strong.

154
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,959
So you would say, oh, I'm really looking forward to meeting your new girlfriend.

155
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,920
Or you can say, I'm really looking forward to seeing that movie.

156
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:14,360
Exactly, so it means you're a little bit excited, but not so excited.

157
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,360
Yeah, you're happy about something that's going to happen in the future.

158
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:21,279
Now let's look at our next phrase, and it's very similar to excited.

159
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,060
I can't wait.

160
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,439
I can't wait.

161
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't wait.

162
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,819
I can't wait.

163
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,000
So this is very, very similar to I'm so excited.

164
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:33,259
Yes, when you're so excited for something, you can't wait for it.

165
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,220
Let's listen to some more examples of I can't wait.

166
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,339
Example one.

167
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,220
I'm so excited, I can't wait to see you.

168
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,199
Example two.

169
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,019
Smells delicious, I can't wait for dinner.

170
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:00,819
Example three.

171
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,500
I can't wait to open my presents.

172
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:14,620
So we can use it again the same way, I can't wait to go on vacation next month.

173
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,639
I can't wait to open all my presents.

174
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,860
Now our last phrase, I bet.

175
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,000
I bet.

176
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,339
I bet.

177
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,339
I bet.

178
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,139
B-E-T, bet.

179
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:25,740
Bet.

180
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,759
So when you say I bet, it means that you're pretty sure about something.

181
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,659
You predict it will happen.

182
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,460
Right, so let's listen to some more examples of I bet.

183
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,519
Example one.

184
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,179
I bet I'm going to get so much money for Chinese New Year.

185
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,220
Example two.

186
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,320
Robert Slade, where do you think he is?

187
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,200
I bet he's stuck in traffic.

188
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,240
Example three.

189
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,080
I bet the boss is going to give us a big bonus this year.

190
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Well I guess we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the third time, and then when we come back, Danny's going to tell us all about Chinese New Year.

191
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:27,559
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year.

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,379
When do I get to visit Grandma?

193
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,580
Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world.

194
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,299
Haha, right, sounds to me like you're more excited about dumplings than seeing your Grandma.

195
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,279
Of course I miss Grandma too.

196
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,379
I bet she's going to teach me how to play mahjong.

197
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,559
Hey, Dad, are you going to buy me firecrackers this year?

198
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,240
We're going to have the best fireworks.

199
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,259
I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

200
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,200
Son, firecrackers are the best.

201
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,279
Owned toys, they are dangerous.

202
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,580
No, fireworks are awesome.

203
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,980
Wow, don't you remember?

204
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,000
Last year when I set out the firecrackers, you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother.

205
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,659
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug, that's all.

206
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,080
Haha, really?

207
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,500
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,879
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

209
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,659
Hey, I offered last year.

210
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,139
Well I, anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

211
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,419
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red envelope money.

212
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,340
I can't wait.

213
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:24,820
I'm going to have so much money.

214
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,200
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

215
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
I want a new transformer.

216
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:29,960
No, two transformers.

217
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,759
Optimus Prime.

218
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,559
Wheeljack.

219
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,840
I'll get a PSP game.

220
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,379
Oh, I need hair.

221
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,639
So Dainee, what are these red packets of money about?

222
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:56,440
So in Chinese we call it hong bao, and it's basically a bag full of money.

223
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:57,820
Why do you get money?

224
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,799
As a gift.

225
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,559
As a gift?

226
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,120
Yeah.

227
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,980
Do children get it though?

228
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,039
Only children get it.

229
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:12,299
If you're a university student and you haven't got a job yet, then you can still ask for hong bao from your parents or your relatives.

230
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:16,259
So is there some meaning to this gift of money?

231
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:26,720
Well, it is believed that children have to put these red envelopes under their pillow on New Year's Eve to scare away the evil spirits, again like the firecrackers.

232
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,960
A lot of evil spirits in China.

233
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,600
So Dainee, how much money would a kid get for Chinese New Year?

234
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:39,340
Well, when I was little, the best year I got was 3,000 RMB.

235
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,440
Which is like almost...

236
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,539
$500.

237
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:42,419
Wow.

238
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,240
Almost $500.

239
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,940
I was so rich at the time.

240
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:47,899
Wow, amazing.

241
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,860
What about this game, mahjong?

242
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:51,720
Mahjong?

243
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,419
Mahjong.

244
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,379
Have you played it?

245
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:53,639
No.

246
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,059
No.

247
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:03,659
Again, it's a very traditional Chinese game and you will see senior people always gathering along the table.

248
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,600
So old people.

249
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,360
Old people.

250
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,159
So it's like a board game, kind of like chess?

251
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,320
It's kind of like chess but they have specially made chess.

252
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,460
It's very different.

253
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,539
So I want to know more about the fireworks and firecrackers on Chinese New Year.

254
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
Okay, usually we buy firecrackers.

255
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,919
Yes.

256
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,039
I believe fireworks are more expensive so we play firecrackers, pao zhang.

257
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:33,559
And usually we do it right after midnight, so 12 o'clock.

258
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:44,840
It's very loud and say for example, I personally don't even dare to stay close when they set off the firecrackers because it's just way too loud.

259
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,320
And everyone starts to like them so it's like...

260
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,240
No, it's amazing.

261
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:49,799
It's shitty.

262
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,600
I've seen Chinese New Year three times in China and each time I've just been amazed.

263
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,639
It's so cool and so noisy and so awesome.

264
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,580
I mean you've got to visit China to see this.

265
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,220
Yeah, it's a really cool festival.

266
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,159
And definitely playing with firecrackers is always fun.

267
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,039
Yeah.

268
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,340
Maybe a little bit dangerous.

269
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:16,720
Well everyone, we've just learned about how New Year's is celebrated in China and we want to know how do you celebrate New Year's in your country?

270
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,399
Exactly.

271
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,100
How do you welcome the New Year?

272
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,840
How do you scare away evil spirits?

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,759
