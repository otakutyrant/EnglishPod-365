00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello English learners, welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we have a very special guest in our studio, Dainee.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi everyone, I'm Dainee.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Dainee is part of our EnglishPod team and today she's gonna help us with this Chinese New Year's lesson.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's an intermediate lesson but it has a lot of cultural aspects about Chinese New Year.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So that's what Dainee's gonna help us out with today.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, today we're going to learn a little bit about Chinese New Year in English and we're also going to learn some language for describing things that we're excited about.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, yeah, I'm excited to hear the show.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, so let's listen to the dialogue now and then when we come back we'll explain everything.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When do I get to visit Grandma?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Haha, right, sounds to me like you're more excited about dumplings than seeing your grandma.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Of course I miss Grandma too, I bet she's gonna teach me how to play mahjong.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hey, Dad, are you gonna buy me firecrackers this year?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We're gonna have the best fireworks.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Son, firecrackers aren't toys, they're dangerous.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, fireworks are awesome.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Wow, don't you remember?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Last year when I set off the firecrackers, you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug, that's all.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Really?

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hey, I offered last year.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want to make a list of all the things I'm gonna buy with my red envelope money.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I can't wait, I'm gonna have so much money.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want a new transformer, no, two transformers.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll have a surprise, a wheel jack, I'll get a PSP game.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay, so Chinese New Year, a lot of exciting vocabulary here.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Before we get into describing it, let's look at the vocabulary that we saw.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
In language takeaway.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The first word on language takeaway, dumplings.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Dumplings.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Dumplings.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Dumplings.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, in Chinese, we call it shui jiao.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And it's a very traditional Chinese food and it's getting very famous now.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes, so it's basically small pieces of dough with maybe some meat or some vegetables inside.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And then they are boiled.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Usually in a soup.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In a soup.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But you can also have fried dumplings, which are really good.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So if you know Italian food, they're really similar to a tortellini.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Not exactly.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Or in Latin America, it's very similar to maybe an empanada.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's like a small little empanada.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Marco, what's our next word?

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Alright, our next word, firecrackers.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Firecrackers.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Firecrackers.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Firecrackers.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is a firecracker.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Firecrackers.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Firecrackers are so common in China.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We use it all the time in all occasions.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And especially on the New Year's Eve, traditionally people use it to scare off the evil.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Evil spirits.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The evil spirits.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So on Chinese New Year, there are millions of firecrackers.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Millions of firecrackers.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Now, there are also a lot of fireworks.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Fireworks.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Fireworks.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Fireworks.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So fireworks are similar to firecrackers.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But they have lots of light.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They go up in the air and explode and you see lots of nice colors.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Beautiful colors.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Very popular in 4th of July in the United States.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Or New Year's Eve.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
New Year's Eve.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Fireworks.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now let's look at our last word, set off.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Set off.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Set off.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Set off.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So this is the verb you would use with firecrackers.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It means like explode the firecracker.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Set off the firecracker.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Set off the bomb.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Set off fireworks.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, let's listen to our dialogue a second time.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And this time it'll be a little bit slower so that you can understand the language a bit better.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
When do I get to visit Grandma?

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Haha.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Right.

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Sounds to me like you are more excited about dumplings than seeing your grandma.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Of course I miss grandma too.

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I bet she's going to teach me how to play mahjong.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hey, dad, are you going to buy me firecrackers this year?

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We're going to have the best fireworks.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Son, firecrackers aren't toys.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They're dangerous.

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Fireworks are awesome.

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Whoa.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't you remember?

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Last year when I set off the firecrackers, you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug.

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's all.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Haha.

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Really?

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hey, I offered last year.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Well, I...

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red envelope money.

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I can't wait.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm going to have so much money.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I want a new transformer.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No, two transformers.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The Optimus Prime and maybe the Wheeljack.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll get a PSP game.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Haha.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And I'll buy the entire class lunch at McDonald's.

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay, so we saw some really great phrases of describing excitement, right?

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So let's start with fluency builder.

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Fluency builder.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We have four phrases for you today.

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And the first one is, I'm so excited about.

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm so excited about.

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm so excited about.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So when you say, I'm so excited, it means that you are...

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Like really happy.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That something is going to happen.

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, so happy you can't relax.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Right, so you could say, I'm so excited about our vacation next month.

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm so excited about opening all my presents.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Exactly, so excited.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Now we also saw another really great word, very similar to I'm so excited.

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah.

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm really looking forward to.

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm really looking forward to.

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm really looking forward to.

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm really looking forward to.

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So this is a little bit less than excited, right?

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
A bit less strong.

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So you would say, oh, I'm really looking forward to meeting your new girlfriend.

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Or you can say, I'm really looking forward to seeing that movie.

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Exactly, so it means you're a little bit excited, but not so excited.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah, you're happy about something that's going to happen in the future.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now let's look at our next phrase, and it's very similar to excited.

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can't wait.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't wait.

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't wait.

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't wait.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So this is very, very similar to I'm so excited.

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes, when you're so excited for something, you can't wait for it.

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's listen to some more examples of I can't wait.

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Example one.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm so excited, I can't wait to see you.

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Example two.

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Smells delicious, I can't wait for dinner.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Example three.

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can't wait to open my presents.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So we can use it again the same way, I can't wait to go on vacation next month.

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I can't wait to open all my presents.

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Now our last phrase, I bet.

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I bet.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I bet.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I bet.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
B-E-T, bet.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Bet.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So when you say I bet, it means that you're pretty sure about something.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You predict it will happen.

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Right, so let's listen to some more examples of I bet.

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Example one.

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I bet I'm going to get so much money for Chinese New Year.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Example two.

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Robert Slade, where do you think he is?

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I bet he's stuck in traffic.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Example three.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I bet the boss is going to give us a big bonus this year.

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Well I guess we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the third time, and then when we come back, Danny's going to tell us all about Chinese New Year.

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year.

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
When do I get to visit Grandma?

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world.

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Haha, right, sounds to me like you're more excited about dumplings than seeing your Grandma.

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Of course I miss Grandma too.

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I bet she's going to teach me how to play mahjong.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Hey, Dad, are you going to buy me firecrackers this year?

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We're going to have the best fireworks.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Son, firecrackers are the best.

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Owned toys, they are dangerous.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No, fireworks are awesome.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Wow, don't you remember?

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Last year when I set out the firecrackers, you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother.

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug, that's all.

206
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Haha, really?

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hey, I offered last year.

210
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Well I, anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red envelope money.

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can't wait.

213
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm going to have so much money.

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

215
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I want a new transformer.

216
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No, two transformers.

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Optimus Prime.

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Wheeljack.

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll get a PSP game.

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh, I need hair.

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So Dainee, what are these red packets of money about?

222
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So in Chinese we call it hong bao, and it's basically a bag full of money.

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Why do you get money?

224
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
As a gift.

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
As a gift?

226
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Do children get it though?

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Only children get it.

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If you're a university student and you haven't got a job yet, then you can still ask for hong bao from your parents or your relatives.

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So is there some meaning to this gift of money?

231
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, it is believed that children have to put these red envelopes under their pillow on New Year's Eve to scare away the evil spirits, again like the firecrackers.

232
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
A lot of evil spirits in China.

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So Dainee, how much money would a kid get for Chinese New Year?

234
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, when I was little, the best year I got was 3,000 RMB.

235
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Which is like almost...

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
$500.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Wow.

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Almost $500.

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was so rich at the time.

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Wow, amazing.

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What about this game, mahjong?

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Mahjong?

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Mahjong.

244
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Have you played it?

245
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No.

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No.

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Again, it's a very traditional Chinese game and you will see senior people always gathering along the table.

248
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So old people.

249
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Old people.

250
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So it's like a board game, kind of like chess?

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's kind of like chess but they have specially made chess.

252
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's very different.

253
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So I want to know more about the fireworks and firecrackers on Chinese New Year.

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay, usually we buy firecrackers.

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes.

256
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I believe fireworks are more expensive so we play firecrackers, pao zhang.

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And usually we do it right after midnight, so 12 o'clock.

258
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's very loud and say for example, I personally don't even dare to stay close when they set off the firecrackers because it's just way too loud.

259
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And everyone starts to like them so it's like...

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
No, it's amazing.

261
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's shitty.

262
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I've seen Chinese New Year three times in China and each time I've just been amazed.

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's so cool and so noisy and so awesome.

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I mean you've got to visit China to see this.

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah, it's a really cool festival.

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And definitely playing with firecrackers is always fun.

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah.

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Maybe a little bit dangerous.

269
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well everyone, we've just learned about how New Year's is celebrated in China and we want to know how do you celebrate New Year's in your country?

270
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Exactly.

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
How do you welcome the New Year?

272
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
How do you scare away evil spirits?

273
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
