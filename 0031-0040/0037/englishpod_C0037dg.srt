00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:31,000
EnglishPod.com I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Son, firecrackers aren't toys, they are dangerous.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No, fireworks are awesome.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Wow, don't you remember?

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Last year when I set off the firecrackers, you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug, that's all.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Haha, really?

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey, I offered last year.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red envelope money.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't wait.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to have so much money.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want a new transformer.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, two transformers.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Optimus Prime.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Wheeljack.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll get a PSP game.
