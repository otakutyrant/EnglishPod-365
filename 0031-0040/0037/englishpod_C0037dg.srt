00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:31,539
EnglishPod.com I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

2
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,460
Son, firecrackers aren't toys, they are dangerous.

3
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,799
No, fireworks are awesome.

4
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:40,200
Wow, don't you remember?

5
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,200
Last year when I set off the firecrackers, you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,859
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug, that's all.

7
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,280
Haha, really?

8
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,700
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

9
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,100
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

10
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,859
Hey, I offered last year.

11
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,340
Well, anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

12
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,599
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red envelope money.

13
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,540
I can't wait.

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to have so much money.

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,400
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

16
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,040
I want a new transformer.

17
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,140
No, two transformers.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:13,959
Optimus Prime.

19
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:14,780
Wheeljack.

20
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,040
I'll get a PSP game.
