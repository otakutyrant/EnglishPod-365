EnglishPod.com Hi there, can I help you folks?

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,760
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

3
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,660
My daughter wants a car for her birthday, you know how it is.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,440
Dad!

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,579
I'm 16 already, and I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

6
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:26,820
She's right, you know.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,500
Kids these days all have cars.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,199
Let me show you something we just got in.

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,299
A 1996 sedan, excellent gas mileage.

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,399
It has dual airbags and anti-light brakes, a perfect vehicle for a young driver.

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,079
Dad, I love it!

12
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:39,920
It's awesome!

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,859
Can we get this one please?

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,939
I see, what can you tell me about this one?

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,039
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,479
Now about this sedan...

17
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,740
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

18
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,380
Tell me more about this tank.

19
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:01,579
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

20
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,319
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short-range missile attacks.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,140
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:10,939
It does not.

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,620
Well, I don't know.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,920
Let me sleep on it.

25
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,260
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,219
I'll take it!

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,019
Dad!
