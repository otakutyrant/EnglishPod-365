EnglishPod.com Hi there, can I help you folks?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
My daughter wants a car for her birthday, you know how it is.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Dad!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm 16 already, and I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
She's right, you know.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Kids these days all have cars.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let me show you something we just got in.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A 1996 sedan, excellent gas mileage.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It has dual airbags and anti-light brakes, a perfect vehicle for a young driver.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Dad, I love it!

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's awesome!

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Can we get this one please?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I see, what can you tell me about this one?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now about this sedan...

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tell me more about this tank.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short-range missile attacks.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It does not.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, I don't know.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let me sleep on it.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll take it!

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Dad!
