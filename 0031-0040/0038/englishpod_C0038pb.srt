00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're bringing you another great lesson for all of you who are interested in shopping.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Especially those of you who are interested in shopping for a car.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A car, exactly.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So we're going to give you some great language about describing a car or characteristics of a car.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yep.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And also some really interesting language for shopping.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes, especially buying something really big and expensive.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, like a car.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yep.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So before we listen to our dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
On vocabulary preview today, we're bringing you two words.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The first one is vehicle.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Vehicle.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Vehicle.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Vehicle.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So again, a vehicle is a machine, right?

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Right, a machine that carries people from one place to another.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So it's important to say that a vehicle could be an airplane, a car, a car, a boat, a boat, even a bicycle.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Right.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yep.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's a vehicle.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Our second word is sedan.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sedan.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sedan.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Sedan.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So a sedan is a type of car.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Exactly.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's a type of car with four doors that can fit five people inside.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So to make it more clear, most taxis are sedans.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Exactly.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Right?

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yep.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They have four doors, five people can fit in there including the driver, except taxis in Mexico.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They're not sedans?

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They're little beetles.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They're Volkswagen beetles, so those are not sedans.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But yeah, most countries have sedans as taxis.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
To give you some examples, like a Toyota Corolla or a Toyota Camry is a sedan.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Maybe like a Volkswagen Jetta.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Is that a...

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A Jetta?

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, a Jetta is a sedan.

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yep.

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now we can listen to our dialogue, and it's going to be at a normal speed the first time, but you don't have to worry about it.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We'll come back and teach you some of the important words from the dialogue.

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hi there.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Can I help you folks?

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
My daughter wants a car for her birthday.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You know how it is.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Dad, I'm 16 already, and I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She's right, you know.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Kids these days all have cars.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let me show you something we just got in.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
A 1996 sedan.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Excellent gas mileage.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It has dual airbags and anti-light brakes.

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A perfect vehicle for a young driver.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Dad, I love it.

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's awesome.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Can we get this one, please?

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I see.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What can you tell me about this one?

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now about this sedan.

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tell me more about this tank.

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short-range missile attacks.

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It does not.

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, I don't know.

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let me sleep on it.

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll take it.

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Dad!

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think she's really lucky.

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Really?

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
She's getting a tank to go to school.

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How awesome is that?

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I would be so embarrassed if I had to drive to school in a tank.

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's like the coolest car.

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh, you're such a boy.

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Alright, a surprising ending to a relatively easy shopping day.

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah.

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's take a look at some language that we saw in our dialogue on Language Takeaway.

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Language Takeaway.

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We have four words for you today.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The first one is gas mileage.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Gas mileage.

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Gas mileage.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Gas mileage.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So gas mileage is how many miles you can travel on a gallon or liter of gasoline.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, you know what's interesting?

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In some English-speaking countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, we use kilometers to measure distance, but we still talk about gas mileage.

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I guess you can't say gas kilo-mileage.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But yeah, it's basically how many kilometers or how many miles you can travel on a tank or on a liter or gallon of gas.

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Exactly.

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The next word is airbags.

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Airbags.

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Airbags.

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Airbags.

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
These are like big bags of air that fill up and come out of the car when there's a crash.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Right, so that way you don't hit your head against the steering wheel or something like that.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So they protect you.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Right.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I've heard Volvo has like 18 airbags now in their cars.

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They are very safe cars, you know.

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like a big balloon.

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, our third word today is brakes.

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Brakes.

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Brakes.

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Brakes.

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So what are brakes?

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Brakes are little...

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What are brakes?

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Brakes are what make your car stop.

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, so they're the little machines maybe that stop your car?

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, they're on the wheels.

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah.

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
They make your car stop.

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You have brakes on your bike, on your car, etc.

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Our last word today on Language Takeaway, reinforced.

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Reinforced.

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Reinforced.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Reinforced.

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So we have some examples of how we use reinforced because it's a little bit weird.

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, these will help you understand the meaning.

137
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Example one.

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So I reinforced all the walls.

139
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There's no way they're going to fall down.

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Example two.

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This plastic is reinforced with glass, so it's both light and strong.

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So basically anything that's reinforced is made stronger.

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Perfect.

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Reinforced steel, reinforced table, anything.

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, great.

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So now we could listen to our dialogue again.

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You can practice all these words that we just talked about and we'll come back shortly.

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hi there.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Can I help you folks?

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My daughter wants a car for her birthday.

152
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You know how it is.

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Dad, I'm 16 already and I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
She is right, you know.

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Kids these days all have cars.

156
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let me show you something we just got in.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
A 1996 sedan.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Excellent gas mileage.

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It has dual airbags and anti-lock brakes.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
A perfect vehicle for a young driver.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Dad, I love it.

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's awesome.

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Can we get this one please?

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I see.

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What can you tell me about this one?

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Now, about this sedan.

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Tell me more about this tank.

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short-range missile attacks.

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It does not.

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, I don't know.

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let me sleep on it.

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll take it.

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Dad.

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So we have a couple of interesting phrases to talk about shopping.

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right.

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's look at these in Fluency Builder.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Fluency Builder.

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The first one today is I'm just browsing.

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm just browsing.

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm just browsing.

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm just browsing.

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is a really useful phrase because usually salespeople will come up to you and ask you, can I help you?

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Are you interested in something?

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And you're just looking.

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, maybe you don't really want to buy.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Right.

192
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So you're just, I'm just browsing.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So then they'll just leave you alone.

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, they won't bother you as much.

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, it's a good, good phrase.

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Another good phrase.

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Sleep on it.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Sleep on it.

199
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Sleep on it.

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So we have some examples of how you sleep on it.

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Example one.

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't know if we should buy that house.

203
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's perfect for us, but it's so expensive.

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's sleep on it.

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Example two.

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why don't you sleep on it and tell me tomorrow?

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Example three.

208
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is a bit more than what I can afford.

209
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let me sleep on it.

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
To sleep on it means to like to think about it overnight.

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
To think about it.

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah.

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So maybe you want to buy this really expensive car, but you need to think about it.

214
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Right.

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So you'll sleep on it.

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So yeah, you go home, sleep on it, think about it twice and then make a decision.

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Exactly.

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay.

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Great words and great dialogue.

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So yeah, I love this dialogue.

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It was, it's kind of funny.

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So we could listen to it again and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about it.

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hi there.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Can I help you folks?

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
My daughter wants a car for her birthday.

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You know how it is.

228
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Dad, I'm 16 already.

229
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
She's right.

231
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You know, kids these days all have cars.

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let me show you something.

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We just got in a 1996 sedan.

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Excellent gas mileage.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It has dual airbags and anti-lock brakes, a perfect vehicle for a young driver.

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Dad, I love it.

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's awesome.

238
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Can we get this one please?

239
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I see.

240
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What can you tell me about this one?

241
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Now about this sedan.

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

244
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Tell me more about this tank.

245
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

246
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short range missile attacks.

247
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It does not.

249
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Well, I don't know.

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Let me sleep on it.

251
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

252
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll take it.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Dad.

254
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So Marco, have you ever driven a tank?

255
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, I mean, I know you're in the army, so.

256
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah, actually I did.

257
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I did drive a tank before.

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Really?

259
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, really old one.

260
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Kind of like a World War II type tank.

261
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But yeah, they're really fun and interesting.

262
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You have, it's not like driving a normal car.

263
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You have pedals and there's no steering wheel.

264
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No, no, no.

265
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You have levers.

266
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah.

267
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And what many people don't know is that actually tanks are manual transmissions.

268
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You have to change gears.

269
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh really?

270
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And it's really hard to change gears on those things.

271
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And what's the gas mileage like in a tank?

272
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't know.

273
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Maybe like five miles per gallon.

274
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay.

275
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
They run on diesel, which is a different type of fuel, right?

276
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yep.

277
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay.

278
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, very cool.

279
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I never knew that my podcast partner had driven a tank.

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's pretty awesome.

281
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah.

282
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, it was, it was fun.

283
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Definitely.

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And I hope I get to do it again someday.

285
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,000
All right.

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, guys, have you ever driven a tank or a submarine or any type of armored vehicle?

287
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah.

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Tell us about it at our website, EnglishPod.com.

289
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Right.

290
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We'll be there to answer all your questions.

291
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll also be there to maybe post some more crazy stories or some pictures of the tank.

292
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Maybe.

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah.

294
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
All right, guys, we'll see you there.

295
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Until then, it's goodbye.
