00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,339
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,900
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,199
And today we're bringing you another great lesson for all of you who are interested in shopping.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,140
Especially those of you who are interested in shopping for a car.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,580
A car, exactly.

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,039
So we're going to give you some great language about describing a car or characteristics of a car.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,399
Yep.

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,019
And also some really interesting language for shopping.

10
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:27,500
Yes, especially buying something really big and expensive.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,500
Yeah, like a car.

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:28,899
Yep.

13
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,719
So before we listen to our dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,000
Vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,479
On vocabulary preview today, we're bringing you two words.

16
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:40,640
The first one is vehicle.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Vehicle.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:42,979
Vehicle.

19
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:43,719
Vehicle.

20
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,439
So again, a vehicle is a machine, right?

21
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:50,820
Right, a machine that carries people from one place to another.

22
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:58,579
So it's important to say that a vehicle could be an airplane, a car, a car, a boat, a boat, even a bicycle.

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,119
Right.

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:00:59,500
Yep.

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,340
That's a vehicle.

26
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,600
Our second word is sedan.

27
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:04,780
Sedan.

28
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:05,640
Sedan.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,560
Sedan.

30
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,719
So a sedan is a type of car.

31
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:10,319
Exactly.

32
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,780
It's a type of car with four doors that can fit five people inside.

33
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:18,680
So to make it more clear, most taxis are sedans.

34
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,180
Exactly.

35
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:19,739
Right?

36
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,040
Yep.

37
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,079
They have four doors, five people can fit in there including the driver, except taxis in Mexico.

38
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:26,340
They're not sedans?

39
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,359
They're little beetles.

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,060
Oh.

41
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:30,599
They're Volkswagen beetles, so those are not sedans.

42
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,840
But yeah, most countries have sedans as taxis.

43
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,180
To give you some examples, like a Toyota Corolla or a Toyota Camry is a sedan.

44
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:38,980
Yeah, yeah.

45
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,939
Maybe like a Volkswagen Jetta.

46
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:41,640
Is that a...

47
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,019
A Jetta?

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,079
Yeah, a Jetta is a sedan.

49
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:43,439
Yep.

50
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,620
Now we can listen to our dialogue, and it's going to be at a normal speed the first time, but you don't have to worry about it.

51
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:52,159
We'll come back and teach you some of the important words from the dialogue.

52
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,099
Hi there.

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,760
Can I help you folks?

54
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,959
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

55
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:08,939
My daughter wants a car for her birthday.

56
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:09,879
You know how it is.

57
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,800
Dad, I'm 16 already, and I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

58
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:17,039
She's right, you know.

59
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,719
Kids these days all have cars.

60
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,419
Let me show you something we just got in.

61
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,039
A 1996 sedan.

62
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,500
Excellent gas mileage.

63
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,620
It has dual airbags and anti-light brakes.

64
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,620
A perfect vehicle for a young driver.

65
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,300
Dad, I love it.

66
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:30,139
It's awesome.

67
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,099
Can we get this one, please?

68
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:34,199
I see.

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,159
What can you tell me about this one?

70
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,240
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

71
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:42,620
Now about this sedan.

72
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

73
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,620
Tell me more about this tank.

74
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,800
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

75
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,520
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short-range missile attacks.

76
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,340
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

77
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,139
It does not.

78
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,819
Well, I don't know.

79
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,099
Let me sleep on it.

80
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

81
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:07,479
I'll take it.

82
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,340
Dad!

83
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,419
I think she's really lucky.

84
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:18,979
Really?

85
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,060
She's getting a tank to go to school.

86
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,199
How awesome is that?

87
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,919
I would be so embarrassed if I had to drive to school in a tank.

88
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,120
That's like the coolest car.

89
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:28,280
Oh, you're such a boy.

90
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:34,879
Alright, a surprising ending to a relatively easy shopping day.

91
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,300
Yeah.

92
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,099
Let's take a look at some language that we saw in our dialogue on Language Takeaway.

93
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,979
Language Takeaway.

94
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,580
We have four words for you today.

95
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,039
The first one is gas mileage.

96
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,580
Gas mileage.

97
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,539
Gas mileage.

98
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,080
Gas mileage.

99
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,960
So gas mileage is how many miles you can travel on a gallon or liter of gasoline.

100
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, you know what's interesting?

101
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:11,280
In some English-speaking countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, we use kilometers to measure distance, but we still talk about gas mileage.

102
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,719
I guess you can't say gas kilo-mileage.

103
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:16,259
No.

104
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:26,439
But yeah, it's basically how many kilometers or how many miles you can travel on a tank or on a liter or gallon of gas.

105
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:26,899
Exactly.

106
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,339
Okay.

107
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,439
The next word is airbags.

108
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:32,379
Airbags.

109
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:33,300
Airbags.

110
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,699
Airbags.

111
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,259
These are like big bags of air that fill up and come out of the car when there's a crash.

112
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,860
Right, so that way you don't hit your head against the steering wheel or something like that.

113
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,819
So they protect you.

114
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:46,300
Right.

115
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:49,439
I've heard Volvo has like 18 airbags now in their cars.

116
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:51,819
They are very safe cars, you know.

117
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,180
Like a big balloon.

118
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,540
Okay, our third word today is brakes.

119
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:57,720
Brakes.

120
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,660
Brakes.

121
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,339
Brakes.

122
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,720
So what are brakes?

123
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,139
Brakes are little...

124
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:03,620
What are brakes?

125
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,259
Brakes are what make your car stop.

126
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,600
Okay, so they're the little machines maybe that stop your car?

127
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,639
Yeah, they're on the wheels.

128
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:11,959
Yeah.

129
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,060
They make your car stop.

130
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,899
You have brakes on your bike, on your car, etc.

131
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:21,240
Our last word today on Language Takeaway, reinforced.

132
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,899
Reinforced.

133
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,360
Reinforced.

134
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,259
Reinforced.

135
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,980
So we have some examples of how we use reinforced because it's a little bit weird.

136
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,139
Yeah, these will help you understand the meaning.

137
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,120
Example one.

138
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,000
So I reinforced all the walls.

139
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,879
There's no way they're going to fall down.

140
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,160
Example two.

141
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,180
This plastic is reinforced with glass, so it's both light and strong.

142
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,660
So basically anything that's reinforced is made stronger.

143
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:09,339
Perfect.

144
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,939
Reinforced steel, reinforced table, anything.

145
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,480
Okay, great.

146
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,259
So now we could listen to our dialogue again.

147
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:18,920
You can practice all these words that we just talked about and we'll come back shortly.

148
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,759
Hi there.

149
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,629
Can I help you folks?

150
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,850
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

151
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,829
My daughter wants a car for her birthday.

152
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,730
You know how it is.

153
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:43,910
Dad, I'm 16 already and I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

154
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:45,949
She is right, you know.

155
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:48,750
Kids these days all have cars.

156
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,290
Let me show you something we just got in.

157
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,829
A 1996 sedan.

158
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,230
Excellent gas mileage.

159
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,209
It has dual airbags and anti-lock brakes.

160
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:04,189
A perfect vehicle for a young driver.

161
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:06,689
Dad, I love it.

162
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:08,509
It's awesome.

163
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,949
Can we get this one please?

164
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,850
I see.

165
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,990
What can you tell me about this one?

166
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:23,870
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

167
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:26,250
Now, about this sedan.

168
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,350
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

169
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,689
Tell me more about this tank.

170
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:40,250
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

171
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:46,769
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short-range missile attacks.

172
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,810
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

173
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,709
It does not.

174
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:55,490
Well, I don't know.

175
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,370
Let me sleep on it.

176
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,329
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

177
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,550
I'll take it.

178
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,670
Dad.

179
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:14,069
So we have a couple of interesting phrases to talk about shopping.

180
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:14,889
Right.

181
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,110
Let's look at these in Fluency Builder.

182
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:19,250
Fluency Builder.

183
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:22,689
The first one today is I'm just browsing.

184
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:24,910
I'm just browsing.

185
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,490
I'm just browsing.

186
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:27,670
I'm just browsing.

187
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,610
This is a really useful phrase because usually salespeople will come up to you and ask you, can I help you?

188
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,529
Are you interested in something?

189
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,929
And you're just looking.

190
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,149
Yeah, maybe you don't really want to buy.

191
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:38,570
Right.

192
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,590
So you're just, I'm just browsing.

193
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,850
So then they'll just leave you alone.

194
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,429
Yeah, they won't bother you as much.

195
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,190
Yeah, it's a good, good phrase.

196
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:47,429
Another good phrase.

197
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:49,350
Sleep on it.

198
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:50,409
Sleep on it.

199
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,610
Sleep on it.

200
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,029
So we have some examples of how you sleep on it.

201
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,090
Example one.

202
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,549
I don't know if we should buy that house.

203
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,850
It's perfect for us, but it's so expensive.

204
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,049
Let's sleep on it.

205
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:15,809
Example two.

206
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,990
Why don't you sleep on it and tell me tomorrow?

207
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:28,830
Example three.

208
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:34,450
This is a bit more than what I can afford.

209
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,670
Let me sleep on it.

210
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,669
To sleep on it means to like to think about it overnight.

211
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,610
To think about it.

212
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:44,830
Yeah.

213
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,850
So maybe you want to buy this really expensive car, but you need to think about it.

214
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,129
Right.

215
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,470
So you'll sleep on it.

216
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:55,870
So yeah, you go home, sleep on it, think about it twice and then make a decision.

217
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,389
Exactly.

218
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,210
Okay.

219
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,669
Great words and great dialogue.

220
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,129
So yeah, I love this dialogue.

221
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,570
It was, it's kind of funny.

222
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:05,230
So we could listen to it again and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about it.

223
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:19,950
Hi there.

224
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:20,629
Can I help you folks?

225
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,809
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

226
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,789
My daughter wants a car for her birthday.

227
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,750
You know how it is.

228
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,370
Dad, I'm 16 already.

229
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:34,649
And I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

230
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:35,509
She's right.

231
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,570
You know, kids these days all have cars.

232
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,669
Let me show you something.

233
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:40,950
We just got in a 1996 sedan.

234
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,389
Excellent gas mileage.

235
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,490
It has dual airbags and anti-lock brakes, a perfect vehicle for a young driver.

236
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:48,149
Dad, I love it.

237
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:49,009
It's awesome.

238
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,029
Can we get this one please?

239
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,049
I see.

240
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:55,029
What can you tell me about this one?

241
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,129
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

242
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:01,470
Now about this sedan.

243
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,830
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

244
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:04,470
Tell me more about this tank.

245
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,629
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

246
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,370
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short range missile attacks.

247
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,190
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

248
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:20,009
It does not.

249
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:21,730
Well, I don't know.

250
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,970
Let me sleep on it.

251
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,330
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

252
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,350
I'll take it.

253
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:27,190
Dad.

254
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,350
So Marco, have you ever driven a tank?

255
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:40,289
Well, I mean, I know you're in the army, so.

256
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,370
Yeah, actually I did.

257
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:45,429
I did drive a tank before.

258
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:46,029
Really?

259
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:47,409
Yeah, really old one.

260
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,230
Kind of like a World War II type tank.

261
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:50,769
But yeah, they're really fun and interesting.

262
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:52,889
You have, it's not like driving a normal car.

263
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,129
You have pedals and there's no steering wheel.

264
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,929
No, no, no.

265
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,210
You have levers.

266
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:57,809
Yeah.

267
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:03,409
And what many people don't know is that actually tanks are manual transmissions.

268
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:04,590
You have to change gears.

269
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:05,409
Oh really?

270
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,110
And it's really hard to change gears on those things.

271
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:10,049
And what's the gas mileage like in a tank?

272
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:11,629
I don't know.

273
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,409
Maybe like five miles per gallon.

274
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:13,830
Okay.

275
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,950
They run on diesel, which is a different type of fuel, right?

276
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,210
Yep.

277
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:17,590
Okay.

278
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,389
Well, very cool.

279
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:22,110
I never knew that my podcast partner had driven a tank.

280
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:22,889
That's pretty awesome.

281
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,210
Yeah.

282
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:24,549
Well, it was, it was fun.

283
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:24,990
Definitely.

284
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,029
And I hope I get to do it again someday.

285
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:27,629
All right.

286
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:35,409
Well, guys, have you ever driven a tank or a submarine or any type of armored vehicle?

287
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,789
Yeah.

288
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,149
Tell us about it at our website, EnglishPod.com.

289
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:39,990
Right.

290
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,889
We'll be there to answer all your questions.

291
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:46,450
I'll also be there to maybe post some more crazy stories or some pictures of the tank.

292
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,070
Maybe.

293
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,509
Yeah.

294
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:48,889
All right, guys, we'll see you there.

295
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,090
Until then, it's goodbye.
