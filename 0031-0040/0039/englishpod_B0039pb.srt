1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And we're bringing you another great elementary lesson for all those elementary learners.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In today's lesson, we've got some excellent language that will help you to describe someone's appearance.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's something that everyone has learned before in school, describing people.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we're going to review that and give you some better phrases.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Some real English phrases.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Real English phrases.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay, great.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time, and then we'll come back and talk about it.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I heard you were on a date last night.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So how did it go?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I want all the juicy details.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Um, well, actually, we had a fantastic time last night.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He was amazing.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, now you really have to fill me in.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What's he like?

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
He's really good looking.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He's quite tall, around 6'1".

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He's in his early 30s, and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He sounds hot!

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What does he do for a living?

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You know what?

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is the best part.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank, so he's got a great career path ahead of him.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hold on a sec.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
His name is David?

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's my brother!

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Alright, so, interesting dialogue.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Small world.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It is a small world.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know how I would feel about dating my friend's brother.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Really?

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No, I wouldn't feel good about it.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why?

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, because if you break up with the brother, that means you'll have to end the friendship with your best friend.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Maybe.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Dangerous.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Girls are more complicated with that.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Guys, we're not that complicated.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, you know what?

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's look at the language before this gets too far.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Alright, let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
On Language Takeaway today, we're bringing you three words.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The first one is heard.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Heard.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Heard.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Heard.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So you guys know this word.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Past tense of here, right?

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Right.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But the way it's used is quite interesting.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's listen to a couple of examples of how it's used.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Example one.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I heard you're dating a new guy.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Example two.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Julie told me she heard that you're pregnant.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Example three.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What?

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You got fired?

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I heard that you quit.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So when you say, for example, oh, I heard you were pregnant.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Whoa, this is like telling someone that you found some information about them, but you're not sure if it's true or if it's false.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Our next word, fill me in.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Fill me in.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Fill me in.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Fill me in.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So when you tell someone to fill you in.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're saying tell me about it.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Tell me the details.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Uh-huh.

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I could say, I'm sorry I was late for the meeting.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Can you fill me in on what happened?

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Exactly.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Or I could say, I missed the first five minutes of the movie.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Fill me in.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Exactly.

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Great word.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And our last phrase today, career path.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Career path.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Career path.

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Career path.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So what's a career path?

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I guess this is the plan for your job over several like 10 or 20 years.

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Right.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All the different jobs and things you do during your career.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's your career path.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So in this case, David has a really good career path because he's going to be a really rich and powerful investment banker.

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So career path.

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Very good.

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So now let's listen to our dialogue again and pay special attention to the language used to describe David because when we come back, we're going to talk about this.

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Irene, I heard you were on a date last night, so how did it go?

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I want all the juicy details.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Um, well, actually we had a fantastic time last night.

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He was amazing.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay.

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Now you really have to fill me in.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's he like?

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He's really good looking.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He's quite tall around six one.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He's in his early thirties and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He sounds hot.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What does he do for a living?

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You know what?

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is the best part.

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank, so he's got a great career path ahead of him.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hold on a sec.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
His name is David?

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's my brother.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So we found some really great words and phrases used to describe someone.

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Exactly.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There's a lot of language in here talking about the way someone looks.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So let's listen again as Irene describes David.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He's really good looking.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He's quite tall around six one.

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He's in his early thirties and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's really good looking.

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He's quite tall around six one.

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He's in his early thirties and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay, so let's break this down.

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The first thing she says is he's really good looking.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Good looking.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Good looking.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Good looking.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So good looking is the equivalent of handsome.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Or pretty.

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Pretty.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah.

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Good looking.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But I think good looking sounds a lot more natural than handsome.

139
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, you wouldn't really use handsome.

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I would never say that.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Even though it's correct, it's just good looking sounds much more natural.

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I guess for me, whenever someone says handsome, it sounds like an older person saying that.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, it sounds old fashioned.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Like my grandma would say, oh, he's a handsome young man.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, exactly.

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay, now let's look at the next thing she said.

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He's quite tall.

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Quite tall.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Quite tall.

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Quite tall.

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So we know quite means very.

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And tall we know.

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Right.

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So you can describe a person in different ways.

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He's quite tall.

156
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He's kind of tall.

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He's sort of tall.

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
He's a bit short.

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He's not that short.

160
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So these are great words we can use to describe someone's height.

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Then she talked about his exact height.

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Right?

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
She said he was six one.

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Six one.

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Around six one.

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This is interesting because in the United States and Canada, you give a person's height using feet and inches.

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's right.

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So we don't talk about meters and centimeters.

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So six one would be six feet one inch.

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Exactly.

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But in other countries, you would talk about centimeters or meters.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So six one is like, six one is about 180.

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah.

177
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
About that.

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So this is an interesting difference between like English speaking countries and European countries.

179
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So the next time you give your height to someone, make sure you do it in feet more or less.

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It sounds a lot more natural.

182
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And actually, if you say to somebody in Canada, for example, I'm 175 centimeters, they wouldn't know really how tall that was.

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How tall that is.

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay.

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Now, the next part is really, really useful.

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She said he's in his early 30s.

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
In his early 30s.

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
His early 30s.

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Early 30s.

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So this is a way of describing someone's age without actually giving the exact number.

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Exactly.

192
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So for example, early 30s.

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So like 32, 33, mid 30s, like 34, 35, 36, 36.

194
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And then late 30s would be 38, 39.

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And you could do the same thing for like 40s, 50s, 60s, 20s, right?

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Starting at 20s.

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You wouldn't do that.

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You wouldn't do this before your 20s.

199
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't think it's really common to talk about your teens.

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You wouldn't say like his mid teens or early teens.

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Sounds a bit weird.

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

203
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Great language used to describe people.

204
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But one more word.

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Right.

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He's hot.

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He's hot.

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Or he sounds hot.

209
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah.

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He's hot.

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah.

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So this is another sort of informal way of describing someone who's really good looking.

213
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Good looking.

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Really sexy.

215
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Right.

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It could be girl or boy.

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She's hot.

218
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But it is informal.

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It is really informal.

220
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Maybe even a little bit offensive.

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You wouldn't go up to a girl and say, wow, you're hot.

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No.

223
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's a little bit too impolite.

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You would say, wow, you're really pretty or you're gorgeous.

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But you wouldn't say, wow.

226
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No.

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You would never say that to somebody.

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's something you would comment with your friends.

229
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay.

231
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So we've looked at some really good language for describing people.

232
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now we could listen to our dialogue a third time and I'm sure you will understand everything.

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I heard you were on a date last night.

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So how did it go?

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I want all the juicy details.

236
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Um, well, actually we had a fantastic time last night.

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He was amazing.

238
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay.

239
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Now you really have to fill me in.

240
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What's he like?

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He's really good looking.

242
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He's quite tall around six one.

243
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He's in his early thirties and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

244
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He sounds hot.

245
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What does he do for a living?

246
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You know what?

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This is the best part.

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
David is a junior investment banker at fortune bank.

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So he's got a great career path ahead of him.

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Hold on a sec.

251
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
His name is David.

252
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah.

253
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's my brother.

254
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay.

255
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So we looked at really useful language for describing people and we want you to describe your girlfriend, boyfriend, or even yourself or even yourself.

256
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What do you look like?

257
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
How tall are you?

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
How old are you?

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
How old are you?

260
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And try and use the language from today's lesson.

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Right.

262
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So come to EnglishPod.com and leave your questions and comments on our website and your description and your descriptions.

263
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yep.

And we'll definitely be there to answer any doubts as well.

265
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes.

266
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
