00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,899
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,620
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,379
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,379
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,519
And we're bringing you another great elementary lesson for all those elementary learners.

6
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:14,919
In today's lesson, we've got some excellent language that will help you to describe someone's appearance.

7
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,100
It's something that everyone has learned before in school, describing people.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,199
So we're going to review that and give you some better phrases.

9
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,960
Some real English phrases.

10
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:25,039
Real English phrases.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,379
Okay, great.

12
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,300
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time, and then we'll come back and talk about it.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,159
I heard you were on a date last night.

14
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,200
So how did it go?

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,000
I want all the juicy details.

16
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,840
Um, well, actually, we had a fantastic time last night.

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,960
He was amazing.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, now you really have to fill me in.

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:54,960
What's he like?

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,560
He's really good looking.

21
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,340
He's quite tall, around 6'1".

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,719
He's in his early 30s, and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,299
He sounds hot!

24
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,840
What does he do for a living?

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,840
You know what?

26
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,519
This is the best part.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,579
David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank, so he's got a great career path ahead of him.

28
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,219
Hold on a sec.

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,359
His name is David?

30
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:20,060
Yeah.

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,819
That's my brother!

32
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,560
Alright, so, interesting dialogue.

33
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,680
Small world.

34
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,719
It is a small world.

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,760
I don't know how I would feel about dating my friend's brother.

36
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:40,219
Really?

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,920
No, I wouldn't feel good about it.

38
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:42,159
Why?

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,859
Well, because if you break up with the brother, that means you'll have to end the friendship with your best friend.

40
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,400
Maybe.

41
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,159
Dangerous.

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,900
Girls are more complicated with that.

43
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,219
Guys, we're not that complicated.

44
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,280
Well, you know what?

45
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,060
Let's look at the language before this gets too far.

46
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,299
Alright, let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,599
On Language Takeaway today, we're bringing you three words.

48
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,020
The first one is heard.

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:14,919
Heard.

50
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:15,500
Heard.

51
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:16,740
Heard.

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,379
So you guys know this word.

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,960
Past tense of here, right?

54
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:20,560
Right.

55
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,740
But the way it's used is quite interesting.

56
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,879
Let's listen to a couple of examples of how it's used.

57
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:28,939
Example one.

58
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,199
I heard you're dating a new guy.

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,800
Example two.

60
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,319
Julie told me she heard that you're pregnant.

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,919
Example three.

62
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,360
What?

63
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,319
You got fired?

64
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,879
I heard that you quit.

65
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,219
So when you say, for example, oh, I heard you were pregnant.

66
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,599
Whoa, this is like telling someone that you found some information about them, but you're not sure if it's true or if it's false.

67
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,180
Okay.

68
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,879
Our next word, fill me in.

69
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,280
Fill me in.

70
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,620
Fill me in.

71
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:10,580
Fill me in.

72
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,819
So when you tell someone to fill you in.

73
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,439
You're saying tell me about it.

74
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,280
Tell me the details.

75
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:15,659
Uh-huh.

76
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,280
I could say, I'm sorry I was late for the meeting.

77
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,840
Can you fill me in on what happened?

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,300
Exactly.

79
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,699
Or I could say, I missed the first five minutes of the movie.

80
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,500
Fill me in.

81
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,139
Exactly.

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,860
Okay.

83
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:27,639
Great word.

84
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,560
And our last phrase today, career path.

85
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:31,840
Career path.

86
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,139
Career path.

87
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,000
Career path.

88
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,860
So what's a career path?

89
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:42,099
I guess this is the plan for your job over several like 10 or 20 years.

90
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:42,639
Right.

91
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,580
All the different jobs and things you do during your career.

92
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,159
Yeah.

93
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:47,180
That's your career path.

94
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:56,680
So in this case, David has a really good career path because he's going to be a really rich and powerful investment banker.

95
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:57,319
Yes.

96
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,919
So career path.

97
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,120
Very good.

98
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:09,699
So now let's listen to our dialogue again and pay special attention to the language used to describe David because when we come back, we're going to talk about this.

99
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:23,939
Irene, I heard you were on a date last night, so how did it go?

100
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:26,519
I want all the juicy details.

101
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,000
Um, well, actually we had a fantastic time last night.

102
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,480
He was amazing.

103
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:36,879
Okay.

104
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,420
Now you really have to fill me in.

105
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:41,879
What's he like?

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,379
He's really good looking.

107
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:47,779
He's quite tall around six one.

108
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,160
He's in his early thirties and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

109
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,519
He sounds hot.

110
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,220
What does he do for a living?

111
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:02,319
You know what?

112
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,399
This is the best part.

113
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:13,379
David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank, so he's got a great career path ahead of him.

114
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,339
Hold on a sec.

115
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:17,500
His name is David?

116
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:18,839
Yeah.

117
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,800
That's my brother.

118
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,660
So we found some really great words and phrases used to describe someone.

119
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,480
Exactly.

120
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:38,740
There's a lot of language in here talking about the way someone looks.

121
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,680
So let's listen again as Irene describes David.

122
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:46,100
He's really good looking.

123
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:49,420
He's quite tall around six one.

124
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:55,899
He's in his early thirties and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

125
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,860
He's really good looking.

126
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,180
He's quite tall around six one.

127
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,560
He's in his early thirties and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

128
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,600
Okay, so let's break this down.

129
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,939
The first thing she says is he's really good looking.

130
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:18,819
Good looking.

131
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,660
Good looking.

132
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:20,319
Good looking.

133
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,860
So good looking is the equivalent of handsome.

134
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,579
Or pretty.

135
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,160
Pretty.

136
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,519
Yeah.

137
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,019
Good looking.

138
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,180
But I think good looking sounds a lot more natural than handsome.

139
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,439
Yeah, you wouldn't really use handsome.

140
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,800
I would never say that.

141
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,259
Even though it's correct, it's just good looking sounds much more natural.

142
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,399
I guess for me, whenever someone says handsome, it sounds like an older person saying that.

143
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,160
Yeah, it sounds old fashioned.

144
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,480
Like my grandma would say, oh, he's a handsome young man.

145
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:46,319
Yeah, exactly.

146
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,279
Okay, now let's look at the next thing she said.

147
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,139
He's quite tall.

148
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,259
Quite tall.

149
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,579
Quite tall.

150
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,300
Quite tall.

151
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:56,579
So we know quite means very.

152
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,560
And tall we know.

153
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,079
Right.

154
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,199
So you can describe a person in different ways.

155
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,519
He's quite tall.

156
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:04,839
He's kind of tall.

157
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,839
He's sort of tall.

158
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,920
He's a bit short.

159
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,459
He's not that short.

160
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:11,639
Okay.

161
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,519
So these are great words we can use to describe someone's height.

162
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:15,779
Okay.

163
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,720
Then she talked about his exact height.

164
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:19,699
Yes.

165
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,300
Right?

166
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,939
She said he was six one.

167
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,680
Six one.

168
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,079
Around six one.

169
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:30,860
This is interesting because in the United States and Canada, you give a person's height using feet and inches.

170
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,639
That's right.

171
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,240
So we don't talk about meters and centimeters.

172
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,540
So six one would be six feet one inch.

173
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,079
Exactly.

174
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:42,100
But in other countries, you would talk about centimeters or meters.

175
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,120
So six one is like, six one is about 180.

176
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:45,800
Yeah.

177
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,279
About that.

178
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:52,220
So this is an interesting difference between like English speaking countries and European countries.

179
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,420
Okay.

180
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,040
So the next time you give your height to someone, make sure you do it in feet more or less.

181
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,680
It sounds a lot more natural.

182
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:08,300
And actually, if you say to somebody in Canada, for example, I'm 175 centimeters, they wouldn't know really how tall that was.

183
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,699
How tall that is.

184
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,180
Okay.

185
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,639
Now, the next part is really, really useful.

186
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,939
She said he's in his early 30s.

187
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,899
In his early 30s.

188
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,579
His early 30s.

189
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,160
Early 30s.

190
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,060
So this is a way of describing someone's age without actually giving the exact number.

191
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:27,519
Exactly.

192
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,199
So for example, early 30s.

193
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,519
So like 32, 33, mid 30s, like 34, 35, 36, 36.

194
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,820
And then late 30s would be 38, 39.

195
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,460
And you could do the same thing for like 40s, 50s, 60s, 20s, right?

196
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,399
Starting at 20s.

197
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,000
You wouldn't do that.

198
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,679
You wouldn't do this before your 20s.

199
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,919
I don't think it's really common to talk about your teens.

200
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,059
You wouldn't say like his mid teens or early teens.

201
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:56,039
Sounds a bit weird.

202
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,440
Okay.

203
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,519
Great language used to describe people.

204
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,740
But one more word.

205
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:01,700
Right.

206
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,600
He's hot.

207
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,779
He's hot.

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,919
Or he sounds hot.

209
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,320
Yeah.

210
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:06,460
He's hot.

211
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:06,779
Yeah.

212
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,159
So this is another sort of informal way of describing someone who's really good looking.

213
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:13,799
Good looking.

214
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,500
Really sexy.

215
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:14,860
Right.

216
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,840
It could be girl or boy.

217
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:16,720
She's hot.

218
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,500
But it is informal.

219
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,059
It is really informal.

220
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,019
Maybe even a little bit offensive.

221
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:24,240
You wouldn't go up to a girl and say, wow, you're hot.

222
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:24,679
No.

223
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,580
It's a little bit too impolite.

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,200
You would say, wow, you're really pretty or you're gorgeous.

225
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,220
But you wouldn't say, wow.

226
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,639
No.

227
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,559
You would never say that to somebody.

228
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,820
That's something you would comment with your friends.

229
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:35,080
Yeah.

230
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:35,620
Okay.

231
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,480
So we've looked at some really good language for describing people.

232
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,960
Now we could listen to our dialogue a third time and I'm sure you will understand everything.

233
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,179
I heard you were on a date last night.

234
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,240
So how did it go?

235
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,039
I want all the juicy details.

236
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,860
Um, well, actually we had a fantastic time last night.

237
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,980
He was amazing.

238
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:08,879
Okay.

239
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,019
Now you really have to fill me in.

240
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,980
What's he like?

241
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,600
He's really good looking.

242
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,940
He's quite tall around six one.

243
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:20,759
He's in his early thirties and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

244
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
He sounds hot.

245
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,879
What does he do for a living?

246
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:25,799
You know what?

247
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,639
This is the best part.

248
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:30,940
David is a junior investment banker at fortune bank.

249
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,620
So he's got a great career path ahead of him.

250
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,259
Hold on a sec.

251
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,379
His name is David.

252
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,139
Yeah.

253
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,980
That's my brother.

254
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,500
Okay.

255
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:54,519
So we looked at really useful language for describing people and we want you to describe your girlfriend, boyfriend, or even yourself or even yourself.

256
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,340
What do you look like?

257
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,299
How tall are you?

258
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,139
How old are you?

259
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:57,679
How old are you?

260
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,259
And try and use the language from today's lesson.

261
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:00,759
Right.

262
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,299
So come to EnglishPod.com and leave your questions and comments on our website and your description and your descriptions.

263
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:06,639
Yep.

265
