00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we're bringing you another great lesson about appointments.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We've got an elementary lesson about canceling an appointment.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's a really common situation sometimes.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You have an appointment at the doctor's or something.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Or at work.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And you have to cancel it.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we're going to learn some great language to help you cancel appointments today.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's as Samantha and Angela have a phone conversation and Angela is trying to cancel an appointment.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And it's going to be a little bit fast in the beginning.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But when we come back, we will explain all the great vocabulary.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hello, Samantha speaking.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi, Samantha.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is Angela calling.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, hi, Angela.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What's up?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let me see.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm really sorry.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's just this thing came up and...

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Angela, you know what?

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I can't make it to our meeting either.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sounds great.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
See you tomorrow.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Angela?

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Angela, look up.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Isn't that Samantha?

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What?

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh no, I think she saw me.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, we have some really interesting words that you probably listen to in this dialogue, so let's start with language takeaway.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Language takeaway.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Today on Language Takeaway, we're bringing you three words.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Erica, what's the first one?

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The first word is reschedule.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Reschedule.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Reschedule.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Reschedule.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
When you reschedule an appointment, you change it for another day or time.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Exactly.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Great.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The second word that we have is inconvenience.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Inconvenience.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Inconvenience.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Inconvenience.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So to inconvenience someone is to...

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To make things not convenient for that person.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So to make things a little bit difficult or to make things a little bit...

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Uncomfortable.

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Uncomfortable.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Inconvenience.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And our third word is...

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Postpone.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Postpone.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Postpone.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Postpone.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We have some examples of the word postpone that will help you to understand its meaning a little bit better.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's listen.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Example one.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Since Robert is late again, we have to postpone the meeting.

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Example two.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry, Simon, but your vacation has been postponed until next month.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Example three.

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Unfortunately, the flight will be postponed.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, so basically postpone is to delay.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's right.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Make it at a later time.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
At a later time.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, some great words there and we can listen to our dialogue a second time at a slower speed.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hello, Samantha speaking.

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hi, Samantha.

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This is Angela calling.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, hi, Angela.

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What's up?

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let me see.

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm really sorry.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's just this thing came up and...

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Angela, you know what?

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can't make it to our meeting either.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Sounds great.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
See you tomorrow.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Angela, Angela, look up.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Isn't that Samantha?

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What?

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, no, I think she saw me.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
All right, so in this dialogue, we had some really great phrases that we should look at in Fluency Builder.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Fluency Builder.

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We have three phrases for you today in Fluency Builder, and the first one is so common.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a great phrase.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's up?

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's up?

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's up?

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So this is a very common way of saying hi.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah.

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What's up?

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How's it going?

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What's going on?

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Right, and now the interesting thing is that many people don't know how to answer this phrase.

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes, I see this all the time with my students.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So if you say what's up, you should say...

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Not much.

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Not much.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Nothing.

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Nothing.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So what's up?

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Not much.

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Not much.

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
All right, so the next time someone tells you what's up, now you know what to answer.

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay, our second phrase is can't make it.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Can't make it.

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Can't make it.

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can't make it.

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We use this phrase when we want to say, I cannot attend.

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I cannot make it.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, I can't come.

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Right, so if you're having a party today, I say, oh, I'm sorry, I can't make it.

137
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It means I can't go.

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Exactly.

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Maybe one more example.

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So Marco, we've got a meeting today at three o'clock.

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't make it.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm recording today.

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, okay.

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So can't make it.

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Our last word for Fluency Builder.

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This thing came up.

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This thing came up.

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This thing came up.

149
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is a great way of giving an excuse for why you can't make it.

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Right.

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So I can't make it today because this thing came up like something.

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Something happened.

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Something happened.

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, let's listen to a few examples of this phrase so we can see how it's used in the wild.

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Example one.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry that I'm late.

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This thing came up at work and I had to stay to take care of it.

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Example two.

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I can't talk right now.

160
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Something came up.

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Example three.

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sorry I missed the meeting.

163
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Something came up.

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay, great example and I guess it's perfectly clear now.

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes.

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So let's listen to our dialogue a third time and now we're ready to understand everything.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hello, Samantha speaking.

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hi Samantha, this is Angela calling.

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh hi Angela, what's up?

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

171
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I wonder is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let me see.

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm really sorry.

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

177
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's just this thing came up and...

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Angela, you know what?

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I can't make it to our meeting either.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

181
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Sounds great.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
See you tomorrow.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Angela?

184
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Angela, look up.

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Isn't that Samantha?

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What?

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh no, I think she saw me.

190
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So Erika, have you ever cancelled an appointment like this under false pretenses?

191
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So for a fake reason?

192
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
For a fake reason?

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
To go shopping?

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Well I may not have told my boss so I can't make it to a meeting because this thing came up and then I really was going shopping.

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I've never done that.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But how about you Marco?

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Well you know in Ecuador, soccer is a really big thing.

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Right.

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So when we were playing in the World Cup, Ecuador was playing and...

200
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Not you, but...

201
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Well no, like the Ecuadorian soccer team.

202
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I cancelled an appointment because I was going to go watch the game.

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Really?

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
A business appointment?

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
A business appointment.

206
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well I guess that's okay.

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah I mean it was like the first time we were ever in the World Cup and you know my boss didn't really put up much of a fight because I guess he also wanted to go watch the game.

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So very similar to the events in this dialogue.

209
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Very similar.

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I guess that's kind of the inspiration behind it.

211
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Alright guys I hope you found some of these phrases helpful and useful.

Bye!
