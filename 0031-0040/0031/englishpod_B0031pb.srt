00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,259
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,759
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:04,559
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,620
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,259
And today we're bringing you another great lesson about appointments.

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,160
That's right.

7
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,119
We've got an elementary lesson about canceling an appointment.

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,000
That's a really common situation sometimes.

9
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:19,780
You have an appointment at the doctor's or something.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,539
Or at work.

11
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:22,079
And you have to cancel it.

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:22,359
Yes.

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,460
So we're going to learn some great language to help you cancel appointments today.

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,840
Let's as Samantha and Angela have a phone conversation and Angela is trying to cancel an appointment.

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,079
And it's going to be a little bit fast in the beginning.

16
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,719
But when we come back, we will explain all the great vocabulary.

17
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:54,939
Hello, Samantha speaking.

18
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:56,219
Hi, Samantha.

19
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,560
This is Angela calling.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,579
Oh, hi, Angela.

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,079
What's up?

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,479
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,819
I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,359
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,560
Let me see.

26
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,239
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,780
I'm really sorry.

28
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,620
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,699
It's just this thing came up and...

30
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,120
Angela, you know what?

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,519
I can't make it to our meeting either.

32
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,640
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,599
Sounds great.

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,560
See you tomorrow.

35
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:29,780
Angela?

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,420
Angela, look up.

37
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,099
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

38
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,319
Isn't that Samantha?

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,180
What?

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,480
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,700
Oh no, I think she saw me.

42
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:52,780
Okay, we have some really interesting words that you probably listen to in this dialogue, so let's start with language takeaway.

43
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,400
Language takeaway.

44
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,859
Today on Language Takeaway, we're bringing you three words.

45
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,299
Erica, what's the first one?

46
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,799
The first word is reschedule.

47
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,219
Reschedule.

48
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,159
Reschedule.

49
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,700
Reschedule.

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,039
When you reschedule an appointment, you change it for another day or time.

51
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:12,599
Exactly.

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,639
Great.

53
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,300
The second word that we have is inconvenience.

54
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:18,879
Inconvenience.

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,439
Inconvenience.

56
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:20,719
Inconvenience.

57
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,719
So to inconvenience someone is to...

58
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,159
To make things not convenient for that person.

59
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,340
So to make things a little bit difficult or to make things a little bit...

60
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,139
Uncomfortable.

61
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:32,860
Uncomfortable.

62
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,479
Inconvenience.

63
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:36,199
And our third word is...

64
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:37,639
Postpone.

65
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:38,979
Postpone.

66
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:40,659
Postpone.

67
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:41,180
Postpone.

68
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,539
We have some examples of the word postpone that will help you to understand its meaning a little bit better.

69
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,319
Let's listen.

70
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:49,180
Example one.

71
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,180
Since Robert is late again, we have to postpone the meeting.

72
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,879
Example two.

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,800
I'm sorry, Simon, but your vacation has been postponed until next month.

74
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,139
Example three.

75
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,780
Unfortunately, the flight will be postponed.

76
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,400
Okay, so basically postpone is to delay.

77
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,219
That's right.

78
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,780
Make it at a later time.

79
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,620
At a later time.

80
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:29,979
Okay, some great words there and we can listen to our dialogue a second time at a slower speed.

81
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,620
Hello, Samantha speaking.

82
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,360
Hi, Samantha.

83
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,300
This is Angela calling.

84
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, hi, Angela.

85
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:46,819
What's up?

86
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

87
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,479
I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

88
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,300
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,939
Let me see.

90
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,680
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

91
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,460
I'm really sorry.

92
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,139
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,060
It's just this thing came up and...

94
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,240
Angela, you know what?

95
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,459
I can't make it to our meeting either.

96
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,899
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

97
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,339
Sounds great.

98
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,000
See you tomorrow.

99
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:29,240
Angela, Angela, look up.

100
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,959
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

101
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,800
Isn't that Samantha?

102
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,220
What?

103
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,620
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

104
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,189
Oh, no, I think she saw me.

105
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,339
All right, so in this dialogue, we had some really great phrases that we should look at in Fluency Builder.

106
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:57,379
Fluency Builder.

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,540
We have three phrases for you today in Fluency Builder, and the first one is so common.

108
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,720
It's a great phrase.

109
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:04,860
What's up?

110
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,040
What's up?

111
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,860
What's up?

112
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,660
So this is a very common way of saying hi.

113
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,259
Yeah.

114
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:11,879
What's up?

115
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:12,819
How's it going?

116
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,680
What's going on?

117
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,139
Right, and now the interesting thing is that many people don't know how to answer this phrase.

118
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,480
Yes, I see this all the time with my students.

119
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,779
So if you say what's up, you should say...

120
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:23,139
Not much.

121
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:23,920
Not much.

122
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:24,459
Nothing.

123
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,139
Nothing.

124
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,060
So what's up?

125
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,939
Not much.

126
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,579
Not much.

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,360
All right, so the next time someone tells you what's up, now you know what to answer.

128
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:32,899
Yeah.

129
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:36,480
Okay, our second phrase is can't make it.

130
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:36,839
Can't make it.

131
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,000
Can't make it.

132
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,420
I can't make it.

133
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,639
We use this phrase when we want to say, I cannot attend.

134
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:43,819
I cannot make it.

135
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:44,800
Yeah, I can't come.

136
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,360
Right, so if you're having a party today, I say, oh, I'm sorry, I can't make it.

137
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,040
It means I can't go.

138
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:51,699
Exactly.

139
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,800
Maybe one more example.

140
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,560
So Marco, we've got a meeting today at three o'clock.

141
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,259
I can't make it.

142
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,220
I'm recording today.

143
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,100
Oh, okay.

144
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,500
So can't make it.

145
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,620
Our last word for Fluency Builder.

146
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,300
This thing came up.

147
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,980
This thing came up.

148
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,939
This thing came up.

149
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,379
This is a great way of giving an excuse for why you can't make it.

150
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:13,720
Right.

151
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,459
So I can't make it today because this thing came up like something.

152
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,540
Something happened.

153
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,220
Something happened.

154
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,300
Yeah, let's listen to a few examples of this phrase so we can see how it's used in the wild.

155
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,779
Example one.

156
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:29,519
I'm sorry that I'm late.

157
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,379
This thing came up at work and I had to stay to take care of it.

158
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,680
Example two.

159
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
I can't talk right now.

160
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,879
Something came up.

161
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:44,819
Example three.

162
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,300
Sorry I missed the meeting.

163
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,339
Something came up.

164
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,980
Okay, great example and I guess it's perfectly clear now.

165
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,379
Yes.

166
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,920
So let's listen to our dialogue a third time and now we're ready to understand everything.

167
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,779
Hello, Samantha speaking.

168
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,360
Hi Samantha, this is Angela calling.

169
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,920
Oh hi Angela, what's up?

170
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,279
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

171
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,639
I wonder is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

172
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,019
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

173
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,399
Let me see.

174
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,060
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

175
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,600
I'm really sorry.

176
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,439
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

177
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,959
It's just this thing came up and...

178
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,939
Angela, you know what?

179
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,360
I can't make it to our meeting either.

180
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,480
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

181
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,420
Sounds great.

182
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,399
See you tomorrow.

183
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,600
Angela?

184
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:46,220
Angela, look up.

185
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,920
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

186
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,139
Isn't that Samantha?

187
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:50,980
What?

188
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,279
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

189
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,439
Oh no, I think she saw me.

190
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:06,199
So Erika, have you ever cancelled an appointment like this under false pretenses?

191
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:09,540
So for a fake reason?

192
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:10,540
For a fake reason?

193
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,680
To go shopping?

194
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:20,439
Well I may not have told my boss so I can't make it to a meeting because this thing came up and then I really was going shopping.

195
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,699
I've never done that.

196
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:22,600
But how about you Marco?

197
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,579
Well you know in Ecuador, soccer is a really big thing.

198
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:25,959
Right.

199
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,439
So when we were playing in the World Cup, Ecuador was playing and...

200
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,220
Not you, but...

201
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,200
Well no, like the Ecuadorian soccer team.

202
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,960
I cancelled an appointment because I was going to go watch the game.

203
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,299
Really?

204
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,100
A business appointment?

205
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,179
A business appointment.

206
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,580
Well I guess that's okay.

207
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:50,340
Yeah I mean it was like the first time we were ever in the World Cup and you know my boss didn't really put up much of a fight because I guess he also wanted to go watch the game.

208
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,259
So very similar to the events in this dialogue.

209
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:54,240
Very similar.

210
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,080
I guess that's kind of the inspiration behind it.

211
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,879
Alright guys I hope you found some of these phrases helpful and useful.

Bye!
