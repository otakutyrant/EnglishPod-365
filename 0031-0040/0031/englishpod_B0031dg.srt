EnglishPod.com Hello, Samantha speaking.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hi, Samantha.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is Angela calling.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, hi, Angela.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What's up?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let me see.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm really sorry.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's just this thing came up and...

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Angela, you know what?

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I can't make it to our meeting either.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Sounds great.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
See you tomorrow.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Angela?

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Angela, look up.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Isn't that Samantha?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What?

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, no.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I think she saw me.
