EnglishPod.com Hello, Samantha speaking.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,199
Hi, Samantha.

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,519
This is Angela calling.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,560
Oh, hi, Angela.

5
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:16,059
What's up?

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,460
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,800
I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,339
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,539
Let me see.

10
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:29,219
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

11
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:30,739
I'm really sorry.

12
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,600
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,179
It's just this thing came up and...

14
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:37,100
Angela, you know what?

15
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:38,520
I can't make it to our meeting either.

16
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:41,640
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

17
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:42,579
Sounds great.

18
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:43,600
See you tomorrow.

19
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:46,780
Angela?

20
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,380
Angela, look up.

21
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,079
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

22
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,299
Isn't that Samantha?

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,140
What?

24
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,439
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

25
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,320
Oh, no.

26
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,679
I think she saw me.
