00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Next, please.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
May I help you, sir?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'd like to open a bank account.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Certainly.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I can help you with that.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What type of account would you like to open, a checking or a saving account?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What features do they offer?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, if you just take a look here, see, with our checking account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And our savings account has a higher interest rate, but you must carry a minimum balance of $10,000.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I see.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'd like to have easy access to my money.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All right, then.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
With this checking account, you'll be issued a debit card and a checkbook.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Will you require overdraft protection?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There is an extra fee for that.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
No, that won't be necessary.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you could just sign here and here and here, we'll be all set.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Would you like to make a deposit today?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'd like to deposit $1 billion.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
One billion dollars!

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hahahahahahahaha!

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hahahahahaha!

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
One billion dollars!

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hahahahahaha!

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
One billion!
