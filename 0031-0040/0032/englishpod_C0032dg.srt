1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,740
Next, please.

2
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:10,900
May I help you, sir?

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,419
Hello.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,259
Yes.

5
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:15,039
I'd like to open a bank account.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,179
Certainly.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,760
I can help you with that.

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,679
What type of account would you like to open, a checking or a saving account?

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,280
What features do they offer?

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,600
Well, if you just take a look here, see, with our checking account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee.

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,600
And our savings account has a higher interest rate, but you must carry a minimum balance of $10,000.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,000
I see.

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,159
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

14
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,600
I'd like to have easy access to my money.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,479
All right, then.

16
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,320
With this checking account, you'll be issued a debit card and a checkbook.

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,979
Will you require overdraft protection?

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,079
There is an extra fee for that.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,579
No, that won't be necessary.

20
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,399
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

21
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:03,179
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

22
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,200
If you could just sign here and here and here, we'll be all set.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,379
Would you like to make a deposit today?

24
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:16,739
Yes.

25
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,599
I'd like to deposit $1 billion.

26
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,260
One billion dollars!
