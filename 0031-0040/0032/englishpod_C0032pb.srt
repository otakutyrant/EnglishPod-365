00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're bringing you another great lesson about being at the bank.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We've got an intermediate lesson for you today with lots of great language to help you open a bank account.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, so let's look at our vocabulary preview today.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Two words today.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The first one is checking accounts.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A checking account.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Checking accounts.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So what is a checking account?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well it's a type of bank account that lets you do your day-to-day or daily banking.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So it's the normal bank account that you use to go shopping, that you use to pay your bills.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yep, exactly.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The opposite, and our second word is?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Savings account.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A savings account.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Savings account.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So a savings account is to?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's a bank account where you save your money.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
To save money, right?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So usually you don't touch the money in this account.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, usually it stays in there.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Right, so usually banks will have these two types of accounts.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Checking and savings.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Uh-huh.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, great.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's listen to our dialogue a first time now.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Right, well today we're at a bank and we're going to listen as a man is opening a bank account.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The dialogue is going to be spoken at a normal speed, so it might be a little bit fast.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But don't worry about it because we'll come back and explain everything.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you could just sign here, and here, and here, we'll be all set.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Would you like to make a deposit today?

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes, I'd like to deposit one billion dollars.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
One billion dollars.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
One billion dollars.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
All right, one billion dollars.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's a lot of money.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's a weird laugh.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, let's look at language takeaway today.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Language takeaway.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Today we've got four words for you in language takeaway all about money and banking.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Money and banking.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Uh-huh.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The first one that we have today is transaction.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Transaction.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
A transaction.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So we have some great examples that will help you understand what a transaction is, so let's listen.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Example one.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I need a record of my most recent bank transactions.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Example two.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There is no fee for bank transactions done online.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Example three.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay, we've deposited your money.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Would you like to make another transaction today?

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So basically, I can understand that a transaction is moving money around in your bank accounts.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right, it's taking your money from, right, it's taking money from your bank account and putting it in another account or just taking it to spend, whatever.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's a transaction.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Or even putting money into your bank account.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's also a transaction.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Great.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Our second word, balance.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Balance.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Your account balance is how much money you have.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Exactly.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Right?

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
An account balance.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
My account balance is $2 right now, I think.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's a bit of a problem.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Good thing payday is three days away.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah, my God.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay, our third word, overdraft.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Overdraft.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Overdraft.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Overdraft.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So this really comes in handy, right?

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
To overdraft, can you tell us a little bit about it?

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's say in my bank account, I have $500, but I spend $600, right?

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So I have an overdraft in my account, meaning I owe the bank $100.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Right.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's also commonly referred to as a negative balance.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's right.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Negative balance.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Like me.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Very soon, I will have a negative balance.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think this one is a little bit tricky to understand.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So let's listen to a couple of examples of how we use this word.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Example one.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The maximum overdraft on my account is only $5,000.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Example two.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry, sir, but you've exceeded your maximum overdraft limit.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I cannot give you any more money.

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Example three.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh no, I have to pay $1,500 in overdraft fees.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay, great examples.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now we can take a look at our last word, debit card.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Debit card.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Debit card.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
debit card.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So a debit card is issued by the bank and used to ...

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Take money out of an ATM...

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
From an ATM machine, right?

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
A debit card.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Not to be confused with a credit card.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Not the same thing.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay, great.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So now we could listen to our dialogue a second time at a slower speed, so now we can...

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You can hear all of the great language you just talked about.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Next, please.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
May I help you, sir?

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hello, yes.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'd like to open a bank account.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Certainly.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I can help you with that.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What type of account would you like to open?

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A checking or a savings account?

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What features do they offer?

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well, if you just look hereâ€¦ see, with our checking account you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee and our savings account has a higher interest rate.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But you must carry a minimum balance of $10,000.

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I see.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I like to have easy access to my money.

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Alright then.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
With this checking account you'll be issued with a debit card and a checkbook.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Will you require overdraft protection?

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There is an extra fee for that.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No, that won't be necessary.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you could just sign here and here and here, we'll be all set.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Would you like to make a deposit today?

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes, I'd like to deposit $1 billion dollars!

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We heard some interesting phrases of how to tell somebody to do something in a polite way.

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So let's start with Fluency Builder and explain these words.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The bank teller asked this man to do a number of things in order to open his bank account and she used some great expressions.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Right, let's listen to how she asked the man to do some things in a polite way.

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So the first thing she said is, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll get you to.

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Right, right, I'll get you to.

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So it's just a way of saying, can you please fill this out?

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, do this.

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Do this, but in a different way, right?

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
More polite.

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's pretty polite.

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Then she also said, I'll need your social insurance number.

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll need your.

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll need your.

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Again, a polite way of saying.

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Give me your social insurance number.

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Give me your social insurance.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And the last thing she said, and this is really polite, if you could just sign here.

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If you could just sign here.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
If you could just.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If you could just wait a moment, I'll be with you.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If you could just send me an email with your bank account number.

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Right.

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Very polite way of asking for something.

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yep.

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, some great language in today's cast.

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll catch all of this wonderful language.

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Next, please.

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
May I help you, sir?

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hello.

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes, I'd like to open a bank account.

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Certainly.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can help you with that.

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What type of account would you like to open?

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
A checking or saving account?

179
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What features do they offer?

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, if you just take a look here.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
See, with our checking account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And our savings account has a higher interest rate, but you must carry a minimum balance of $10,000.

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I see.

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'd like to have easy access to my money.

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
All right, then.

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
With this checking account, you'll be issued a debit card and a checkbook.

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Will you require overdraft protection?

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There is an extra fee for that.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
No, that won't be necessary.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If you could just sign here and here and here, we'll be all set.

194
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Would you like to make a deposit today?

195
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes, I'd like to deposit one billion dollars.

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
One billion dollars.

197
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:58,000
OK, so an interesting thing here, not many countries use checks.

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's right.

199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Right.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The checkbook or a check.

201
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah, it tends to be more of an American thing, don't you think?

202
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It is.

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It is.

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I think it is.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
For those of you who aren't sure what a check is, it's basically a piece of paper that you just sign your name and.

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, you write the amount of money and then you sign your name, right?

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Right.

208
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And then you give that to the person that that person can take it to the bank and get money in exchange for.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes.

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's not very common in other countries.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, but from what I know, every single American has a checkbook and uses it.

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Right.

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Pretty regularly.

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah.

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
For example, you pay your phone bill or your electric bill.

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Just put a check in the mailbox and it's done.

217
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's an interesting thing.

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Also, sometimes in other countries, people's salaries are paid through checks.

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Paycheck.

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, yes.

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I see where that word comes from.

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Paycheck.

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But for example, here in China, it's not very common, right?

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I've never seen a check here.

225
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Me neither.

226
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What about in your countries?

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We'd like to know how the banking system works.

228
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes.

229
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Come to our website at EnglishPod.com and tell us all about it.

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes.

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah.

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000

234
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But until then, it's goodbye.
