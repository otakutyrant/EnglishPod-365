00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello English learners, welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,259
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,240
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,359
And today we're bringing you another great lesson about being at the bank.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,019
That's right.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,780
We've got an intermediate lesson for you today with lots of great language to help you open a bank account.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,019
Okay, so let's look at our vocabulary preview today.

8
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,239
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,000
Two words today.

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,440
The first one is checking accounts.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,579
A checking account.

12
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:31,699
Checking accounts.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,979
So what is a checking account?

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,100
Well it's a type of bank account that lets you do your day-to-day or daily banking.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,500
So it's the normal bank account that you use to go shopping, that you use to pay your bills.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,579
Yep, exactly.

17
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,979
The opposite, and our second word is?

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,579
Savings account.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,859
A savings account.

20
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,000
Savings account.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,060
So a savings account is to?

22
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,500
It's a bank account where you save your money.

23
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:58,820
To save money, right?

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,259
So usually you don't touch the money in this account.

25
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:03,280
Yeah, usually it stays in there.

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,019
Right, so usually banks will have these two types of accounts.

27
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:07,359
Yes.

28
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,379
Checking and savings.

29
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:08,799
Uh-huh.

30
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:09,819
Okay, great.

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,760
Let's listen to our dialogue a first time now.

32
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,459
Right, well today we're at a bank and we're going to listen as a man is opening a bank account.

33
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,140
The dialogue is going to be spoken at a normal speed, so it might be a little bit fast.

34
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:21,500
Yeah.

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,859
But don't worry about it because we'll come back and explain everything.

36
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:25,200
Yes.

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,319
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

38
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:38,319
If you could just sign here, and here, and here, we'll be all set.

39
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,479
Would you like to make a deposit today?

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,439
Yes, I'd like to deposit one billion dollars!

41
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,099
One billion dollars!

42
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:53,219
Hahahahahaha!

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,539
Hahahahahaha!

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,479
Hmmm...

45
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:02,719
Music Alright, one billion dollars.

46
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,060
That's a lot of money!

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,319
That's a weird laugh.

48
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:10,180
Hahaha Okay, let's look at language takeaway today.

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,680
Language takeaway.

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,960
Today we've got four words for you in language takeaway, all about money and banking.

51
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:19,819
Money and banking.

52
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,159
The first one that we have today is transaction.

53
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,340
Transaction.

54
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,759
A transaction.

55
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,479
So we have some great examples that will help you understand what a transaction is, so let's listen.

56
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,819
Example one.

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,780
I need a record of my most recent bank transactions.

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,580
Example two.

59
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,719
Example three.

60
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:52,159
There is no fee for bank transactions done online.

61
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,740
Example three.

62
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,400
Okay, we've deposited your money.

63
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,379
Would you like to make another transaction today?

64
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:13,500
So basically I can understand that a transaction is moving money around in your bank account.

65
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:22,439
Right, it's taking money from your bank account and putting it in another account or just taking it to spend, whatever.

66
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:22,879
Yes.

67
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,899
That's a transaction.

68
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:26,079
Or even putting money into your bank account.

69
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,019
That's also a transaction.

70
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,220
Great!

71
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,540
Our second word.

72
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:30,439
Balance.

73
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,420
Balance.

74
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,600
Balance.

75
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,180
Balance.

76
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,720
Your account balance is how much money you have.

77
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,240
Exactly.

78
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:38,839
Right?

79
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,779
An account balance.

80
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,339
My account balance is $2 right now, I think.

81
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,920
That's a bit of a problem.

82
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:45,579
Yes.

83
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:47,420
Good thing payday is three days away.

84
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,500
Yeah, my God.

85
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,160
Okay, our third word.

86
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,120
Overdraft.

87
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,439
Overdraft.

88
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:54,680
Overdraft.

89
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:55,480
Overdraft.

90
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,540
So this really comes in handy, right?

91
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,100
Mm-hmm.

92
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,720
To overdraft, can you tell us a little bit about it?

93
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,019
Let's say in my bank account I have $500, but I spend $600.

94
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,000
Right.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,519
So I have an overdraft in my account, meaning I owe the bank $100.

96
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:14,800
Right.

97
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:18,079
It's also commonly referred to as a negative balance.

98
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:18,699
That's right.

99
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:19,779
Negative balance.

100
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,259
Like me.

101
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,920
Very soon I will have a negative balance.

102
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,040
Okay, I think this one is a little bit tricky to understand, so let's listen to a couple of examples of how we use this word.

103
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,980
Example one.

104
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,600
The maximum overdraft on my account is only $5,000.

105
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:42,959
Example two.

106
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,019
I'm sorry, sir, but you've exceeded your maximum overdraft limit.

107
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,019
I cannot give you any more money.

108
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,600
Example three.

109
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:06,300
Oh no, I have to pay $1,500 in overdraft fees.

110
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,819
Okay, great examples.

111
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,579
Now we can take a look at our last word.

112
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:14,779
Debit card.

113
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,959
Debit card.

114
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,279
Debit card.

115
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,699
D-E-B-I-T card.

116
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,579
Debit card.

117
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,060
So a debit card is issued by the bank.

118
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,420
Yes.

119
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,939
And used to?

120
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,319
Take money out of an ATM.

121
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,319
From an ATM machine, right?

122
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:29,620
Right.

123
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,519
A debit card.

124
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,699
Not to be confused with a credit card.

125
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:33,600
Not the same thing.

126
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:34,199
Okay.

127
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:41,180
Okay, great, so now we could listen to our dialogue a second time at a slower speed, so now we can...

128
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,699
We can hear all of the great language you just talked about.

129
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,379
Next, please.

130
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,879
May I help you, sir?

131
00:06:58,339 --> 00:06:59,459
Hello, yes.

132
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,860
I'd like to open a bank account.

133
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,240
Certainly.

134
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,120
I can help you with that.

135
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,160
What type of account would you like to open?

136
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,439
A checking or a savings account?

137
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,060
What features do they offer?

138
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:27,079
Well, if you just look here, see, with our checking account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee, and our savings account has a higher interest rate.

139
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,860
But you must carry a minimum balance of $10,000.

140
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,019
I see.

141
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:38,040
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

142
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,379
I like to have easy access to my money.

143
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,339
Alright, then.

144
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,899
With this checking account, you'll be issued with a debit card and a chequebook.

145
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,560
Will you require overdraft protection?

146
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,319
There is an extra fee for that.

147
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,480
No, that won't be necessary.

148
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:01,339
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

149
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,680
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

150
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,620
If you could just sign here, and here, and here, we'll be all set.

151
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,259
Would you like to make a deposit today?

152
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,399
Yes, I'd like to deposit one billion dollars!

153
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,580
We heard some interesting phrases of how to tell somebody to do something in a polite way.

154
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:35,080
Yes.

155
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,740
So, let's start with fluency builder and explain these words.

156
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,779
Fluency builder.

157
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:49,100
The bank teller asked this man to do a number of things in order to open his bank account, and she used some great expressions.

158
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,980
Right, let's listen to how she asked the man to do some things in a polite way.

159
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,340
Yes.

160
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:58,700
I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

161
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,019
I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

162
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,820
I'll need your social insurance number.

163
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,779
I'll need your social insurance number.

164
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:15,440
If you could just sign here.

165
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,120
If you could just sign here.

166
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:24,940
So the first thing she said is, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

167
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:26,799
I'll get you to.

168
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:29,259
Right, right, I'll get you to.

169
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,460
So it's just a way of saying, can you please fill this out?

170
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,440
Yeah, do this.

171
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,159
Do this, but in a different way, right?

172
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,179
More polite.

173
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:38,179
It's pretty polite.

174
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,139
Then she also said, I'll need your social insurance number.

175
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,120
I'll need your...

176
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,299
I'll need your...

177
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,120
Again, a polite way of saying...

178
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,320
Give me your social insurance number.

179
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,919
Give me your social insurance.

180
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,279
And the last thing she said, and this is really polite.

181
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,539
If you could just sign here.

182
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,139
Yes.

183
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:00,120
If you could just sign here.

184
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,120
If you could just...

185
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,519
If you could just wait a moment, I'll be with you.

186
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,879
If you could just send me an email with your bank account number.

187
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:08,720
Right.

188
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,799
Very polite way of asking for something.

189
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,759
Well, some great language in today's cast.

190
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,940
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll catch all of this wonderful language.

191
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:28,679
Next, please.

192
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,919
May I help you, sir?

193
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,179
Hello, yes.

194
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,000
I'd like to open a bank account.

195
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,080
Certainly.

196
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,720
I can help you with that.

197
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,940
What type of account would you like to open?

198
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,659
A checking or a saving account?

199
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,240
What features do they offer?

200
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,120
Well, if you just take a look here.

201
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,559
See, with our checking account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee.

202
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:52,419
And our savings account has a higher interest rate.

203
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,539
But you must carry a minimum balance of $10,000.

204
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:56,960
I see.

205
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:00,120
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

206
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,539
I'd like to have easy access to my money.

207
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,440
All right, then.

208
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,279
With this checking account, you'll be issued a debit card and a checkbook.

209
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,919
Will you require overdraft protection?

210
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,080
There is an extra fee for that.

211
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,539
No, that won't be necessary.

212
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,340
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

213
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,100
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

214
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,139
If you could just sign here and here and here, we'll be all set.

215
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,320
Would you like to make a deposit today?

216
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,220
Yes, I'd like to deposit one billion dollars.

217
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:44,960
One billion dollars!

218
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,419
Okay, so an interesting thing here.

219
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,379
Not many countries use checks.

220
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,340
That's right.

221
00:11:59,720 --> 00:11:59,860
Right?

222
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,139
The checkbook or a check?

223
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,659
Yeah, it tends to be more of an American thing, don't you think?

224
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,960
It is, it is.

225
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,559
I think it is.

226
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,200
For those of you who aren't sure what a check is, it's basically a checkbook.

227
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,639
It's basically a piece of paper that you just sign your name and...

228
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,179
Yeah, you write the amount of money and then you sign your name, right?

229
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,799
Right, and then you give that to the person.

230
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,840
That person can take it to the bank and get money in exchange for it.

231
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,340
It's not very common in other countries.

232
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,980
No, but from what I know, every single American has a checkbook and uses it pretty regularly.

233
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:32,379
For example, you pay your phone bill or your electric bill.

234
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:34,759
You just put a check in the mailbox and it's paid.

235
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,279
And it's done.

236
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:36,940
It's an interesting thing.

237
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,519
Also, sometimes in other countries, people's salaries are paid through checks.

238
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,600
Paycheck.

239
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,539
Oh, yes!

240
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,480
I see where that word comes from.

241
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,320
Paycheck.

242
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,220
But for example, here in China it's not very common, right?

243
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,700
I've never seen a check here.

244
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,179
Me neither.

245
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,460
What about in your countries?

246
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,759
We'd like to know how the banking system works.

247
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,940
Yes, come to our website at EnglishPod.com and tell us all about it.

248
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,440
Yes, and you can also leave your questions and comments on our website and we'll be there to answer it.

249
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:06,679
Yeah, Marco and I love answering your questions, so please visit us.

250
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,840
Right, but until then, it's… Bye!
