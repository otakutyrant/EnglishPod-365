00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:02,319
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,799
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:04,559
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,839
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,160
And we're bringing you another great elementary lesson today, one that takes place at the office.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:11,919
Yes.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,539
Today we're going to teach you some great phrases so that you can ask people to help you.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:17,960
Right.

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,780
And I think this dialogue is with a new person at the office.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,859
So when you're new, you always need to ask people for favors.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,480
Exactly.

12
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:25,160
Okay.

13
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,980
So we're going to be asking for a favor.

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,420
So Marco, what exactly is a favor?

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,060
Something that a person does for you.

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,079
Like a small helpful thing.

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,700
Yeah, a small helpful thing.

18
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,840
So, you know, like, can you pass me that pencil?

19
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,119
Maybe that's even a favor.

20
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:41,560
Yeah.

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,700
Or maybe, can you pick me up on your way to work?

22
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:45,700
Yeah, that's a favor.

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,520
Or even lending money to your friend.

24
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:49,359
That's a favor.

25
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:49,740
Yeah.

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,320
So that's what we're going to be talking about, favors and how to ask for one.

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,219
Because you always have to do this at work.

28
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,600
At work, with your friends, with your family.

29
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,840
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain all the vocabulary.

30
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:43,439
Actually, I'm working on a document that's due in a couple of minutes.

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,560
I really can't talk right now.

32
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:45,480
Sorry about that.

33
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,879
Geez, I just want to know where the bathroom is.

34
00:01:53,379 --> 00:02:03,019
What's going on?

35
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,180
So a pretty busy office.

36
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,739
Pretty unhelpful colleagues.

37
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,800
I know, everyone's so busy they didn't help this poor girl.

38
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,439
Yeah, I hope she found the bathroom.

39
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:16,520
Now let's take a look at the language from the dialogue.

40
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,740
So let's start with language takeaway.

41
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,340
Language in this dialogue, wasn't there?

42
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,159
Yeah, a lot of interesting phrases and words.

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,060
The first one that I saw that was really interesting is on board.

44
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,300
On board.

45
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:34,719
Welcome on board.

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,240
Well, we've got some examples of how this phrase is used.

47
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,500
So let's listen to them to help us understand the meaning.

48
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,439
Example one.

49
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:46,819
Welcome on board, Sarah.

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,979
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

51
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,939
Example two.

52
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,039
We need to get our new office assistant on board as soon as possible.

53
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,240
Example three.

54
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:12,080
We decided to bring Melissa on board to join the marketing team.

55
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,520
So basically it means welcome to the company.

56
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,219
Welcome to the company or the team.

57
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:22,719
Yeah.

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,840
Welcome on board.

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,740
So on board is the same as to the company.

60
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,699
I guess also when you get on a ship, they'll tell you welcome on board.

61
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:31,039
Yes.

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,419
That's where it comes from.

63
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,139
Or an airplane.

64
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:33,539
Yeah.

65
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:33,759
Yeah.

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:33,979
Yeah.

67
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:34,620
Welcome on board.

68
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,159
Okay, let's take a look at our next word.

69
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:38,460
About to.

70
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,580
About to.

71
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,740
I'm about to.

72
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,219
I'm about to.

73
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:48,360
So this is a great phrase to explain that you're about to do something.

74
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,199
I'm going to do this thing really soon.

75
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,379
Okay, so for example, you can say, I'm about to go out for lunch.

76
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:00,520
Or I could say, hey Marco, let's go record a show.

77
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,439
I'm about to go into a meeting.

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,259
Exactly.

79
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,020
About to.

80
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,039
Going to do something really soon.

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Okay.

82
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,319
The next word we have is instead.

83
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:11,719
Instead.

84
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:12,740
Instead.

85
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:13,599
Instead.

86
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,339
It means in the place of.

87
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,139
In the place of.

88
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,399
Yep.

89
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:23,040
So for example, if we're at dinner I could say, I'll have the chicken instead of the fish.

90
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:24,379
Right.

91
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,600
Or I can say, I wanted to buy a red sweater but they didn't have one so I bought a blue one instead.

92
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,199
Instead.

93
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

94
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,819
So in the place of.

95
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,199
Yep.

96
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,000
And our last word for language takeaway.

97
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:39,220
Interrupt.

98
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,259
Interrupt.

99
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,379
Interrupt.

100
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,079
Interrupt.

101
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,600
So when somebody interrupts you they come in and.

102
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,540
They talk to you while you're doing something or maybe while you're speaking.

103
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,500
Or maybe you're busy and people come and.

104
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,220
Bother you.

105
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:54,839
Bother you.

106
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:55,139
Yeah.

107
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:55,800
Okay.

108
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:56,839
So interrupt.

109
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,600
Interrupt.

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,459
Okay, some great words here in our dialogue and now we can listen to it again.

111
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,579
This time it's going to be a little bit slower.

112
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,379
And you'll be able to understand the language a little bit better.

113
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:17,779
Um.

114
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,620
Sorry to bother you.

115
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:20,620
Um.

116
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,300
My name is Rachel.

117
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,439
I'm new here.

118
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,839
Can I ask you for a favor?

119
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:27,540
Hi Rachel.

120
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,019
Welcome on board.

121
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,980
I'm afraid I can't help you right now.

122
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,620
I'm getting ready for a very important meeting.

123
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,600
Excuse me.

124
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,899
But can I bother you for a second?

125
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,839
You know what?

126
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,439
I'd love to help you.

127
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,339
But I'm about to meet an important client.

128
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,980
Do you want to try Sean instead?

129
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,000
He sits right over there.

130
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:53,879
Sorry to interrupt you Sean.

131
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,600
Could you do me a quick favor?

132
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,860
Actually I'm working on a document that is due in a couple of minutes.

133
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,259
I really can't talk to you right now.

134
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:04,920
Sorry about that.

135
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,519
Geez.

136
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:11,720
I just want to know where the bathroom is.

137
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:18,860
What's up?

138
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:23,079
Okay so there are some great ways that you can ask someone for a favor right?

139
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah we want to show you some really useful phrases for asking for help.

140
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,920
So let's start with putting it together.

141
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,160
Putting it together.

142
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,839
Let's listen to some different ways of how you can ask someone for a favor.

143
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,139
Example one.

144
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,319
May I get you to do me a favor?

145
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,279
Can you carry this package in your suitcase for me?

146
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,819
Example two.

147
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,879
Can I ask you a favor?

148
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,139
Can you just finish this report for me?

149
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,040
Example three.

150
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,959
Will you do me a favor and pass me that file?

151
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,759
Okay so those were great examples of asking for a favor.

152
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,920
In our dialogue we heard can I ask you a favor?

153
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,860
But we could also say can I get you to do me a favor?

154
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,019
Right can I get you to do me a favor?

155
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,279
Also I could say will you do me a favor?

156
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,519
Will you do me a favor?

157
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,160
Right so those are different ways of asking for a favor.

158
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,259
Let's say you want to ask someone for a favor right?

159
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,120
Mm-hmm.

160
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,040
But they're busy right?

161
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,560
So you'll need some phrases to help you do this.

162
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:45,240
Exactly you need some phrases to interrupt somebody.

163
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:45,560
Uh-huh.

164
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,360
Right so let's listen to some examples of what phrases you can use to begin to talk to someone.

165
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,500
Yeah to interrupt them.

166
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,060
Okay.

167
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,740
I hate to bother you but.

168
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,779
I hate to bother you but.

169
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,639
I'm sorry to bother you but.

170
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,480
I'm sorry to bother you but.

171
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,660
I don't mean to bother you but.

172
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:12,459
I don't mean to bother you but.

173
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,980
Okay so those are really nice and polite ways of beginning to talk to someone.

174
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,240
Exactly they're really useful at the office.

175
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:30,699
So maybe you want to talk to your boss you knock on his door kind of open it a little bit and say I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you have time for a meeting today?

176
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,339
Mm-hmm.

177
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,899
Or you could say I hate to bother you but do you have time for a meeting today?

178
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:37,899
Exactly.

179
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:38,379
Mm-hmm.

180
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,240
So those are great ways of starting up a conversation.

181
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:41,539
Yep.

182
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,460
And maybe setting it up to ask for a favor.

183
