00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And we're bringing you another great elementary lesson today, one that takes place at the office.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we're going to teach you some great phrases so that you can ask people to help you.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Right.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I think this dialogue is with a new person at the office.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So when you're new, you always need to ask people for favors.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Exactly.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So we're going to be asking for a favor.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So Marco, what exactly is a favor?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Something that a person does for you.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Like a small helpful thing.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah, a small helpful thing.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, you know, like, can you pass me that pencil?

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Maybe that's even a favor.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Or maybe, can you pick me up on your way to work?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah, that's a favor.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Or even lending money to your friend.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's a favor.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So that's what we're going to be talking about, favors and how to ask for one.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Because you always have to do this at work.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
At work, with your friends, with your family.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain all the vocabulary.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Actually, I'm working on a document that's due in a couple of minutes.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I really can't talk right now.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sorry about that.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Geez, I just want to know where the bathroom is.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What's going on?

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So a pretty busy office.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Pretty unhelpful colleagues.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I know, everyone's so busy they didn't help this poor girl.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, I hope she found the bathroom.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now let's take a look at the language from the dialogue.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So let's start with language takeaway.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Language in this dialogue, wasn't there?

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, a lot of interesting phrases and words.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The first one that I saw that was really interesting is on board.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
On board.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Welcome on board.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, we've got some examples of how this phrase is used.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So let's listen to them to help us understand the meaning.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Example one.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Welcome on board, Sarah.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Example two.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We need to get our new office assistant on board as soon as possible.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Example three.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We decided to bring Melissa on board to join the marketing team.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So basically it means welcome to the company.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Welcome to the company or the team.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Welcome on board.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So on board is the same as to the company.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I guess also when you get on a ship, they'll tell you welcome on board.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's where it comes from.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Or an airplane.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Welcome on board.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay, let's take a look at our next word.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
About to.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
About to.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm about to.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm about to.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So this is a great phrase to explain that you're about to do something.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm going to do this thing really soon.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay, so for example, you can say, I'm about to go out for lunch.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Or I could say, hey Marco, let's go record a show.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm about to go into a meeting.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Exactly.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
About to.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Going to do something really soon.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The next word we have is instead.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Instead.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Instead.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Instead.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It means in the place of.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In the place of.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yep.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So for example, if we're at dinner I could say, I'll have the chicken instead of the fish.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Right.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Or I can say, I wanted to buy a red sweater but they didn't have one so I bought a blue one instead.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Instead.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So in the place of.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yep.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And our last word for language takeaway.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Interrupt.

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Interrupt.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Interrupt.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Interrupt.

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So when somebody interrupts you they come in and.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They talk to you while you're doing something or maybe while you're speaking.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Or maybe you're busy and people come and.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Bother you.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Bother you.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So interrupt.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Interrupt.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay, some great words here in our dialogue and now we can listen to it again.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This time it's going to be a little bit slower.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And you'll be able to understand the language a little bit better.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Um.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sorry to bother you.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Um.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
My name is Rachel.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm new here.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Can I ask you for a favor?

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hi Rachel.

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Welcome on board.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm afraid I can't help you right now.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm getting ready for a very important meeting.

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Excuse me.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But can I bother you for a second?

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You know what?

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'd love to help you.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But I'm about to meet an important client.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you want to try Sean instead?

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He sits right over there.

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Sorry to interrupt you Sean.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Could you do me a quick favor?

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Actually I'm working on a document that is due in a couple of minutes.

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I really can't talk to you right now.

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sorry about that.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Geez.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I just want to know where the bathroom is.

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What's up?

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay so there are some great ways that you can ask someone for a favor right?

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah we want to show you some really useful phrases for asking for help.

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So let's start with putting it together.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Putting it together.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's listen to some different ways of how you can ask someone for a favor.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Example one.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
May I get you to do me a favor?

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Can you carry this package in your suitcase for me?

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Example two.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Can I ask you a favor?

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Can you just finish this report for me?

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Example three.

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Will you do me a favor and pass me that file?

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay so those were great examples of asking for a favor.

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In our dialogue we heard can I ask you a favor?

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But we could also say can I get you to do me a favor?

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Right can I get you to do me a favor?

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Also I could say will you do me a favor?

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Will you do me a favor?

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Right so those are different ways of asking for a favor.

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's say you want to ask someone for a favor right?

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Mm-hmm.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But they're busy right?

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So you'll need some phrases to help you do this.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Exactly you need some phrases to interrupt somebody.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Uh-huh.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Right so let's listen to some examples of what phrases you can use to begin to talk to someone.

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah to interrupt them.

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I hate to bother you but.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I hate to bother you but.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry to bother you but.

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry to bother you but.

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't mean to bother you but.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't mean to bother you but.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay so those are really nice and polite ways of beginning to talk to someone.

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Exactly they're really useful at the office.

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So maybe you want to talk to your boss you knock on his door kind of open it a little bit and say I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you have time for a meeting today?

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mm-hmm.

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Or you could say I hate to bother you but do you have time for a meeting today?

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Exactly.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Mm-hmm.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So those are great ways of starting up a conversation.

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yep.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And maybe setting it up to ask for a favor.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
