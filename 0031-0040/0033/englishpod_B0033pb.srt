00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:02,439
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,980
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:04,740
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:05,679
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,199
And today we have another great elementary lesson for you all.

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:09,839
That's right.

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,539
We've got a lesson for all you sports fans out there.

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:12,960
Right.

9
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,080
We're doing a podcast on sports today.

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,339
We're starting off with basketball.

11
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:17,760
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:23,339
So we've got lots of language about basketball and sports in this lesson today.

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,140
Great.

14
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,379
So let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:30,320
Vocabulary Preview Two words for you today.

16
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,640
The first one is foul.

17
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:33,700
Foul.

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,219
Foul.

19
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:35,899
A foul.

20
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,060
Basically it's an action in a game that is not allowed.

21
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:40,539
Right.

22
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:43,439
So if you're playing basketball and you kick the other player.

23
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,259
That's a foul.

24
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:44,780
That's a foul.

25
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:45,719
That's a pretty big foul.

26
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:45,979
Yeah.

27
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,939
If you're playing soccer and you pick up the ball.

28
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,219
That's also a foul.

29
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:50,920
Uh-huh.

30
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,119
Our second word is ref.

31
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:53,939
Ref.

32
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:54,880
R-E-F.

33
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,600
Also known as a referee.

34
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,179
Uh-huh.

35
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:57,539
Right.

36
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,159
So a referee is...

37
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,880
Basically like the judge of a game.

38
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:02,880
The judge of the game.

39
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,020
Yeah.

40
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,420
So he's the one that will...

41
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,719
Say, that was a foul.

42
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,379
That was a foul.

43
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:06,900
Exactly.

44
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:07,620
Ref.

45
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,280
Also known as referee.

46
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:09,939
Okay.

47
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,480
So two great words.

48
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,159
We're going to hear them in our dialogue.

49
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,959
And we're going to be listening to two guys who are watching a basketball game on TV.

50
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,140
Hey, has the game started yet?

51
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:32,760
Yeah.

52
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,760
About five minutes ago.

53
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,459
Who's winning?

54
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:35,659
The Bulls, of course.

55
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:37,859
What?

56
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,159
That wasn't a foul.

57
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,500
Oh, come on, ref.

58
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,120
Don't worry.

59
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,540
Shaq always screws up free throws.

60
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,200
You were right.

61
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,400
He didn't make the shot.

62
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,200
Yeah.

63
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,180
That was a great shot.

64
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:54,640
Three pointer.

65
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:54,900
Yeah.

66
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,040
Did you see that?

67
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,420
He traveled to the ref.

68
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,280
Didn't even call it.

69
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,719
This ref needs glasses.

70
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,480
Hey, ref.

71
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,500
Open your eyes.

72
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,239
Can't believe he didn't see that.

73
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:05,480
Okay.

74
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:06,780
End of the first quarter.

75
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:07,659
All right.

76
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:08,560
I'm going to make a beer run.

77
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,740
All right.

78
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,740
A really common situation whenever you're watching games with friends, right?

79
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,680
You need to get a beer.

80
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,539
We'll talk about that in a little while.

81
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,900
Let's take a look at language takeaway.

82
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,699
Language takeaway.

83
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,300
Okay.

84
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,759
Let's take a look at our first word on language takeaway.

85
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,599
Free throw.

86
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,199
Free throw.

87
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:36,439
Free throw.

88
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:39,060
This one's a bit hard to say, isn't it?

89
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:46,139
It's a little bit hard to explain, but if you're playing basketball and if someone fouls you, you get a free throw.

90
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:51,379
So that's when all the players line up around you and you can throw the ball.

91
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,120
To the basket without anyone blocking you or anything.

92
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,419
Right.

93
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,379
A little bit complicated, but I'm sure the basketball fans understand what a free throw is.

94
00:02:59,819 --> 00:02:59,939
All right.

95
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,300
Our next word is?

96
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:02,560
Make the shot.

97
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,219
Make the shot.

98
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,819
Make the shot.

99
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:11,039
Let's listen to some examples and we'll understand the meaning of make the shot.

100
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:13,020
Example one.

101
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,180
I can't believe it.

102
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,199
He made the shot from the other side of the court.

103
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,900
Example two.

104
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,159
There's no way he's going to make that shot.

105
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,259
He's way too far away from the net.

106
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:35,860
Example three.

107
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:41,719
If Gretzky makes this shot, they're going to win the Stanley Cup.

108
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,120
So it's clear now to make the shot is to successfully put the ball in the basket.

109
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,919
You can use this expression in other sports as well, right?

110
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:55,500
Yeah, you can use it in hockey to make the shot.

111
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,919
You could also use it in golf.

112
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,879
In a lot of different sports they use the term to shoot.

113
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,259
Yes.

114
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:00,840
Shoot the ball.

115
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,120
So anytime you shoot the ball, you can make the shot.

116
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:03,780
Exactly.

117
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,840
Okay, our next word today, three pointer.

118
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,280
Three pointer.

119
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,979
Three pointer.

120
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,159
A three pointer.

121
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:14,639
It's a shot in basketball when you get three points.

122
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,060
Yes.

123
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,040
Usually this shot is taken from further out.

124
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,139
Yeah, farther distance.

125
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,240
Yeah, so it's a little bit more difficult to make this shot.

126
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,560
You know, sometimes people might say a three point shot or something like that, but our EnglishPod learners, they know.

127
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,040
It's a three pointer.

128
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,560
Yeah, you'll sound really knowledgeable, really cool using that one.

129
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:35,300
Three pointer.

130
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:38,800
And our last word today, travel.

131
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:39,680
Travel.

132
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:40,540
To travel.

133
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,139
Travel.

134
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:43,399
When you walk with the basketball.

135
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:47,220
Well, technically you're allowed to take two steps in basketball.

136
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:51,360
So when you take more than two steps, then it's traveling.

137
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:55,819
So, yeah, traveling means to take more than two steps with the ball.

138
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,160
Let's listen to the dialogue a second time.

139
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,259
This time it'll be a bit slower so that we can understand some of these great phrases we just talked about.

140
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:11,180
Hey, has the game started yet?

141
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,300
Yeah, about five minutes ago.

142
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,759
Oh, who's winning?

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,980
The Bulls, of course.

144
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:19,519
What?

145
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,160
That wasn't a foul!

146
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,800
Oh, come on, ref!

147
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,079
Don't worry, Shaq always screws up free throws.

148
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,680
Yeah, you were right.

149
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,319
He didn't make the shot.

150
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,800
Yeah, that was a great shot.

151
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,519
Three pointer, yeah!

152
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,160
Oh, did you see that?

153
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,699
He traveled and the ref didn't even call it.

154
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,759
This ref needs glasses.

155
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,180
Hey, ref!

156
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,899
Open your eyes!

157
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,420
I can't believe you didn't see that.

158
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,040
Okay.

159
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,279
The end of the first quarter.

160
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,399
Hey, I'm going to make a beer run.

161
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:52,720
Sweet.

162
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,279
Alright sports fans, so now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

163
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,540
Fluency Builder.

164
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,720
Okay, today on Fluency Builder we have two really common words that you would listen to while you're watching a game.

165
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,939
Yeah, these are sort of slangy words, hey?

166
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,379
Yeah, they're kind of common.

167
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,439
Like informal.

168
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:15,079
Informal.

169
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,899
The first one that we have is screw up.

170
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,019
Screw up.

171
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,519
Screw up.

172
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,379
Screw up.

173
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:22,379
To screw up.

174
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:25,800
Yeah, so this is a good way of saying...

175
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,939
To make a mistake.

176
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:30,860
Let's listen to some examples of how this word is used.

177
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Example one.

178
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,959
Jill, you really screwed up this time.

179
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,860
You're fired.

180
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,860
Example two.

181
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,339
This game is important.

182
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,439
If you screw it up, we're out of the finals.

183
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,379
Example three.

184
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,939
Example four.

185
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,720
Okay, so screw up is mess up.

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,620
Yeah, make a mistake.

187
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,240
Make a mistake.

188
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,040
Great, and our last word on Fluency Builder today, a beer run.

189
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,139
A beer run.

190
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,240
Beer run.

191
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,519
So what is this beer run?

192
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:20,959
You run to get beer.

193
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,259
You go to the store and get beer, get more beer.

194
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:27,579
So it's just an expression meaning to go and get more beer.

195
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,339
Yeah, usually you're watching a game or you're at home with your friends.

196
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,259
You run out of beer, so somebody has to...

197
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:35,540
Go get some beer.

198
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,160
Go get some beer.

199
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,980
Make a beer run.

200
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,060
Hey, has the game started yet?

201
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,740
Yeah, about five minutes ago.

202
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:47,399
Who's winning?

203
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,560
The Bulls, of course.

204
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,800
What?

205
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,100
That wasn't a foul.

206
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,439
Oh, come on, ref.

207
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,540
Don't worry, Shaq always screws up free throws.

208
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,439
You were right, he didn't make the shot.

209
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,120
Yeah, that was a great shot.

210
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:07,860
Three pointer, yeah.

211
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,060
Did you see that?

212
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,220
He traveled and the ref didn't even call it.

213
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:12,680
This ref needs glasses.

214
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,439
Hey ref, open your eyes.

215
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:17,180
Can't believe he didn't see that.

216
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,699
Okay, end of the first quarter.

217
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,480
Alright, I'm going to make a beer run.

218
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,779
