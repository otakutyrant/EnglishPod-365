00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we have another great elementary lesson for you all.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've got a lesson for all you sports fans out there.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Right.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're doing a podcast on sports today.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're starting off with basketball.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we've got lots of language about basketball and sports in this lesson today.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Great.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Vocabulary Preview Two words for you today.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The first one is foul.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Foul.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Foul.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
A foul.

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Basically it's an action in a game that is not allowed.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Right.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So if you're playing basketball and you kick the other player.

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's a foul.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's a foul.

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's a pretty big foul.

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah.

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you're playing soccer and you pick up the ball.

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's also a foul.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Uh-huh.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Our second word is ref.

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Ref.

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
R-E-F.

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Also known as a referee.

34
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Uh-huh.

35
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Right.

36
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So a referee is...

37
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Basically like the judge of a game.

38
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The judge of the game.

39
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

40
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So he's the one that will...

41
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Say, that was a foul.

42
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That was a foul.

43
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Exactly.

44
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Ref.

45
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Also known as referee.

46
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay.

47
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So two great words.

48
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We're going to hear them in our dialogue.

49
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And we're going to be listening to two guys who are watching a basketball game on TV.

50
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hey, has the game started yet?

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah.

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
About five minutes ago.

53
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Who's winning?

54
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Bulls, of course.

55
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What?

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That wasn't a foul.

57
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, come on, ref.

58
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't worry.

59
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Shaq always screws up free throws.

60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You were right.

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He didn't make the shot.

62
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah.

63
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That was a great shot.

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Three pointer.

65
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah.

66
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Did you see that?

67
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He traveled to the ref.

68
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Didn't even call it.

69
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This ref needs glasses.

70
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey, ref.

71
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Open your eyes.

72
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Can't believe he didn't see that.

73
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay.

74
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
End of the first quarter.

75
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
All right.

76
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm going to make a beer run.

77
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right.

78
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
A really common situation whenever you're watching games with friends, right?

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You need to get a beer.

80
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We'll talk about that in a little while.

81
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's take a look at language takeaway.

82
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Language takeaway.

83
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

84
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's take a look at our first word on language takeaway.

85
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Free throw.

86
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Free throw.

87
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Free throw.

88
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This one's a bit hard to say, isn't it?

89
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's a little bit hard to explain, but if you're playing basketball and if someone fouls you, you get a free throw.

90
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So that's when all the players line up around you and you can throw the ball.

91
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
To the basket without anyone blocking you or anything.

92
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Right.

93
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
A little bit complicated, but I'm sure the basketball fans understand what a free throw is.

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
All right.

95
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Our next word is?

96
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Make the shot.

97
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Make the shot.

98
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Make the shot.

99
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's listen to some examples and we'll understand the meaning of make the shot.

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Example one.

101
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't believe it.

102
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He made the shot from the other side of the court.

103
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Example two.

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There's no way he's going to make that shot.

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He's way too far away from the net.

106
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Example three.

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If Gretzky makes this shot, they're going to win the Stanley Cup.

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So it's clear now to make the shot is to successfully put the ball in the basket.

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can use this expression in other sports as well, right?

110
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, you can use it in hockey to make the shot.

111
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You could also use it in golf.

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
In a lot of different sports they use the term to shoot.

113
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Shoot the ball.

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So anytime you shoot the ball, you can make the shot.

116
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Exactly.

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay, our next word today, three pointer.

118
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Three pointer.

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Three pointer.

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A three pointer.

121
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's a shot in basketball when you get three points.

122
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Usually this shot is taken from further out.

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, farther distance.

125
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, so it's a little bit more difficult to make this shot.

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You know, sometimes people might say a three point shot or something like that, but our EnglishPod learners, they know.

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's a three pointer.

128
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, you'll sound really knowledgeable, really cool using that one.

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Three pointer.

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And our last word today, travel.

131
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Travel.

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
To travel.

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Travel.

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
When you walk with the basketball.

135
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Well, technically you're allowed to take two steps in basketball.

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So when you take more than two steps, then it's traveling.

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So, yeah, traveling means to take more than two steps with the ball.

138
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's listen to the dialogue a second time.

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This time it'll be a bit slower so that we can understand some of these great phrases we just talked about.

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hey, has the game started yet?

141
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, about five minutes ago.

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, who's winning?

143
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The Bulls, of course.

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What?

145
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That wasn't a foul!

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, come on, ref!

147
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't worry, Shaq always screws up free throws.

148
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, you were right.

149
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He didn't make the shot.

150
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, that was a great shot.

151
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Three pointer, yeah!

152
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, did you see that?

153
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He traveled and the ref didn't even call it.

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This ref needs glasses.

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hey, ref!

156
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Open your eyes!

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't believe you didn't see that.

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

159
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The end of the first quarter.

160
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hey, I'm going to make a beer run.

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Sweet.

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Alright sports fans, so now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Fluency Builder.

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay, today on Fluency Builder we have two really common words that you would listen to while you're watching a game.

165
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, these are sort of slangy words, hey?

166
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, they're kind of common.

167
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Like informal.

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Informal.

169
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The first one that we have is screw up.

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Screw up.

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Screw up.

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Screw up.

173
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
To screw up.

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, so this is a good way of saying...

175
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
To make a mistake.

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's listen to some examples of how this word is used.

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Example one.

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Jill, you really screwed up this time.

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You're fired.

180
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Example two.

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This game is important.

182
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If you screw it up, we're out of the finals.

183
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Example three.

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Example four.

185
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay, so screw up is mess up.

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, make a mistake.

187
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Make a mistake.

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Great, and our last word on Fluency Builder today, a beer run.

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
A beer run.

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Beer run.

191
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So what is this beer run?

192
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You run to get beer.

193
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You go to the store and get beer, get more beer.

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So it's just an expression meaning to go and get more beer.

195
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, usually you're watching a game or you're at home with your friends.

196
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You run out of beer, so somebody has to...

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Go get some beer.

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Go get some beer.

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Make a beer run.

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hey, has the game started yet?

201
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, about five minutes ago.

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who's winning?

203
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The Bulls, of course.

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What?

205
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That wasn't a foul.

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, come on, ref.

207
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Don't worry, Shaq always screws up free throws.

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You were right, he didn't make the shot.

209
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, that was a great shot.

210
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Three pointer, yeah.

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Did you see that?

212
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He traveled and the ref didn't even call it.

213
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This ref needs glasses.

214
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Hey ref, open your eyes.

215
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Can't believe he didn't see that.

216
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, end of the first quarter.

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Alright, I'm going to make a beer run.

218
