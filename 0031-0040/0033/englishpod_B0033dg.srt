1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,580
Hey, has the game started yet?

2
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,240
Yeah, about five minutes ago.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,900
Who's winning?

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,099
The Bulls, of course.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,300
What?

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,600
That wasn't a foul!

7
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:17,940
Oh, come on, ref!

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:18,559
Don't worry.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,960
Shaq always screws up free throws.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
You were right.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,920
He didn't make the shot.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,620
Yeah, that was a great shot.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,359
Three pointer, yeah.

14
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:33,479
Did you see that?

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:34,859
He traveled to the ref.

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,700
Didn't even call it.

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,159
This ref needs glasses.

18
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,939
Hey, ref, open your eyes!

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,700
Can't believe he didn't see that.

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,219
Okay, end of the first quarter.

21
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:45,960
All right, I'm going to make a beer run.

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,659
He's got it again!

23
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,279
Thoroughbred basketball.
