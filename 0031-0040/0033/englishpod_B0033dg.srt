1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey, has the game started yet?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, about five minutes ago.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Who's winning?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The Bulls, of course.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That wasn't a foul!

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, come on, ref!

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Don't worry.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Shaq always screws up free throws.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You were right.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He didn't make the shot.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah, that was a great shot.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Three pointer, yeah.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Did you see that?

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He traveled to the ref.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Didn't even call it.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This ref needs glasses.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hey, ref, open your eyes!

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Can't believe he didn't see that.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, end of the first quarter.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All right, I'm going to make a beer run.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
He's got it again!

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Thoroughbred basketball.
