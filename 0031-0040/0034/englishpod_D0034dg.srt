This is Madeline Wright for BCC News reporting live from Washington D.C.

00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,480
where very shortly the new President will deliver his inaugural address.

3
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:26,280
Just moments ago the President was sworn into office following the United States Constitution.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,500
The President sought an oath to faithfully execute the office of the presidency.

5
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,920
And what exactly is going on now, Madeline?

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,619
Well Tom, true to American tradition, the band has just played Hail to the Chief and the President has been honored with a 21-gun salute.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,399
Now we're waiting for the President to take the stage and deliver his speech.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,820
Tom is like the who's who of the political world here on Capitol Hill, with dignitaries representing several different countries.

9
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,259
What's the mood on the ground like, Madeline?

10
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,439
In a word, the mood here is electric.

11
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,840
The excitement in the air is palpable.

12
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,619
I've never seen a larger crowd here on Capitol Hill.

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,960
The audience is shouting, crying and embracing each other.

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,359
On this, a most historic day, you can feel the hope and the excitement in the air.

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,000
The 20th of January will go down in history as the...

16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,239
Oh Tom, it looks like the President is about to begin.

17
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:25,239
My fellow Americans, I stand before you today...
