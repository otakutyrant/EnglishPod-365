This is Madeline Wright for BCC News reporting live from Washington D.C.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
where very shortly the new President will deliver his inaugural address.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Just moments ago the President was sworn into office following the United States Constitution.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The President sought an oath to faithfully execute the office of the presidency.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And what exactly is going on now, Madeline?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well Tom, true to American tradition, the band has just played Hail to the Chief and the President has been honored with a 21-gun salute.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now we're waiting for the President to take the stage and deliver his speech.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Tom is like the who's who of the political world here on Capitol Hill, with dignitaries representing several different countries.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's the mood on the ground like, Madeline?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In a word, the mood here is electric.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The excitement in the air is palpable.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I've never seen a larger crowd here on Capitol Hill.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The audience is shouting, crying and embracing each other.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
On this, a most historic day, you can feel the hope and the excitement in the air.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The 20th of January will go down in history as the...

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh Tom, it looks like the President is about to begin.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My fellow Americans, I stand before you today...
