00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello English learners, welcome back to another great lesson here with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,219
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,259
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,240
And today we're bringing you an upper intermediate lesson.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,800
A special lesson about the new president.

6
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:19,120
Right, it's been a hot topic in the US, the new president-elect, President Obama.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,679
Yes.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,399
So today we're bringing you something that you might see at his inaugural address.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,420
That's true.

10
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:29,260
So Marco, can you explain this word, inaugural address?

11
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:36,320
The inaugural address is the first speech the president gives at the ceremony when he is officially president.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:36,939
Okay.

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:37,740
All right.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
So it's his first presidential speech.

15
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:40,659
Exactly.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:41,799
Great.

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,579
So let's take a look at some other words that we're going to find in the dialogue today in Vocabulary Preview.

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,560
Vocabulary Preview.

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,119
All right, on Vocabulary Preview today we have two words.

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,920
The first one is swear in.

21
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,200
Swear in.

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,719
Swear in.

23
00:00:59,119 --> 00:00:59,880
Swear in.

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,420
We'll see this word in its past tense in the dialogue, right?

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,519
Sworn in.

26
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,459
Sworn in.

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,439
So it means...

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,980
So to swear someone in is to officially give that person a very important position, usually in government.

29
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:14,599
Yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,079
And our second word is oath.

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:18,840
Oath.

32
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,640
O-A-T-H, oath.

33
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,819
An oath goes hand in hand with swear in, right?

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,379
That's right.

35
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,280
When you swear someone in, they make an oath.

36
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,560
A promise, right?

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,540
A promise.

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,159
An official promise to carry out the duties of that job.

39
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:33,879
Right.

40
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,599
So they promise that they will do their job.

41
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:36,359
Okay, great.

42
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:40,079
So now let's listen to our dialogue for a first time.

43
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:40,840
Where are we?

44
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:44,060
Well, we're actually watching a news reporter on TV.

45
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,340
She's in Washington and she's going to tell us all about what's happening.

46
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:48,340
So let's listen.

47
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,599
This is Madeline Wright for BCC News reporting live from Washington, D.C.

48
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,479
where, very shortly, the new president will deliver his inaugural address.

49
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,240
Just moments ago, the president was sworn into office following the United States Constitution.

50
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,439
The president sought an oath to faithfully execute the office of the presidency.

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,919
And what exactly is going on now, Madeline?

52
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:27,580
Well, Tom, true to American tradition, the band has just played Hail to the Chief and the president has been honored with a 21-gun salute.

53
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,379
Now we're waiting for the president to take the stage and deliver his speech.

54
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:37,800
Tom is like the who's who of the political world here on Capitol Hill with dignitaries representing several different countries.

55
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,219
What's the mood on the ground like, Madeline?

56
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,400
In a word, the mood here is electric.

57
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,819
The excitement in the air is palpable.

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,560
I've never seen a larger crowd here on Capitol Hill.

59
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,900
The audience is shouting, crying and embracing each other.

60
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,319
On this, a most historic day, you can feel the hope and the excitement in the air.

61
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,580
The 20th of January will go down in history as the...

62
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,219
Oh, Tom, it looks like the president is about to begin.

63
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,060
My fellow Americans, I stand before you today.

64
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,900
OK, some technical problems at the inaugural address.

65
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,819
Yeah, I certainly hope this doesn't happen.

66
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,340
Well, if it does, you heard it first at EnglishPod.

67
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,979
Predictors of the future here.

68
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,120
OK, let's take a look at language takeaway.

69
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,000
Language takeaway.

70
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,639
On language takeaway today, we're bringing you four words.

71
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,039
The first word is deliver.

72
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,020
Deliver.

73
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:41,659
Deliver.

74
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,719
Like, deliver a pizza.

75
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,080
No, let's listen.

76
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:49,439
We've got three examples that will show the meaning of this word.

77
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:50,939
Example one.

78
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,719
Who's going to deliver the welcome speech?

79
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,020
Example two.

80
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,819
I've been asked to deliver a presentation on the findings of our research project.

81
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,460
Example three.

82
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,400
Dr.

83
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,879
Rosen is delivering a lecture on macroeconomics.

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,339
OK, so deliver a speech.

85
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,399
Say a speech.

86
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,639
To say a speech.

87
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

88
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:26,420
So you wouldn't say say a speech, you would say deliver a speech.

89
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:26,839
Exactly.

90
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,680
OK.

91
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,120
OK, our second word for language takeaway.

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,300
The who's who.

93
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,620
The who's who.

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,399
The who's who.

95
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,259
So this is a funny expression, hey?

96
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,660
It's kind of weird.

97
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,160
The who's who is the important people in a particular field, right?

98
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:42,819
Right.

99
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:49,259
So for example, there was a party last night and the who's who of the film industry was there.

100
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:49,959
Whoa.

101
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,439
So all the important stars and directors.

102
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,540
OK.

103
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:00,000
You could also say the funeral was like a who's who of the political world.

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,660
OK.

105
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,579
So all the important political figures were at this funeral.

106
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,100
Exactly.

107
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,199
Let's move to our third word.

108
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,660
Dignitaries.

109
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:08,959
Dignitaries.

110
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:10,339
Dignitaries.

111
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,319
Dignitaries.

112
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,560
OK, we have some great examples so you can understand what this word means, so let's listen.

113
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:18,160
Example one.

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,339
Several important dignitaries were present at the opening ceremony, including the president of Brazil, the king of Spain, and the pope.

115
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,680
Example two.

116
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,339
There are going to be a lot of foreign dignitaries at the dinner.

117
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,620
So basically we can understand that dignitaries are really important people, right?

118
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:44,040
Right.

119
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,620
Important political or religious figures.

120
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,519
I see.

121
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,600
All right.

122
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,779
Now our last word for language takeaway.

123
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,019
Palpable.

124
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,319
Palpable.

125
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,480
Palpable.

126
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,180
Palpable.

127
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,319
When something is palpable, it's so strong you can feel it.

128
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,540
OK, so it's a very strong feeling.

129
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,980
You can almost touch it.

130
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,240
Yeah, like the excitement was palpable or the fear was palpable.

131
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:08,040
OK.

132
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,100
Interesting word.

133
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,759
Palpable.

134
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,939
Let's listen to our dialogue again and now let's try and listen to all these words we just talked about.

135
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:37,959
This is Madeline Wright for BCC News reporting live from Washington, DC, where very shortly the new president will deliver his inaugural address.

136
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,660
Just moments ago, the president was sworn into office following the United States Constitution.

137
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,879
The president sought an oath to faithfully execute the office of the presidency.

138
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,339
And what exactly is going on now, Madeline?

139
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:57,040
Well, Tom, true to American tradition, the band has just played Hail to the Chief and the president has been honored with a 21-gun salute.

140
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,839
Now we're waiting for the president to take the stage and deliver his speech.

141
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,240
Tom, it's like the who's who of the political world here on Capitol Hill, with dignitaries representing several different countries.

142
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,660
What's the mood on the ground like, Madeline?

143
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,839
In a word, the mood here is electric.

144
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,240
The excitement in the air is palpable.

145
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,019
I've never seen a larger crowd here on Capitol Hill.

146
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,339
The audience is shouting, crying and embracing each other.

147
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,660
On this, a most historic day, you can feel the hope and the excitement in the air.

148
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,899
The 20th of January will go down in history as the...

149
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,660
Oh, Tom, it looks like the president is about to begin.

150
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:41,519
My fellow Americans, I stand before you today.

151
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,600
Okay, so if you noticed in our dialogue, we have some really interesting phrases there.

152
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:49,980
Yes.

153
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,180
So, I think it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

154
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:55,600
Fluency Builder.

155
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:04,519
On Fluency Builder today, we're going to be looking at three phrases that are very interesting because we can change them a little bit and form different patterns.

156
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:08,779
Yeah, so the first phrase we have is in a word.

157
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,560
In a word.

158
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,459
In a word.

159
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:12,220
In a word.

160
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,660
We use this expression when we want to describe something in one word.

161
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,279
Right.

162
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,079
Pretty simple, hey?

163
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,000
It's really simple.

164
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,060
Let's look at the pattern.

165
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,240
We've got examples of how you could use this phrase.

166
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,480
Example one.

167
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,459
In a word, the situation is serious.

168
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,700
Example two.

169
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,940
What's it like there?

170
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,340
In a word, it's amazing.

171
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,559
Okay, so in a word, this podcast is...

172
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,100
Awesome.

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,080
Amazing.

174
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,679
Uh-huh.

175
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,399
Okay.

176
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,320
Okay, let's look at our second phrase today.

177
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,240
Go down in history.

178
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,960
Go down in history.

179
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,259
Go down in history.

180
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,419
So this is a really common phrase.

181
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,080
I'm sure you guys have heard it.

182
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:07,580
Yeah, basically something that is really important that everyone will remember for a very long time.

183
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,820
Let's look at this pattern with a few examples.

184
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,480
Example one.

185
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,539
This is going to go down in history as the worst disaster the world has ever seen.

186
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:25,679
Example two.

187
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,259
He'll go down in history as the best president we've ever had.

188
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,159
Example three.

189
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,639
This day will go down in history.

190
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,039
Example three.

191
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,259
Okay, so as you can see, the pattern is we're using a superlative.

192
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,159
That's right, the most, the best.

193
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,779
The biggest.

194
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:55,799
The worst.

195
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:56,860
The worst, right?

196
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,139
And our final phrase in putting it together is...

197
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,240
My fellow Americans.

198
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,960
My fellow Americans.

199
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,700
My fellow Americans.

200
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:08,519
So obviously you can change this one up a little bit, hey?

201
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,600
Right, you can say my fellow co-workers.

202
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,139
Uh-huh.

203
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,820
My fellow citizens.

204
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,480
My fellow family members.

205
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:17,259
Yes.

206
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,779
So basically fellow just means like deer.

207
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,539
In some way.

208
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:24,779
Well, similar.

209
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:25,240
Similar.

210
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:25,580
Yeah.

211
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:33,259
So we looked at some great vocabulary and phrases, and now let's talk a little bit about these American traditions when electing a new president.

212
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:33,759
Yes.

213
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,799
Today in the studio we have JP who's joining us.

214
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,460
Hi everyone.

215
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,159
Hey JP.

216
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,240
And he's going to be talking to us about these traditions.

217
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,539
Oh, I am.

218
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:42,899
Okay.

219
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:43,360
Yeah.

220
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,500
What are we going to talk about?

221
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,600
Twenty-one gun salute.

222
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,500
What's that all about?

223
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,159
The twenty-one gun salute is the military salute where they say, and now we will have the twenty-one gun salute.

224
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,360
So twenty-one soldiers with their rifles, they go, and they all shoot them off at the same time.

225
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,700
And I don't know why.

226
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,200
I think it's a sign of respect, hey?

227
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:03,919
Yeah.

228
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,360
We would respect those shooting guns.

229
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,620
Well, I think in Europe they would do a cannon or something.

230
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,720
A cannon salute?

231
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,019
No, well, just cannons.

232
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,679
Maybe just one cannon.

233
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,039
Maybe our European listeners know the answer to this.

234
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,080
Okay.

235
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,000
And what about this song Hail to the Chief?

236
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:20,940
Do you know anything about that?

237
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,080
I do not know anything about it, except that it's a march, and I think it's Sousa.

238
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,620
I think John Philip Sousa wrote it.

239
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,059
And whenever the president walks into a room, they play that song.

240
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,500
Really?

241
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,500
Yes, and I played it once for President Bush, the first one.

242
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:34,139
I was a drummer.

243
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:35,059
You did?

244
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,759
And my marching band had to play that song for him.

245
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,240
Oh my God, JP, you're like famous.

246
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:40,059
Yeah.

247
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:43,019
This was back in like 1986 or something.

248
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:44,840
Was that even an election year, 88?

249
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,679
Well, you did play for the president, so you know.

250
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:49,139
That's pretty cool.

251
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:49,600
Yeah.

252
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,399
So, JP, do you have any other sort of traditional things that happen when the president becomes the president?

253
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:05,500
Well, I can tell you that Jimmy Carter, you know, when he was elected president, his motorcade was going down Pennsylvania Avenue, and he stopped the car and got out.

254
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,220
Really?

255
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:06,679
To do what?

256
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,179
Yeah, to walk.

257
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:09,759
He wanted to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.

258
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,500
He wanted to walk down the, you know, down the street.

259
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,960
To be with the people.

260
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:15,379
Yeah, I think so.

261
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,340
And I think it made the Secret Service insane.

262
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,360
Maybe the car smelled bad or something.

263
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:21,879
Maybe so.

264
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,240
I think that is my memory of it.

265
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,320
I might be confusing with the West Wing, but I'm not sure.

266
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,600
Too much TV.

267
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,500
Yeah, maybe.

268
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,340
When the president walks, it's a big deal.

269
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,779
So, JP, do you do anything special for the inauguration ceremony?

270
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,740
I always take the day off to watch.

271
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,419
You do?

272
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,340
I love watching it.

273
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:46,000
I love, you know, the swearing-in ceremony, the ritual of it, the speech.

274
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,740
All right, everyone, we're out of time.

275
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:49,980
I hope you enjoyed this political lesson.

276
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,039
And I hope you have a happy Inauguration Day.

277
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,539
Happy Inauguration Day, everyone.

278
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:53,820
Yeah.

279
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:54,360
Okay.

280
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,899
All right, great.

281
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,960
We're definitely going to take the day off to watch it with JP, and hopefully you guys can too.

282
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,179
Well, thanks for listening, everyone, and until next time, goodbye.
