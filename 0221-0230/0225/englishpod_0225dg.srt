00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
EnglishPod.com Alright, let's run through this one more time from the top.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I will be positioned here, across from the bank on this park bench.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, according to the intel we got from Jimmy...

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, who's Jimmy?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Jeez, Ralph, pay attention, will ya?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Jimmy's our mole, you know?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The guy on the inside?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He's been snooping and passing on the info to us so we can pull this heist off.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, Ralph, clean the mothballs out of your ears and listen up.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This here's important!

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We don't want to end up back in the slammer, do ya?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Your role is pretty important here, we're dependent on you, man.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, okay, I'm listening...

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mothballs.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Alrighty then, where was I?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh yeah, okay.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So I'll be on the lookout, sitting here on the bench across from the bank.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Nobody moves until I give the go-ahead, alright?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And what's the go-ahead, Ralph?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You, um...

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
you, uh...

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh yeah, you'll take off your hat and scratch your head.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Right.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
When I take my hat off and scratch my head, you do what?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I get in the box.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Right, you get in the box.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll make sure it's all sealed and then posing as the delivery guy, I'll drop off a special package for the manager.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now, according to Jimmy, the bank manager's leaving early on Tuesday because it's his wedding anniversary.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He and the wife are having a romantic rendezvous in the country, so any packages delivered will be left unopened in his office until he gets back late on Wednesday.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Which gives us access to his office for at least 12 hours.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay, Ralph, this is where you come in.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Where are you?

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm standing right next to you, Sammy.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, sorry, Sam.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm in the box, right here, in that box.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And what do you do once I deliver you to the manager's office?

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I stay in the box until the bank is closed.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And then I get out of the box.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And then?

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What next, Ralph?

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, for Pete's sake, this is never going to work.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hey, give me a chance here, fellas.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I crack the safe and then...

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
then I take the money.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And then I...

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
well, I get back in the box.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Atta boy, Ralph.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In the morning, I come back to the bank, say there's been a mix-up with the delivery I made, and take the special package back here.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All right, let's get some sleep.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a big day tomorrow, fellas.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
A perfect plan, Sammy.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It went off without a hitch.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's open this up and get Ralph out of here so we can start counting the money.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Phew, I sure am glad to see you guys.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I was sure getting lonely with no one to talk.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's nice.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay, how much?

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Uh, really?

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Really, really, really glad.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Money, Ralph.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Money!

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, man.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I knew I forgot something.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Dammit.
