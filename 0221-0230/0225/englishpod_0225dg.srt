00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:11,000
EnglishPod.com Alright, let's run through this one more time from the top.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,439
I will be positioned here, across from the bank on this park bench.

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,220
Now, according to the intel we got from Jimmy...

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,879
Oh, who's Jimmy?

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,760
Jeez, Ralph, pay attention, will ya?

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,679
Jimmy's our mole, you know?

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,420
The guy on the inside?

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,679
He's been snooping and passing on the info to us so we can pull this heist off.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,200
Yeah, Ralph, clean the mothballs out of your ears and listen up.

10
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,679
This here's important!

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,659
We don't want to end up back in the slammer, do ya?

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,020
Your role is pretty important here, we're dependent on you, man.

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,179
Okay, okay, I'm listening...

14
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:45,740
Mothballs.

15
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,719
Alrighty then, where was I?

16
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:49,840
Oh yeah, okay.

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,200
So I'll be on the lookout, sitting here on the bench across from the bank.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,520
Nobody moves until I give the go-ahead, alright?

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,659
And what's the go-ahead, Ralph?

20
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:02,280
You, um...

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,320
you, uh...

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,799
Oh yeah, you'll take off your hat and scratch your head.

23
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,620
Right.

24
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,680
When I take my hat off and scratch my head, you do what?

25
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,980
I get in the box.

26
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,099
Right, you get in the box.

27
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:20,599
I'll make sure it's all sealed and then posing as the delivery guy, I'll drop off a special package for the manager.

28
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:26,920
Now, according to Jimmy, the bank manager's leaving early on Tuesday because it's his wedding anniversary.

29
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:36,680
He and the wife are having a romantic rendezvous in the country, so any packages delivered will be left unopened in his office until he gets back late on Wednesday.

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,959
Which gives us access to his office for at least 12 hours.

31
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,760
Okay, Ralph, this is where you come in.

32
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,099
Where are you?

33
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,680
I'm standing right next to you, Sammy.

34
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,680
Oh, sorry, Sam.

35
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,920
I'm in the box, right here, in that box.

36
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,359
And what do you do once I deliver you to the manager's office?

37
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,400
I stay in the box until the bank is closed.

38
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,359
And then I get out of the box.

39
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,700
And then?

40
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,359
What next, Ralph?

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,219
Oh, for Pete's sake, this is never going to work.

42
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,259
Hey, give me a chance here, fellas.

43
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,400
I crack the safe and then...

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,520
then I take the money.

45
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,479
And then I...

46
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,960
well, I get back in the box.

47
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,580
Atta boy, Ralph.

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,939
In the morning, I come back to the bank, say there's been a mix-up with the delivery I made, and take the special package back here.

49
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,099
All right, let's get some sleep.

50
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,259
It's a big day tomorrow, fellas.

51
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,120
A perfect plan, Sammy.

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,800
It went off without a hitch.

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,479
Let's open this up and get Ralph out of here so we can start counting the money.

54
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,180
Phew, I sure am glad to see you guys.

55
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,560
I was sure getting lonely with no one to talk.

56
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,500
That's nice.

57
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:49,520
Okay, how much?

58
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:50,919
Uh, really?

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,639
Really, really, really glad.

60
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,900
Money, Ralph.

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,479
Money!

62
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,120
Oh, man.

63
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,139
I knew I forgot something.

64
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,180
Dammit.
