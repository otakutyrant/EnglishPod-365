EnglishPod.com Do you hear the starter motor crank?

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The engine won't start.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Should I maybe press the accelerator?

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you step on the accelerator pedal, you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So what do you think it is?

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Um, yeah.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Right.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I got the car started.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thanks for your help.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I told you to fill the tank!
