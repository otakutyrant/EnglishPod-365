EnglishPod.com Do you hear the starter motor crank?

2
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:33,159
Yeah.

3
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,659
It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.

4
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,060
The engine won't start.

5
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,320
Should I maybe press the accelerator?

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,380
No.

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,039
If you step on the accelerator pedal, you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start.

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,140
So what do you think it is?

9
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:54,960
I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?

10
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,600
Um, yeah.

11
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:58,780
Right.

12
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,520
I got the car started.

13
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:01,820
Thanks for your help.

14
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,200
I told you to fill the tank!
