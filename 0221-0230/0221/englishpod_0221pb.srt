00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking all about cars in this intermediate level lesson.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We have a little bit of problems with our car, and we're going to talk about some possible solutions to these car problems we have.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So why don't we just listen to the dialogue today?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We have no words on vocabulary preview, so let's jump right into the dialogue and listen for the first time.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Car Trouble Center, how may I help you?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
My car won't start.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Stupid old car.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hold on.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Before you kick your car, let's go through some possible problems.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Fine.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
First of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm here with my friend, and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The engine won't start.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Should I maybe press the accelerator?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
No.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If you step on the accelerator pedal, you can flood the carburetor, and your car will never start.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So what do you think it is?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Um, yeah, right.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I got the car started.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thanks for your help.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I told you to fill the tank.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, so this dialogue reminds me a lot of a radio show in America called Car Talk, and the hosts of the show, like Marco and I today, they talk about how to solve problems, and they ask you questions to find out what the problem is.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So it's a really helpful show, but let's take a look at some of the phrases and words that you heard so we can understand what exactly is going on here.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Language takeaway.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
All right, so today on Language Takeaway, we have five words, and they're all very specific to the car.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So why don't we start with the first word?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's a noun, and we are talking about the ignition.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Ignition.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The ignition is the first step to...

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The ignition is a part of the first step to starting a car.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Basically under the wheel of the car, the steering wheel, there is usually a silver hole where you can put the key in.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is the ignition.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It starts the car.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Exactly.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So you put the key in the ignition, and you can start the car.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
To start the car means to turn it on, to get it going.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's right.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And so ignition is the first step, starting the ignition.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, so moving on to our next word.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We have a word that's formed by two different parts.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
A spark plug.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A spark plug.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Spark plug.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So a spark plug is an electrical object.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Basically this has to do with electricity and the way that the car gets energy.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So it's called a spark plug because it creates a spark, which is a brief burst of current.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So this basically creates a small spark of electricity, and this makes the gasoline ignite.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So that's what makes the car go.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right, so energy is taken from the battery to start a small fire, basically, which then starts the engine.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Spark plug.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's a very small but very important part of a car.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Very good.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And moving on, we have the starter motor.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, to be very honest with you, I'm not a car person, so I'm not sure what the starter motor is.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Maybe you can explain this to us, Marco.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, so basically your car runs on gasoline, right?

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So you put your key into the ignition and you turn it, right?

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This in turn sends energy to this little motor called a starter motor, and that basically gets the car going by means of an electrical current before the gasoline ignites.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So it's like a little electrical motor that makes the spark plug ignite and causes some of the mechanical parts, like the pistons, move within the car and then it turns on.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, so again, this is all about the beginning of when we turn the key in the ignition, what happens.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is a starter motor.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So once we've turned the car on, we've turned the key in the ignition, we have to worry about giving the car gas.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So we can control gas with the accelerator pedal.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So by saying you want to give the car gas is you want to give it more energy, more power, or less energy, right?

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Right.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So if I want to go very fast, I push my foot down on the accelerator, and the further down it goes, the faster I move.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Exactly.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So that's the accelerator.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Now, the opposite of making the car go would make the car stop, and those are called...

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Brakes.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Brakes.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So on the left we have a brake pedal, and on the right we have an accelerator pedal.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Very good.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, and talking about acceleration and gas, we have a very specific mechanical object, and that's called a carburetor.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, again, carburetor, I know that this is under the hood of my car, but I'm not sure what it does.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's talk about this.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:31,000
All right, so it's not very common to have a carburetor anymore in new cars, but basically it's a small device that controls the flow of gasoline from the gas tank to the engine.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And basically what it does, it makes the gasoline into a type of very thin mist, and that's what...

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and that way the gasoline can ignite easier.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So the further down you push your foot on the accelerator, the wider the little gap or the hole will open on the carburetor, and that way your car will go faster.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
All right, very good.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So that's all we've got for Language Takeaway today, but don't go anywhere.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We'll be back in a second with Fluency Builder.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Car Trouble Center, how may I help you?

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
My car won't start.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Stupid old car.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hold on.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Before you kick your car, let's go through some possible problems.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Fine.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
First of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah.

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm here with my friend, and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank?

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The engine won't start.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Should I maybe press the accelerator?

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you step on the accelerator pedal, you can flood the carburetor, and your car will never start.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So what do you think it is?

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Um...

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
yeah.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Right.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I got the car started.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Thanks for your help.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I told you to fill the tank.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
All right, we're back.

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So now why don't we take a look at four key phrases that we have for you on Fluency Builder.

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Fluency Builder.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay, this first phrase.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So you heard the phrase at the beginning, car trouble center.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But car trouble center, that's maybe the name of a fake company that we use.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But the phrase car trouble is very, very common.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So if you say, I'm having car trouble, or I had some car trouble, what does that mean?

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That means my car broke.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But you don't say my car broke.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is one thing that can't break, because normally you say, I'm having trouble, or I'm having car trouble, because a part of my car is not working.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So instead of saying, I'm having problems with my car, or my car broke, you just say, I had car trouble, or I'm having car trouble.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's right.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So this is a really good excuse for coming to work late.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can say, oh, I'm so sorry.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I was having car trouble this morning.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So any type of problems with your car can be considered car trouble.

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Flat tire, no battery, et cetera, et cetera.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Now moving on, we have a very interesting verb here.

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We heard when the guy was talking about the starter motor, he said, do you hear the starter motor crank?

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, to crank.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So this is a very interesting verb.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It can also be a noun.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's a sound.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But it's also a movement.

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So when something turns around in a circle, thunk, thunk, thunk, maybe you think of a metal wheel, thunk, thunk, that's a crank.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So sometimes we talk about those old cars, you know, 1910s, 1920s, the first Ford cars, you had to crank them in the front.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You had to actually turn with your hand a wheel to make the car start.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So this is a crank.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So you can hear this in your car.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Maybe if your car doesn't have gasoline, you hear the thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, that's the starter motor cranking.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So it's going around in circles, trying, trying to create energy.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Exactly.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And now when the guy was talking about the accelerator and he was talking about the carburetor, he said, no, don't step on that pedal because you can flood the carburetor.

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So to flood.

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
To flood.

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This is a verb.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Maybe you've heard the word flood before as a noun, but this means to fill something with liquid, with gasoline, with water, with milk.

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So to flood something is to fill it up with the liquid.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay, very good.

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So you can flood a dam, for example, right?

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's right.

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Or in this case, you can flood a carburetor, which means it won't work because it's all wet.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay, very good.

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And the last phrase that we have very handy when you're talking about cars is to fill the tank.

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay, this is always a problem at my house because I hate to fill the tank.

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Really?

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So yeah, whenever my car's in the driveway and someone in my family asks if they can borrow it, I say, yeah, sure.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And then obviously an hour later they come back and say, why don't you ever fill the tank?

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's empty.

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You have no gas.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And I say, well, I hate to fill the car with gas.

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And so I always have an empty tank, so I never fill the tank.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay, so that's what it means to fill the tank is to have it full of gasoline.

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Right, to put gasoline into your gasoline tank.

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay, very good.

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Car trouble center, how may I help you?

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
My car won't start.

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Stupid old car.

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hold on.

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Before you kick your car, let's go through some possible problems.

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Fine.

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Okay.

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
First of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?

186
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah, I'm here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Those are possible problems, but tell me when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank?

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.

189
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The engine won't start.

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Should I maybe press the accelerator?

191
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
No.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If you step on the accelerator pedal, you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start.

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So what do you think it is?

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Um, yeah, right.

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I got the car started.

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Thanks for your help.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I told you to fill the tank.

199
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
All right, we're back.

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So talking about cars and car trouble.

201
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I understand, for example, in some countries, when you're getting a driver's license, you're forced or obliged to learn a little bit of car mechanics.

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You have to learn about the engine or how to change your tire and basic things like this.

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's a brilliant idea.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In America, you don't have to know how to fix your car.

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You have to know how to pay someone to fix your car.

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But basically, we only learn the rules of the road, so the signs and the basic rules.

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Really?

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, but I think it would be very helpful to know how to fix a tire or how to change the oil in your car.

209
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I mean, is this a requirement in Ecuador?

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:33,000
When you're getting your driver's permit, your driver's license, you have to take a course which shows you the mechanics of the car, a first aid course, and also basic road rules and all that stuff.

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But basically, because it can be something very simple, like for example, they show you where the battery is, where you can check the oil, and basic things like this.

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So maybe the little cable from the battery just came loose, and that's why your car won't start.

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So instead of you waiting for two hours until somebody comes and picks you up or a tow truck, you can just check very briefly basic things that can maybe go wrong in your car, and you can just go on your way.

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's awesome.

216
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I had my dad for that.

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
My dad said, I'm not going to have a little girl who doesn't know how to change a tire or who doesn't know how to check the oil level.

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So yeah, but not everybody has a parent who will teach them.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Not only that, it's very handy because, for example, you get a flat tire, and sometimes, you know, cars can be a little bit tricky.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The wheel nuts are sometimes covered by a plastic cover, so you don't know how to take it off.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There's a special tool for that.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Or the jack.

223
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Sometimes the jack is not the normal one that you have to pump up and down.

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a little one that you have to turn a lever, and you have to do this.

225
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So it's very, very useful to know these things.

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Absolutely.

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm curious to know if our listeners out there have experience with cars and car mechanics, and if you have this rule, like Marco says they have in Ecuador, about learning about cars before you actually get your driver's license.

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

229
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We hope to see you there.

230
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
All right, guys.

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Bye.
