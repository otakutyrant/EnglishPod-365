00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,160
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking all about cars in this intermediate level lesson.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:12,900
That's right.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:21,039
We have a little bit of problems with our car, and we're going to talk about some possible solutions to these car problems we have.

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,739
So why don't we just listen to the dialogue today?

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,640
We have no words on vocabulary preview, so let's jump right into the dialogue and listen for the first time.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,119
Car Trouble Center, how may I help you?

9
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,700
My car won't start.

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,240
Stupid old car.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,700
Hold on.

12
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,880
Before you kick your car, let's go through some possible problems.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:46,679
Fine.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,560
Okay.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,039
First of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,079
Yeah.

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,979
I'm here with my friend, and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.

18
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:01,700
Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank?

19
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:02,960
Yeah.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,519
It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.

21
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,859
The engine won't start.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,140
Should I maybe press the accelerator?

23
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,200
No.

24
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,859
If you step on the accelerator pedal, you can flood the carburetor, and your car will never start.

25
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,959
So what do you think it is?

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,819
I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?

27
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:28,620
Um, yeah, right.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,340
I got the car started.

29
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:31,659
Thanks for your help.

30
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,079
I told you to fill the tank.

31
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:55,340
Okay, so this dialogue reminds me a lot of a radio show in America called Car Talk, and the hosts of the show, like Marco and I today, they talk about how to solve problems, and they ask you questions to find out what the problem is.

32
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:02,900
So it's a really helpful show, but let's take a look at some of the phrases and words that you heard so we can understand what exactly is going on here.

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,400
Language takeaway.

34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,419
All right, so today on Language Takeaway, we have five words, and they're all very specific to the car.

35
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,199
So why don't we start with the first word?

36
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,939
It's a noun, and we are talking about the ignition.

37
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,180
Ignition.

38
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,599
The ignition is the first step to...

39
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,400
The ignition is a part of the first step to starting a car.

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:34,680
Basically under the wheel of the car, the steering wheel, there is usually a silver hole where you can put the key in.

41
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,060
This is the ignition.

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,379
It starts the car.

43
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,219
Exactly.

44
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,879
So you put the key in the ignition, and you can start the car.

45
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,759
To start the car means to turn it on, to get it going.

46
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,460
That's right.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,120
And so ignition is the first step, starting the ignition.

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
Okay, so moving on to our next word.

49
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,840
We have a word that's formed by two different parts.

50
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,199
A spark plug.

51
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:57,400
A spark plug.

52
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:58,340
Spark plug.

53
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,360
So a spark plug is an electrical object.

54
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,159
Basically this has to do with electricity and the way that the car gets energy.

55
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:15,240
So it's called a spark plug because it creates a spark, which is a brief burst of current.

56
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:21,900
So this basically creates a small spark of electricity, and this makes the gasoline ignite.

57
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,280
So that's what makes the car go.

58
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:31,000
Right, so energy is taken from the battery to start a small fire, basically, which then starts the engine.

59
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,080
Spark plug.

60
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,539
It's a very small but very important part of a car.

61
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,319
Very good.

62
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,979
And moving on, we have the starter motor.

63
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:44,020
Okay, to be very honest with you, I'm not a car person, so I'm not sure what the starter motor is.

64
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,560
Maybe you can explain this to us, Marco.

65
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:49,159
Okay, so basically your car runs on gasoline, right?

66
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,659
So you put your key into the ignition and you turn it, right?

67
00:03:53,199 --> 00:04:05,360
This in turn sends energy to this little motor called a starter motor, and that basically gets the car going by means of an electrical current before the gasoline ignites.

68
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:16,379
So it's like a little electrical motor that makes the spark plug ignite and causes some of the mechanical parts, like the pistons, move within the car and then it turns on.

69
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,060
Okay, so again, this is all about the beginning of when we turn the key in the ignition, what happens.

70
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,759
This is a starter motor.

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,079
So once we've turned the car on, we've turned the key in the ignition, we have to worry about giving the car gas.

72
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,399
So we can control gas with the accelerator pedal.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,180
So by saying you want to give the car gas is you want to give it more energy, more power, or less energy, right?

74
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:40,600
Right.

75
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:49,180
So if I want to go very fast, I push my foot down on the accelerator, and the further down it goes, the faster I move.

76
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:49,939
Exactly.

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,680
So that's the accelerator.

78
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,860
Now, the opposite of making the car go would make the car stop, and those are called...

79
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,000
Brakes.

80
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:57,500
Brakes.

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,959
So on the left we have a brake pedal, and on the right we have an accelerator pedal.

82
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,740
Very good.

83
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:10,920
Okay, and talking about acceleration and gas, we have a very specific mechanical object, and that's called a carburetor.

84
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:16,879
Okay, again, carburetor, I know that this is under the hood of my car, but I'm not sure what it does.

85
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,860
Let's talk about this.

86
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:31,720
All right, so it's not very common to have a carburetor anymore in new cars, but basically it's a small device that controls the flow of gasoline from the gas tank to the engine.

87
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:38,920
And basically what it does, it makes the gasoline into a type of very thin mist, and that's what...

88
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,839
and that way the gasoline can ignite easier.

89
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:53,120
So the further down you push your foot on the accelerator, the wider the little gap or the hole will open on the carburetor, and that way your car will go faster.

90
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,519
All right, very good.

91
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,040
So that's all we've got for Language Takeaway today, but don't go anywhere.

92
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,980
We'll be back in a second with Fluency Builder.

93
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:08,040
Car Trouble Center, how may I help you?

94
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,600
My car won't start.

95
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,180
Stupid old car.

96
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:12,620
Hold on.

97
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,819
Before you kick your car, let's go through some possible problems.

98
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:16,600
Fine.

99
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,480
Okay.

100
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,959
First of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?

101
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:20,959
Yeah.

102
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm here with my friend, and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.

103
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,639
Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank?

104
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,379
It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.

105
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,800
The engine won't start.

106
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,060
Should I maybe press the accelerator?

107
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,139
No.

108
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,800
If you step on the accelerator pedal, you can flood the carburetor, and your car will never start.

109
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,899
So what do you think it is?

110
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,720
I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?

111
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:56,819
Um...

112
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:57,319
yeah.

113
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,540
Right.

114
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,279
I got the car started.

115
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,579
Thanks for your help.

116
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,959
I told you to fill the tank.

117
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:08,879
All right, we're back.

118
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,160
So now why don't we take a look at four key phrases that we have for you on Fluency Builder.

119
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,620
Fluency Builder.

120
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,839
Okay, this first phrase.

121
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,259
So you heard the phrase at the beginning, car trouble center.

122
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,620
But car trouble center, that's maybe the name of a fake company that we use.

123
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,199
But the phrase car trouble is very, very common.

124
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,339
So if you say, I'm having car trouble, or I had some car trouble, what does that mean?

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,699
That means my car broke.

126
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,019
But you don't say my car broke.

127
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:48,399
This is one thing that can't break, because normally you say, I'm having trouble, or I'm having car trouble, because a part of my car is not working.

128
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:48,800
Okay.

129
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:56,160
So instead of saying, I'm having problems with my car, or my car broke, you just say, I had car trouble, or I'm having car trouble.

130
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,839
That's right.

131
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,480
So this is a really good excuse for coming to work late.

132
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,379
You can say, oh, I'm so sorry.

133
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,379
I was having car trouble this morning.

134
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,279
So any type of problems with your car can be considered car trouble.

135
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,779
Flat tire, no battery, et cetera, et cetera.

136
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:11,500
Okay.

137
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,500
Now moving on, we have a very interesting verb here.

138
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:20,899
We heard when the guy was talking about the starter motor, he said, do you hear the starter motor crank?

139
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:22,680
Okay, to crank.

140
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,560
So this is a very interesting verb.

141
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,500
It can also be a noun.

142
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,480
It's a sound.

143
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,199
Okay.

144
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,439
But it's also a movement.

145
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:38,320
So when something turns around in a circle, thunk, thunk, thunk, maybe you think of a metal wheel, thunk, thunk, that's a crank.

146
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:48,559
So sometimes we talk about those old cars, you know, 1910s, 1920s, the first Ford cars, you had to crank them in the front.

147
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,840
You had to actually turn with your hand a wheel to make the car start.

148
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,740
So this is a crank.

149
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:55,799
So you can hear this in your car.

150
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,299
Maybe if your car doesn't have gasoline, you hear the thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, that's the starter motor cranking.

151
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:06,340
So it's going around in circles, trying, trying to create energy.

152
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,019
Exactly.

153
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:15,899
And now when the guy was talking about the accelerator and he was talking about the carburetor, he said, no, don't step on that pedal because you can flood the carburetor.

154
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,320
So to flood.

155
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:18,320
Okay.

156
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,360
To flood.

157
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,259
This is a verb.

158
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:28,740
Maybe you've heard the word flood before as a noun, but this means to fill something with liquid, with gasoline, with water, with milk.

159
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,100
So to flood something is to fill it up with the liquid.

160
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,120
Okay, very good.

161
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,700
So you can flood a dam, for example, right?

162
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,200
That's right.

163
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,419
Or in this case, you can flood a carburetor, which means it won't work because it's all wet.

164
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:43,159
Okay, very good.

165
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:49,639
And the last phrase that we have very handy when you're talking about cars is to fill the tank.

166
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,080
Okay, this is always a problem at my house because I hate to fill the tank.

167
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,559
Really?

168
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,440
So yeah, whenever my car's in the driveway and someone in my family asks if they can borrow it, I say, yeah, sure.

169
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,720
And then obviously an hour later they come back and say, why don't you ever fill the tank?

170
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,600
It's empty.

171
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:07,779
You have no gas.

172
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,620
And I say, well, I hate to fill the car with gas.

173
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:13,960
And so I always have an empty tank, so I never fill the tank.

174
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,840
Okay, so that's what it means to fill the tank is to have it full of gasoline.

175
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,559
Right, to put gasoline into your gasoline tank.

176
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,019
Okay, very good.

177
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:27,539
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

178
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,440
Car trouble center, how may I help you?

179
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,039
My car won't start.

180
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:39,600
Stupid old car.

181
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,080
Hold on.

182
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,240
Before you kick your car, let's go through some possible problems.

183
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,039
Fine.

184
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:45,919
Okay.

185
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,419
First of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?

186
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:54,360
Yeah, I'm here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.

187
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,039
Those are possible problems, but tell me when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank?

188
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,879
Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.

189
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,279
The engine won't start.

190
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,519
Should I maybe press the accelerator?

191
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:10,559
No.

192
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,220
If you step on the accelerator pedal, you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start.

193
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:18,320
So what do you think it is?

194
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,159
I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?

195
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,980
Um, yeah, right.

196
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,700
I got the car started.

197
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:30,000
Thanks for your help.

198
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,440
I told you to fill the tank.

199
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,860
All right, we're back.

200
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,700
So talking about cars and car trouble.

201
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:52,039
I understand, for example, in some countries, when you're getting a driver's license, you're forced or obliged to learn a little bit of car mechanics.

202
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:56,279
You have to learn about the engine or how to change your tire and basic things like this.

203
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,580
That's a brilliant idea.

204
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,179
In America, you don't have to know how to fix your car.

205
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,360
You have to know how to pay someone to fix your car.

206
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:09,279
But basically, we only learn the rules of the road, so the signs and the basic rules.

207
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:09,700
Really?

208
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, but I think it would be very helpful to know how to fix a tire or how to change the oil in your car.

209
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,879
I mean, is this a requirement in Ecuador?

210
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,659
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

211
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:33,080
When you're getting your driver's permit, your driver's license, you have to take a course which shows you the mechanics of the car, a first aid course, and also basic road rules and all that stuff.

212
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:41,299
But basically, because it can be something very simple, like for example, they show you where the battery is, where you can check the oil, and basic things like this.

213
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,440
So maybe the little cable from the battery just came loose, and that's why your car won't start.

214
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:56,539
So instead of you waiting for two hours until somebody comes and picks you up or a tow truck, you can just check very briefly basic things that can maybe go wrong in your car, and you can just go on your way.

215
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,259
That's awesome.

216
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,580
I had my dad for that.

217
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,620
My dad said, I'm not going to have a little girl who doesn't know how to change a tire or who doesn't know how to check the oil level.

218
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,879
So yeah, but not everybody has a parent who will teach them.

219
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,840
Not only that, it's very handy because, for example, you get a flat tire, and sometimes, you know, cars can be a little bit tricky.

220
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,159
The wheel nuts are sometimes covered by a plastic cover, so you don't know how to take it off.

221
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,519
There's a special tool for that.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
Or the jack.

223
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,620
Sometimes the jack is not the normal one that you have to pump up and down.

224
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,360
It's a little one that you have to turn a lever, and you have to do this.

225
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,259
So it's very, very useful to know these things.

226
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:33,960
Absolutely.

227
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:47,379
I'm curious to know if our listeners out there have experience with cars and car mechanics, and if you have this rule, like Marco says they have in Ecuador, about learning about cars before you actually get your driver's license.

228
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,740
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

229
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,440
We hope to see you there.

230
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,019
All right, guys.

231
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:51,419
Bye.
