00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:05,339
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,139
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,039
My name is Katherine, and today we're going outside for our lesson.

4
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:10,960
That's right.

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,699
Today we are gardening.

6
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:15,400
We are going to set up our own garden.

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,120
Okay, that means growing plants and maybe even food.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,660
So let's take a listen to this dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about it.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,519
I've decided to grow my own garden.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,119
What?

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,679
You don't know the first thing about gardening.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,979
On the contrary, I've been reading a lot of books about the subject.

13
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,159
Oh yeah?

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,600
Tell me then, smarty pants, how will you go about setting up your garden?

15
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:48,100
Well, first I need to buy some things such as fertilizer, seeds, and tools.

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,500
What type of tools?

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,820
You know, the basics.

18
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,920
A rake, shovel, spade, and a hoe.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,560
Right.

20
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,280
Well, it seems like you have all your bases covered.

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,359
What's next?

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,780
I'll till the soil and then sow the seeds.

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,060
I'll then add some fertilizer, and voila.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,439
Gardening all done.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,180
Well, good luck with your garden, especially considering we're in the dry season and it won't rain for the next three months.

26
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:17,000
All right, we're back.

27
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,359
So a lot of vocab related to gardening.

28
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,260
We mentioned a lot of tools, and we're going to explain a lot of those now on Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,359
Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,560
Okay, so gardening has some very special tools, like you said, Marco.

31
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:37,060
The first one is one that I am not, well, it's actually not a tool.

32
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,799
It's a part of gardening, something that we use to help the plants grow, and I really don't like it because it smells bad.

33
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:43,500
Exactly.

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,939
It smells kind of bad, and it has a very strong smell.

35
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,260
And that is called fertilizer.

36
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,680
Fertilizer.

37
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:59,000
So basically, fertilizer is something that you use in a garden to help the plants grow better.

38
00:01:59,519 --> 00:01:59,680
Right.

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,680
I think it has a lot of vitamins and minerals that the plant needs to grow better, faster, stronger.

40
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,260
Fertilizer.

41
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:08,280
Okay, good.

42
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,580
And well, now we're going to mention four tools that we use in gardening, basic tools.

43
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,960
The first one being a rake.

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,340
A rake.

45
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,319
Rake.

46
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:18,800
Rake.

47
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:25,819
So a rake is actually something that's very common in most houses, especially houses with a yard or a garden.

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:36,360
It's not just a gardening tool, but it is something that has a long handle, and we use it to clear the ground of rocks or leaves.

49
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,560
Right, so just imagine it's kind of like a big brush for your garden.

50
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,780
It collects things, right?

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,300
Right.

52
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:56,639
It's like a big brush that's pulling things out of the ground or away from the ground, especially in the fall, like October or November, when all the leaves fall off the trees, and you have to take them off the grass.

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,439
You use a rake to pull them.

54
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,759
So you use a rake to pull them, and you also call the action of using a rake.

55
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,500
You say you rake the garden.

56
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:05,319
To rake.

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,159
That's right.

58
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,340
To rake the leaves.

59
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,479
I hate raking the leaves.

60
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:09,960
All right.

61
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:15,180
And now the other tool that we have is very common, not only in gardening, but for construction work for many things.

62
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,740
You have a shovel.

63
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:17,740
Shovel.

64
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:25,580
So a shovel is basically a big metal spoon, and you use it to make a hole in the ground.

65
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:26,500
Exactly.

66
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:36,680
So as we say, we use it a lot in gardening to make holes for maybe the plants, but also in construction, if you want to make a hole in the ground and things like this, you use a shovel.

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,560
And now a smaller version of the shovel that you use only with your hand.

68
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,139
This is called a spade.

69
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,259
A spade.

70
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:49,500
So this is very small, like you said, and it's actually special because of its shape.

71
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,979
A spade has a point.

72
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,740
A shovel is round, and a spade has a point.

73
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,680
And what's interesting, Marco, is it's actually very common somewhere else.

74
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,900
In cards.

75
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:01,000
That's right, in cards.

76
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:02,840
So cards have different shapes.

77
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,639
One is a heart.

78
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:04,479
One is a diamond.

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,020
One of them is a spade.

80
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:11,819
So the one that's pointy, that's called a spade, and it's used for digging kind of precision holes.

81
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:12,759
Right, exactly.

82
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,860
So maybe you don't want to use a big shovel.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,439
If you want to make maybe a small hole in the ground, you would use a spade.

84
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:25,360
And now our last tool has kind of a funny spelling.

85
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:28,439
It's h-o-e, and it's pronounced hoe.

86
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:29,259
Hoe.

87
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:38,139
So again, this is a tool with a very long handle, and you use it to maybe make the ground softer or to turn up the ground.

88
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:44,079
So when you're first starting to plant a garden, the ground is very hard, very tough, right?

89
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,420
And this is a really important tool for that period because you can basically turn up the ground.

90
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,000
You're not digging anything, but you're mixing up the dirt a little bit to make it softer.

91
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,199
Okay, very good.

92
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,139
So that's when you use this tool.

93
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,480
It's kind of a dirt or a soil mixer.

94
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,920
You can also pull out those nasty weeds with a hoe.

95
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,920
Okay, good.

96
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,779
So four key tools that we've just taken a look at now.

97
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:16,699
But now let's move on to two verbs that are basically very important when you're talking about gardening and all this.

98
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:25,240
As you mentioned, you talked about mixing the soil, and in the next line, we see that it says, I'll till the soil.

99
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,060
To till.

100
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,980
Okay, so basically this is a way of turning up that soil, but you're doing it kind of in lines, right?

101
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,920
So you're mixing up the soil and making it softer, preparing the soil for planting.

102
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,579
And so you till the soil.

103
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:41,779
Soil, of course, in this case, is that dirt.

104
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,379
It's earth.

105
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:42,819
Right.

106
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:43,339
It's earth.

107
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,839
So to till is to prepare it for planting.

108
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:47,759
Till the soil.

109
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:48,240
That's right.

110
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:48,819
To till the soil.

111
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,139
Okay.

112
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,000
And what do we do after the soil has been tilled?

113
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,220
Well, then we sow the seeds.

114
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,360
Okay, so seeds are baby plants, basically.

115
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,160
And we sow the seeds.

116
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,779
When we sow the seeds, we're putting the seeds into the ground.

117
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,379
So that's basically planting the seeds.

118
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,399
You can say we plant the seeds or we sow the seeds.

119
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,100
And the opposite of sowing?

120
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,339
The opposite of sowing is reaping, R-E-A-P, to reap.

121
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,279
So we actually have a phrase in English, this is very, very famous, very common, we say you reap what you sow.

122
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:27,819
You reap what you sow.

123
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,199
That's right.

124
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,439
Okay, so you basically collect what you planted and that's kind of what you do in life.

125
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,360
So we say if you haven't planted anything good, you're not going to reap anything good.

126
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:37,379
Exactly.

127
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,839
It's a very popular phrase.

128
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,199
All right.

129
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,279
So we've covered a lot of vocab here.

130
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,480
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,939
I've decided to grow my own garden.

132
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:52,579
What?

133
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
You don't know the first thing about gardening.

134
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,439
On the contrary, I've been reading a lot of books about the subject.

135
00:06:59,279 --> 00:06:59,600
Oh yeah?

136
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,019
Tell me then, smarty pants, how will you go about setting up your garden?

137
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,519
Well, first I need to buy some things such as fertilizer, seeds, and tools.

138
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,939
What type of tools?

139
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,240
You know, the basics.

140
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,339
A rake, shovel, spade, and a hoe.

141
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:13,959
Right.

142
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,740
Well, it seems like you have all your bases covered.

143
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:17,699
What's next?

144
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,199
I'll till the soil and then sow the seeds.

145
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,879
I'll then add some fertilizer and voila, gardening all done.

146
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,600
Well, good luck with your garden, especially considering we're in the dry season and it won't rain for the next three months.

147
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:36,420
All right.

148
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,120
We're back and we have four phrases for you on Fluency Builder and we're going to take a look at those now.

149
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,060
Fluency Builder.

150
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:50,660
This first phrase is useful in any conversation, I think, especially if you're trying to impress somebody.

151
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,279
So basically, one person in this dialogue says, you know what?

152
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:56,680
You don't know the first thing about gardening.

153
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,879
That means you don't know anything about gardening.

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,759
And what does he say in response?

155
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:02,000
On the contrary.

156
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,740
On the contrary.

157
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,379
So the contrary means the opposite.

158
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,779
So basically this means the opposite is true.

159
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,620
You're basically saying, I disagree.

160
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,060
What you are saying is false.

161
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,019
It's actually the opposite.

162
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,019
So maybe I have a feeling, Marco, that it's going to rain tomorrow.

163
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:24,120
Actually, on the contrary, I saw in the news that it's going to be very sunny tomorrow.

164
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,259
Oh, well, that's good news.

165
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,019
So that's a way of maybe politely disagreeing with someone or saying to someone that, well, you're wrong.

166
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,080
It's actually the opposite of what you're saying.

167
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:43,700
Moving on to our second phrase, it's actually a colloquial way of kind of making fun of someone when you say, all right, then smarty pants.

168
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:44,899
Okay.

169
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:45,860
Smarty pants.

170
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,659
Don't think about this too much.

171
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:50,179
We're not talking about pants, actually.

172
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,519
But this is a way of saying, okay, if you're so smart, then tell me that.

173
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:56,600
It's sarcasm.

174
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,879
It's sarcasm, exactly.

175
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,139
So this person says, oh, actually, I know a lot about gardening.

176
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,019
And the other person says, oh, really, smarty pants?

177
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:13,440
So you can actually describe a person in this way, maybe a person that thinks they know a lot or sometimes what you say a Mr.

178
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,019
Know-It-All.

179
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,940
You also say it's a smarty pants.

180
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,399
Right.

181
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,519
So someone who thinks they know a lot or everything even.

182
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:20,600
Mr.

183
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,659
Know-It-All or a smarty pants.

184
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:23,500
All right.

185
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:32,639
And our third phrase is interesting because we have a set up here when the person says, how will you go about setting up your garden?

186
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,080
Right.

187
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:33,659
Okay.

188
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:37,740
So to go about doing something, there's two important parts of this.

189
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,240
So, Marco, the first part is how you go about.

190
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:43,519
This means how you do.

191
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:43,879
Right.

192
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:46,639
So you're basically, how will you do this?

193
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:47,919
What's your approach?

194
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:48,919
What's your approach?

195
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,000
So how will you go about plus and then the verb and ING.

196
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:56,600
So how will you go about setting up your garden?

197
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,340
How will you start or what is your approach to creating your garden?

198
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:06,840
So maybe, Marco, you want to write a book and I can ask you, well, how will you go about starting your book?

199
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:07,419
Right.

200
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:12,960
Or if I'm writing a book, you can say, how will you go about investigating for your book?

201
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,419
So what is the approach you're going to take?

202
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:16,419
How will you do it?

203
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,980
How do you plan on doing something?

204
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,460
And our final phrase here is very commonly used for all sorts of situations.

205
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,840
Basically, if a person is prepared, you say, well, you have all your bases covered.

206
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,360
Okay.

207
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,480
This is a great phrase.

208
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,039
It comes right from sports.

209
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,879
Very common in English to have sports phrases.

210
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,820
This comes from the sport baseball.

211
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,659
So in baseball, the field is a diamond.

212
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,620
There are four corners or four bases, and the runners have to go from one base to the other one, two, three, four, and then they get a point.

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,960
But in this case, we're saying the other team, they have their bases covered.

214
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,779
That means they're protecting their bases.

215
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,779
And in speech, we say, if you have your bases covered, like you said, Marco, you're very well prepared.

216
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,559
So you're ready.

217
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,419
You're prepared.

218
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:12,279
You have really planned out and thought of what you're going to do, so you have all your bases covered.

219
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:21,639
So, Marco, for example, you just told me that it's going to be sunny tomorrow, but I think it still might rain, so to have all my bases covered, I'm going to bring an umbrella anyway.

220
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,320
Just in case.

221
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:22,980
Just in case.

222
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:33,960
Or maybe you have a presentation at work, and you've prepared your PowerPoint presentation, you have your drawings, your copies, you have everything ready, you have all your bases covered for that meeting.

223
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,519
That's right.

224
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,019
Okay.

225
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:40,799
So why don't we go back and listen to our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

226
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,860
What type of tools?

227
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,220
You know, the basics.

228
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,320
A rake, shovel, spade, and a hoe.

229
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:10,940
Right.

230
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,639
Well, it seems like you have all your bases covered.

231
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,679
What's next?

232
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,139
I'll till the soil, and then sow the seeds.

233
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:20,820
I'll then add some fertilizer, and voila, gardening all done.

234
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,539
Well, good luck with your garden, especially considering we're in the dry season, and it won't rain for the next three months.

235
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:36,779
All right, we're back.

236
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:40,100
So gardening is actually a very popular thing in many countries.

237
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:49,879
I know many people as well who prefer to have their own personal garden to grow their own vegetables, which they say tastes a lot different from the ones you buy at the supermarket.

238
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,559
They do.

239
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,960
I think personally that homegrown vegetables, so vegetables that you grow yourself, tend to taste a lot better than the ones you get in the grocery store.

240
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:58,899
They also look different.

241
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,100
They're not as pretty.

242
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,639
Right.

243
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,679
But that's because they have less chemicals.

244
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:03,820
Yeah.

245
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:15,600
So I think it's a very popular thing, and well, not only gardening your own vegetables, but some people just enjoy it as a hobby to have some plants and different types of things in their backyard.

246
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,259
Yeah.

247
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,840
Many people say it's very relaxing.

248
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:22,399
You get to go outside, you're in the sunshine, it's a very calming activity.

249
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:22,820
Yeah.

250
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,080
It seems like it's very relaxing.

251
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,220
A little bit boring at times.

252
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,500
Basically you're waiting for your plants to grow, but I imagine that once they do, you've accomplished it.

253
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,799
It must be great to see that you've actually brought life.

254
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,720
I'm sure.

255
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,139
Like 20 minutes every day.

256
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,840
It's not so bad.

257
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:38,200
Yeah.

258
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:38,620
Yeah.

259
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:45,759
It's actually a very interesting hobby, and we want to know if, well, if in your country or in your town, do you have enough space for a garden?

260
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,139
Do you like gardening or maybe growing your own food?

261
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,500
I think that's a very interesting topic.

262
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:50,700
Yeah.

263
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,539
Let us know what you think.

264
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,299
Do you do this?

265
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:53,480
Do you have friends who garden?

266
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,620
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

267
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,519
We hope to see you there.

268
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:56,899
All right.

269
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:57,299
Bye.

270
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:57,639
Bye.

271
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,019
Bye.
