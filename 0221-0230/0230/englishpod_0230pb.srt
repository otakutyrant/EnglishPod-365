00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and today we're going outside for our lesson.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today we are gardening.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are going to set up our own garden.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, that means growing plants and maybe even food.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So let's take a listen to this dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about it.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I've decided to grow my own garden.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You don't know the first thing about gardening.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
On the contrary, I've been reading a lot of books about the subject.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh yeah?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Tell me then, smarty pants, how will you go about setting up your garden?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, first I need to buy some things such as fertilizer, seeds, and tools.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What type of tools?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You know, the basics.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A rake, shovel, spade, and a hoe.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Right.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, it seems like you have all your bases covered.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What's next?

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll till the soil and then sow the seeds.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll then add some fertilizer, and voila.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Gardening all done.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, good luck with your garden, especially considering we're in the dry season and it won't rain for the next three months.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
All right, we're back.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So a lot of vocab related to gardening.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We mentioned a lot of tools, and we're going to explain a lot of those now on Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay, so gardening has some very special tools, like you said, Marco.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The first one is one that I am not, well, it's actually not a tool.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's a part of gardening, something that we use to help the plants grow, and I really don't like it because it smells bad.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Exactly.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It smells kind of bad, and it has a very strong smell.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And that is called fertilizer.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Fertilizer.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So basically, fertilizer is something that you use in a garden to help the plants grow better.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Right.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I think it has a lot of vitamins and minerals that the plant needs to grow better, faster, stronger.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Fertilizer.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, good.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And well, now we're going to mention four tools that we use in gardening, basic tools.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The first one being a rake.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
A rake.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Rake.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Rake.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So a rake is actually something that's very common in most houses, especially houses with a yard or a garden.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not just a gardening tool, but it is something that has a long handle, and we use it to clear the ground of rocks or leaves.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Right, so just imagine it's kind of like a big brush for your garden.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It collects things, right?

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Right.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's like a big brush that's pulling things out of the ground or away from the ground, especially in the fall, like October or November, when all the leaves fall off the trees, and you have to take them off the grass.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You use a rake to pull them.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So you use a rake to pull them, and you also call the action of using a rake.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You say you rake the garden.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
To rake.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
To rake the leaves.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I hate raking the leaves.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
All right.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And now the other tool that we have is very common, not only in gardening, but for construction work for many things.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You have a shovel.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Shovel.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So a shovel is basically a big metal spoon, and you use it to make a hole in the ground.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Exactly.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So as we say, we use it a lot in gardening to make holes for maybe the plants, but also in construction, if you want to make a hole in the ground and things like this, you use a shovel.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And now a smaller version of the shovel that you use only with your hand.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is called a spade.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
A spade.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So this is very small, like you said, and it's actually special because of its shape.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
A spade has a point.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
A shovel is round, and a spade has a point.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And what's interesting, Marco, is it's actually very common somewhere else.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
In cards.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's right, in cards.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So cards have different shapes.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
One is a heart.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
One is a diamond.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
One of them is a spade.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So the one that's pointy, that's called a spade, and it's used for digging kind of precision holes.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Right, exactly.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So maybe you don't want to use a big shovel.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If you want to make maybe a small hole in the ground, you would use a spade.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And now our last tool has kind of a funny spelling.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's h-o-e, and it's pronounced hoe.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hoe.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So again, this is a tool with a very long handle, and you use it to maybe make the ground softer or to turn up the ground.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So when you're first starting to plant a garden, the ground is very hard, very tough, right?

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And this is a really important tool for that period because you can basically turn up the ground.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're not digging anything, but you're mixing up the dirt a little bit to make it softer.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, very good.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So that's when you use this tool.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's kind of a dirt or a soil mixer.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You can also pull out those nasty weeds with a hoe.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay, good.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So four key tools that we've just taken a look at now.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But now let's move on to two verbs that are basically very important when you're talking about gardening and all this.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
As you mentioned, you talked about mixing the soil, and in the next line, we see that it says, I'll till the soil.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
To till.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay, so basically this is a way of turning up that soil, but you're doing it kind of in lines, right?

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So you're mixing up the soil and making it softer, preparing the soil for planting.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And so you till the soil.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Soil, of course, in this case, is that dirt.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's earth.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Right.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's earth.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So to till is to prepare it for planting.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Till the soil.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's right.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
To till the soil.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And what do we do after the soil has been tilled?

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Well, then we sow the seeds.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, so seeds are baby plants, basically.

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And we sow the seeds.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
When we sow the seeds, we're putting the seeds into the ground.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So that's basically planting the seeds.

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You can say we plant the seeds or we sow the seeds.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And the opposite of sowing?

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The opposite of sowing is reaping, R-E-A-P, to reap.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So we actually have a phrase in English, this is very, very famous, very common, we say you reap what you sow.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You reap what you sow.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's right.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay, so you basically collect what you planted and that's kind of what you do in life.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So we say if you haven't planted anything good, you're not going to reap anything good.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Exactly.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's a very popular phrase.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All right.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So we've covered a lot of vocab here.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I've decided to grow my own garden.

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What?

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You don't know the first thing about gardening.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
On the contrary, I've been reading a lot of books about the subject.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh yeah?

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Tell me then, smarty pants, how will you go about setting up your garden?

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, first I need to buy some things such as fertilizer, seeds, and tools.

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What type of tools?

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You know, the basics.

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
A rake, shovel, spade, and a hoe.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Right.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, it seems like you have all your bases covered.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's next?

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll till the soil and then sow the seeds.

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll then add some fertilizer and voila, gardening all done.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, good luck with your garden, especially considering we're in the dry season and it won't rain for the next three months.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All right.

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We're back and we have four phrases for you on Fluency Builder and we're going to take a look at those now.

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Fluency Builder.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This first phrase is useful in any conversation, I think, especially if you're trying to impress somebody.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So basically, one person in this dialogue says, you know what?

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You don't know the first thing about gardening.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That means you don't know anything about gardening.

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And what does he say in response?

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
On the contrary.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
On the contrary.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So the contrary means the opposite.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So basically this means the opposite is true.

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're basically saying, I disagree.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What you are saying is false.

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's actually the opposite.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So maybe I have a feeling, Marco, that it's going to rain tomorrow.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Actually, on the contrary, I saw in the news that it's going to be very sunny tomorrow.

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, well, that's good news.

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So that's a way of maybe politely disagreeing with someone or saying to someone that, well, you're wrong.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's actually the opposite of what you're saying.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Moving on to our second phrase, it's actually a colloquial way of kind of making fun of someone when you say, all right, then smarty pants.

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay.

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Smarty pants.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't think about this too much.

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We're not talking about pants, actually.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But this is a way of saying, okay, if you're so smart, then tell me that.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's sarcasm.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's sarcasm, exactly.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So this person says, oh, actually, I know a lot about gardening.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And the other person says, oh, really, smarty pants?

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So you can actually describe a person in this way, maybe a person that thinks they know a lot or sometimes what you say a Mr.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Know-It-All.

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You also say it's a smarty pants.

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Right.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So someone who thinks they know a lot or everything even.

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Mr.

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Know-It-All or a smarty pants.

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
All right.

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And our third phrase is interesting because we have a set up here when the person says, how will you go about setting up your garden?

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Right.

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay.

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So to go about doing something, there's two important parts of this.

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So, Marco, the first part is how you go about.

190
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This means how you do.

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Right.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So you're basically, how will you do this?

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What's your approach?

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What's your approach?

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So how will you go about plus and then the verb and ING.

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So how will you go about setting up your garden?

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How will you start or what is your approach to creating your garden?

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So maybe, Marco, you want to write a book and I can ask you, well, how will you go about starting your book?

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Right.

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Or if I'm writing a book, you can say, how will you go about investigating for your book?

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So what is the approach you're going to take?

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
How will you do it?

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How do you plan on doing something?

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And our final phrase here is very commonly used for all sorts of situations.

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Basically, if a person is prepared, you say, well, you have all your bases covered.

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay.

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This is a great phrase.

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It comes right from sports.

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Very common in English to have sports phrases.

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This comes from the sport baseball.

211
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So in baseball, the field is a diamond.

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There are four corners or four bases, and the runners have to go from one base to the other one, two, three, four, and then they get a point.

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But in this case, we're saying the other team, they have their bases covered.

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That means they're protecting their bases.

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And in speech, we say, if you have your bases covered, like you said, Marco, you're very well prepared.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So you're ready.

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're prepared.

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You have really planned out and thought of what you're going to do, so you have all your bases covered.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So, Marco, for example, you just told me that it's going to be sunny tomorrow, but I think it still might rain, so to have all my bases covered, I'm going to bring an umbrella anyway.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Just in case.

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Just in case.

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Or maybe you have a presentation at work, and you've prepared your PowerPoint presentation, you have your drawings, your copies, you have everything ready, you have all your bases covered for that meeting.

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's right.

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay.

225
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So why don't we go back and listen to our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

226
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What type of tools?

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You know, the basics.

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
A rake, shovel, spade, and a hoe.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Right.

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Well, it seems like you have all your bases covered.

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What's next?

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll till the soil, and then sow the seeds.

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll then add some fertilizer, and voila, gardening all done.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Well, good luck with your garden, especially considering we're in the dry season, and it won't rain for the next three months.

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
All right, we're back.

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So gardening is actually a very popular thing in many countries.

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I know many people as well who prefer to have their own personal garden to grow their own vegetables, which they say tastes a lot different from the ones you buy at the supermarket.

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They do.

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I think personally that homegrown vegetables, so vegetables that you grow yourself, tend to taste a lot better than the ones you get in the grocery store.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,000
They also look different.

241
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They're not as pretty.

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Right.

243
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But that's because they have less chemicals.

244
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah.

245
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So I think it's a very popular thing, and well, not only gardening your own vegetables, but some people just enjoy it as a hobby to have some plants and different types of things in their backyard.

246
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah.

247
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Many people say it's very relaxing.

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You get to go outside, you're in the sunshine, it's a very calming activity.

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah.

250
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It seems like it's very relaxing.

251
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A little bit boring at times.

252
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Basically you're waiting for your plants to grow, but I imagine that once they do, you've accomplished it.

253
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It must be great to see that you've actually brought life.

254
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sure.

255
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Like 20 minutes every day.

256
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's not so bad.

257
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah.

258
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah.

259
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's actually a very interesting hobby, and we want to know if, well, if in your country or in your town, do you have enough space for a garden?

260
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Do you like gardening or maybe growing your own food?

261
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think that's a very interesting topic.

262
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah.

263
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Let us know what you think.

264
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you do this?

265
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Do you have friends who garden?

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

267
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We hope to see you there.

268
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,000
All right.

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Bye.

270
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Bye.

271
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Bye.
