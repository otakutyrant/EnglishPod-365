00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com I've decided to grow my own garden.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You don't know the first thing about gardening.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
On the contrary, I've been reading a lot of books about the subject.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh yeah?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tell me then, smarty pants.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
How will you go about setting up your garden?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, first I need to buy some things such as fertilizer, seeds, and tools.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What type of tools?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You know, the basics.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
A rake, shovel, spade, and a hoe.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Right.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, it seems like you have all your bases covered.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's next?

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll till the soil and then sow the seeds.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll then add some fertilizer and voila!

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Gardening all done!

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, good luck with your garden, especially considering we're in the dry season and it won't rain for the next three months.
