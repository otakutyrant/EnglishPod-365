00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:07,599
EnglishPod.com I've decided to grow my own garden.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:08,199
What?

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,720
You don't know the first thing about gardening.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,080
On the contrary, I've been reading a lot of books about the subject.

5
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:15,240
Oh yeah?

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,859
Tell me then, smarty pants.

7
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:19,699
How will you go about setting up your garden?

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,160
Well, first I need to buy some things such as fertilizer, seeds, and tools.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,640
What type of tools?

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,879
You know, the basics.

11
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:29,000
A rake, shovel, spade, and a hoe.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,620
Right.

13
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:32,359
Well, it seems like you have all your bases covered.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,399
What's next?

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,840
I'll till the soil and then sow the seeds.

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,159
I'll then add some fertilizer and voila!

17
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,500
Gardening all done!

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,240
Well, good luck with your garden, especially considering we're in the dry season and it won't rain for the next three months.
