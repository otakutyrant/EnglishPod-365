00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:09,119
EnglishPod.com Oh George, what a beautiful day it is.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,619
The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there.

3
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,519
What a perfect day to be at the beach.

4
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,320
The kids are going to have so much fun and will be able to relax in the sun while they're playing.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,359
It does seem like the perfect day.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,980
I'm glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,339
This looks like the perfect spot.

8
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:32,439
Okay kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp.

9
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:35,299
Here Mary, help me lay down these beach towels.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,539
There we go.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,020
Can you help me with the umbrella?

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,079
Perfect.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,659
Okay kids, here's a beach ball and a frisbee, a pail and a shovel.

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,820
I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave.

15
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:49,479
Don't stray too far.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,460
Wait, leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,179
And stay in the shallow area.

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,920
I don't want to see you go any further than that sandbar.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,579
It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floaties.

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,840
You're back already.

21
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,820
The water was too cold, huh?

22
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,439
I'll tell you a secret.

23
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,200
Do you see that small pool of water over there?

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,859
It'll be warmer in there.

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,959
Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows.

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,140
Ah!

27
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,099
What is that?

28
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,260
A jellyfish?

29
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:17,420
Jeremy, put that down right now.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,480
It could sting you.

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,359
Ah!

32
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:20,700
Not on me!

33
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:21,700
Ah!
