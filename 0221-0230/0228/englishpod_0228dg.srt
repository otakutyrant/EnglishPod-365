00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Oh George, what a beautiful day it is.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What a perfect day to be at the beach.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The kids are going to have so much fun and will be able to relax in the sun while they're playing.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It does seem like the perfect day.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This looks like the perfect spot.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Here Mary, help me lay down these beach towels.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There we go.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Can you help me with the umbrella?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Perfect.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay kids, here's a beach ball and a frisbee, a pail and a shovel.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Don't stray too far.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Wait, leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And stay in the shallow area.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't want to see you go any further than that sandbar.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floaties.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're back already.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The water was too cold, huh?

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll tell you a secret.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Do you see that small pool of water over there?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It'll be warmer in there.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Ah!

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What is that?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
A jellyfish?

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Jeremy, put that down right now.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It could sting you.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Ah!

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Not on me!

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ah!
