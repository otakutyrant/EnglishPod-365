00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,080
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,879
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,339
My name is Katherine, and today we've got an intermediate level lesson all about going to the beach.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,240
That's right.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,079
You know, it's a very popular thing to do, especially during the summer.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,679
It's hot.

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,480
You want to go maybe to the beach to lay on the sand and maybe get some color.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,620
Yeah, and also swim in the ocean.

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:25,219
Yeah.

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,339
Yeah, it's a nice way to cool off when it's really hot in the summer.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,000
That's right.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,100
So we're going to talk about the beach and a lot of vocab that we find related to this activity.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,619
But before we get into the dialogue, we have a word for you on Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,780
Vocabulary Preview.

15
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:45,600
So the key word today here is jellyfish.

16
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:46,719
Jellyfish.

17
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,640
So jellyfish is actually an animal, right?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,520
That's right.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,560
It's a very dangerous animal.

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,100
It's a small little animal.

21
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,140
So these things live in the water, and they often live in shallow areas, and they can sting you.

22
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,000
That's right.

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:09,000
They look like little plastic bags with little strings attached to it.

24
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,420
And they just float around, and if you happen to touch one, it hurts a lot.

25
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,579
Yeah, it can be very painful.

26
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,760
So jellyfish is our word today.

27
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:21,420
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a minute to talk more about what's going on.

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,239
Oh, George, what a beautiful day it is.

29
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:34,739
The sun is hot, and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there.

30
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,640
What a perfect day to be at the beach.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,420
The kids are going to have so much fun, and we'll be able to relax in the sun while they're playing.

32
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,500
It does seem like the perfect day.

33
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,099
I'm glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather.

34
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:50,459
This looks like the perfect spot.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,560
Okay, kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp.

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,400
Here, Mary, help me lay down these beach towels.

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,680
There we go.

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,159
Can you help me with the umbrella?

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,200
Perfect.

40
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,780
Okay, kids, here's a beach ball and a Frisbee, a pail and a shovel.

41
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,939
I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave.

42
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,599
Don't stray too far.

43
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,599
Wait, leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,300
And stay in the shallow area.

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,060
I don't want to see you go any further than that sandbar.

46
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,699
It's too deep out there, and we didn't bring your floaties.

47
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,960
You're back already.

48
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,960
The water was too cold, huh?

49
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,560
I'll tell you a secret.

50
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,319
Do you see that small pool of water over there?

51
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,979
It'll be warmer in there.

52
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,099
Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows.

53
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,259
Ah!

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,240
What is that?

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,400
A jellyfish?

56
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,539
Jeremy, put that down right now.

57
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,620
It could sting you.

58
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,460
Ah!

59
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:42,840
Not on me!

60
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:43,900
Ah!

61
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,819
All right, great, we're back.

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,500
So now why don't we take a look at four keywords that we have prepared for you today on language takeaway.

63
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,099
Language takeaway.

64
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:06,280
First up, we have a very important thing to bring to the beach, especially if you're like me and you burn easily.

65
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,400
So this thing is called sunscreen.

66
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,080
Okay, sunscreen.

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,520
Now, this is a liquid, and you put it on your skin, right?

68
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,419
And this protects you from the sun.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,360
So basically you put this cream all over your body to prevent sunburns, to prevent burning under the sun.

70
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,000
It's very important.

71
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,199
So it's called sunscreen or also sometimes called sunblock.

72
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:32,080
That's right.

73
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,159
Okay, very good.

74
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:41,580
Now, we have our sunscreen, and we arrive to the beach, and one of the parents say, all right, we're going to set up camp.

75
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,800
Okay, to set up camp.

76
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:53,139
Well, this might be confusing because as many of you know, camp, camping, this is an activity, but we're not actually camping here.

77
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,199
We're just going to be at the beach for one day.

78
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,560
So to set up camp means to organize or arrange ourselves in a place.

79
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:07,460
So it's a colloquial way of saying we are going to organize the area where we're going to spend the day.

80
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,159
We're going to make ourselves comfortable.

81
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:10,879
So you set up camp.

82
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,800
So not necessarily that you're going to camp there, but that you're going to prepare the area.

83
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:18,680
So this could be used in many other different areas, right?

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,500
That's right.

85
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:29,339
So sometimes when tickets for really popular concerts go on sale, people line up for days before they can buy the tickets.

86
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,939
Well, if you're in line, you maybe want to set up camp.

87
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,860
That means make yourself comfortable, sit down, bring a book, open some food packages.

88
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,120
Exactly.

89
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,540
So to set up camp.

90
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,720
And well, when we go to the beach, we want to sit down or lay down on the sand.

91
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:51,019
And in order to do this, we usually bring along beach towels.

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,959
That's right, Marco.

93
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,300
So towels can be any kind of towel.

94
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,600
You have a towel in your bathroom or in your kitchen.

95
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,519
Basically a piece of cloth that you use to dry yourself.

96
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:04,899
But the special kind of towel we bring to the beach is called, of course, a beach towel.

97
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,420
These are usually much bigger than normal towels.

98
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,079
Yeah, they're very, very big.

99
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:14,040
And this is usually because you want to lay down on the sand on top of this towel, right?

100
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,519
That's right.

101
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,240
Okay.

102
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:21,699
And the last word that we have for language takeaway is a beach umbrella or just an umbrella.

103
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,459
That's right.

104
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:30,139
So maybe you're lying down on this big, comfortable, soft beach towel and you're afraid of being under the sun too much.

105
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,459
So an umbrella is a way to protect yourself from the sun.

106
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,060
It provides shade.

107
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,100
That's right.

108
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:45,519
So it's called an umbrella or usually if you want to distinguish between the umbrella you use for the rain, you can call it a beach umbrella.

109
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,019
That's right.

110
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:46,540
Okay.

111
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,480
And these are usually a lot bigger and you don't actually carry them around in your hand.

112
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,819
You have to put them into the sand.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,259
That's right.

114
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,160
So it stands alone.

115
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,680
Okay.

116
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,040
So four key phrases there for you on language takeaway.

117
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,620
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back shortly.

118
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,300
Oh George, what a beautiful day it is.

119
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,800
The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there.

120
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,680
What a perfect day to be at the beach.

121
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:19,480
The kids are going to have so much fun and we'll be able to relax in the sun while they're playing.

122
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,540
It does seem like the perfect day.

123
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather.

124
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,519
This looks like the perfect spot.

125
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,620
Okay kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp.

126
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,459
Here Mary, help me lay down these beach towels.

127
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,720
There we go.

128
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,199
Can you help me with the umbrella?

129
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,220
Perfect.

130
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,819
Okay kids, here's a beach ball and a frisbee, a pail and a shovel.

131
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,000
I want to see an impressive sand castle by the time we leave.

132
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,639
Don't stray too far.

133
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,639
Wait, leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,339
And stay in the shallow area.

135
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:57,100
I don't want to see you go any further than that sandbar.

136
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,759
It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floaties.

137
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,019
You're back already.

138
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,980
The water was too cold, huh?

139
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,620
I'll tell you a secret.

140
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,379
Do you see that small pool of water over there?

141
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,019
It'll be warmer in there.

142
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,120
Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows.

143
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,319
Ah!

144
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:14,279
What is that?

145
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:15,439
A jellyfish?

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,579
Jeremy, put that down right now.

147
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,639
It could sting you.

148
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,500
Ah!

149
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,879
Not on me!

150
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,899
Ah!

151
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:26,920
All right, we're back.

152
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,439
So now we have five more words that we're going to take a look at in Language Takeaway Part 2.

153
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,899
Okay, so there are lots of fun things to do at the beach.

154
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,759
And today we're not going to be talking about all of them because there are too many things.

155
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,240
But one fun activity is playing frisbee.

156
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:48,079
That's right.

157
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,779
Frisbee.

158
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,060
So this is a thing.

159
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,959
It's an object, a frisbee.

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,899
Or you also play frisbee.

161
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:54,519
That's right.

162
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,620
So a frisbee itself is usually made of plastic and it's like a plate.

163
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,879
And it's very light and you throw it to your friends and it sails through the air.

164
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,699
Right, it kind of flies along the air and then somebody else has to catch it.

165
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,379
That's right.

166
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,220
So you can play frisbee or throw the frisbee.

167
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,220
It's very popular with people playing frisbee with their dogs, right?

168
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,220
You throw the frisbee and the dog chases it.

169
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,519
Dogs love frisbee.

170
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,740
All right.

171
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,899
Another great activity that usually we do when we go to the beach is we build sandcastles.

172
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,360
Okay, so I'm a master sandcastle builder.

173
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,139
I'm a really big fan of this activity.

174
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,860
Basically you use water and sand to create castles.

175
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:36,399
Right.

176
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,960
And obviously you have to use tools like shovels and buckets.

177
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,419
Otherwise it might look kind of funny.

178
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,100
And this is actually such a popular activity that there are even competitions at times.

179
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:59,059
People will not only build castles or houses or structures, but maybe a statue of some sort or an animal or different things.

180
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,919
That's right, or people.

181
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:00,759
People, yeah.

182
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,179
So sandcastle.

183
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:02,740
Okay.

184
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,220
And well, whenever we go to the beach, the ocean can be a little bit dangerous.

185
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,620
And that's why in the dialogue, one of the parents told their kids to stay in the shallow area of the water.

186
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,620
That's right.

187
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,500
So shallow is, it describes depth, so how deep something is.

188
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,299
Something is shallow, it's not very deep.

189
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,279
Okay, so there's very little water.

190
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,139
But if there's a lot of water, maybe if you swim and you can't touch your feet on the ground, we call that deep.

191
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,379
So shallow is very low water and deep is lots and lots of water.

192
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,320
Okay, very good.

193
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,559
So you'll usually find this in the ocean.

194
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,899
If you go further, further, further in, it'll get deeper and deeper and deeper.

195
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:47,940
And more and more dangerous.

196
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,840
And this is why the mom also told the kid to not pass that sandbar that was ahead.

197
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,279
Okay, sandbar.

198
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:03,360
This is a piece of sand that basically rises very high in the water.

199
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:10,840
So usually when you're on the beach and you go into the water and it gets deeper and deeper and then all of a sudden it gets high again and there's more sand.

200
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,159
And so that part that you can stand on, that sand out in the water, that's called a sandbar.

201
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,299
It's almost like a little island.

202
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,240
Yeah, exactly.

203
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:22,399
And as you said, usually it gets deeper, deeper, then you have the sandbar.

204
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,259
So it gets higher.

205
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,080
But usually if you pass the sandbar, it's going to get really deep all of a sudden.

206
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:27,700
That's right.

207
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,759
So that's why the mother doesn't want her child to go past the sandbar.

208
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,240
Right.

209
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:42,200
And well, if you're ever swimming in a swimming pool in the ocean, it's always a good idea if you don't know how to swim well or if you have children to take along little floaties.

210
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,820
Okay, floaties.

211
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,000
I like this word.

212
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:54,580
Floaties are plastic rings that you put around your arms or maybe around your stomach and they're filled with air.

213
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,240
So when you go in the water, they help you float.

214
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:03,059
So this is a very common thing to put on children because they don't know how to swim well.

215
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,039
You put them little floaties on their arms or around their stomachs and then they can just float and they won't drown.

216
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:09,799
That's right.

217
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:10,659
Floaties.

218
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:11,700
Very good.

219
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,700
So a lot of key words there are related to the fun of going to the beach.

220
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,860
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue for the very last time.

221
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,960
Oh, George, what a beautiful day it is.

222
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:32,460
The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there.

223
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,360
What a perfect day to be at the beach.

224
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,120
The kids are going to have so much fun and we'll be able to relax in the sun while they're playing.

225
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,240
It does seem like the perfect day.

226
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,799
I'm glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather.

227
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,159
This looks like the perfect spot.

228
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,299
Okay kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp.

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,139
Here Mary, help me lay down these beach towels.

230
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:56,379
There we go.

231
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,879
Can you help me with the umbrella?

232
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:58,899
Perfect.

233
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:03,500
Okay kids, here's a beach ball and a frisbee, a pail and a shovel.

234
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,659
I want to see an impressive sand castle by the time we leave.

235
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,299
Don't stray too far.

236
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,299
Wait, leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.

237
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,000
And stay in the shallow area.

238
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,759
I don't want to see you go any further than that sandbar.

239
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,419
It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floaties.

240
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,679
You're back already.

241
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,679
The water was too cold, huh?

242
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,299
I'll tell you a secret.

243
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,039
Do you see that small pool of water over there?

244
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,679
It'll be warmer in there.

245
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:31,799
Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows.

246
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,960
Ah, what is that?

247
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,120
A jellyfish?

248
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,240
Jeremy, put that down right now.

249
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,399
It could sting you.

250
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,559
Ah, not on me.

251
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,000
All right, so beach activities.

252
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,120
You say you're a master sand castle builder.

253
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:53,700
I love building sand castles.

254
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,980
I won't say that I'm very good at it, maybe not a professional, but I do a pretty good sand castle.

255
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,259
Do you like getting buried in the sand?

256
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,179
I love it.

257
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:03,419
Really?

258
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,860
Although it also scares me.

259
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,179
Have you ever had someone maybe cover you with sand and then you can't move?

260
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:08,700
Yeah.

261
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,720
Yeah, so it's a little bit scary.

262
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:16,519
Obviously, I'm not very comfortable with having my head covered, but some people even do that.

263
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,679
They cover their entire body, head to toe.

264
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,240
How do they breathe?

265
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:23,159
And they have a straw out of their mouth to breathe.

266
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:23,679
Wow.

267
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:34,960
I actually love going to the beach and it's relaxing, it's really fun, but I don't really enjoy it going when there are a lot of people because I like to relax on the beach.

268
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:41,120
But when there are too many people, they're running around, there are kids running around and it's not very relaxing.

269
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:41,960
Yeah, I hear you.

270
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,399
But swimming in the ocean is also very dangerous, right?

271
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,720
It can be, it can be.

272
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:53,139
So we recommend you go places where there are lifeguards on duty or that you go with an expert swimmer.

273
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:54,120
Lifeguards, very good.

274
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,320
That's all we've got though for today.

275
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,100
We hope you've enjoyed this lesson and we hope you're excited about the upcoming summer months.

276
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,320
If you have any questions or comments, please do visit our website, EnglishPod.com.

277
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,379
All right, we'll see you guys there.

278
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:05,700
Bye.

279
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:05,960
Bye.
