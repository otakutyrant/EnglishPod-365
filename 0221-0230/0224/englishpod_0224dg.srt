00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Alright Officer McGraw, give it to me straight.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What are we looking at here?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Detective McGee, we're glad to see you.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We could sure use your expertise on this one.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's a break-in, but nothing seems to have been stolen.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We received a call from the Baer family at around 10.30 this morning.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
They had gone out for a walk before breakfast and came home to this mess.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Broken chairs and porridge all over the place.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Apparently Mama Baer had made the porridge a little too hot, you see.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They were waiting for it to cool down.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay then, let's start examining the evidence.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Have the forensics team been in yet?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes sir.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They found some fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hopefully they will be able to identify the burglar soon.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hmm.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Aha!

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's this?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A strand of golden hair.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is a very important piece of trace evidence, McGraw.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It tells me the suspect has long golden hair, and very few men have long golden hair.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So our criminal could be a woman.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
A woman?

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Was she working alone?

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Did she have an accomplice?

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
An accomplice?

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, no McGraw.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
She was definitely working alone.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
See here, there are footprints in the porridge.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Here on the floor, small footprints.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This tells me that our suspect is small, and could possibly be a child.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A child?

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Surely not, sir.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We must follow the clues, McGraw.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The evidence doesn't lie.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now, let's reconstruct the crime.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The suspect came in, sat in each chair, breaking the smallest one into little pieces.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Next, the porridge.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
She obviously tried to eat it, and because it was so hot, she dropped it on the floor.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Making this mess.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hmm.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Interesting.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
These footprints seem to lead upstairs.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
McGraw, did your officers clear the scene?

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, there was no one down here.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Maybe we forgot to check upstairs.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hey, what's with all the noise?

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm trying to sleep up here.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There she is!

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Get her!
