00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:09,560
EnglishPod.com Alright Officer McGraw, give it to me straight.

2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:11,060
What are we looking at here?

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,500
Detective McGee, we're glad to see you.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,219
We could sure use your expertise on this one.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,160
It's a break-in, but nothing seems to have been stolen.

6
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:22,980
We received a call from the Baer family at around 10.30 this morning.

7
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:27,000
They had gone out for a walk before breakfast and came home to this mess.

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,399
Broken chairs and porridge all over the place.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,380
Apparently Mama Baer had made the porridge a little too hot, you see.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,840
They were waiting for it to cool down.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,060
Okay then, let's start examining the evidence.

12
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,200
Have the forensics team been in yet?

13
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:42,979
Yes sir.

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,979
They found some fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak.

15
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,420
Hopefully they will be able to identify the burglar soon.

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,399
Hmm.

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,060
Aha!

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,500
What's this?

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,200
A strand of golden hair.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,500
This is a very important piece of trace evidence, McGraw.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,120
It tells me the suspect has long golden hair, and very few men have long golden hair.

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,359
So our criminal could be a woman.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,840
A woman?

24
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,299
Was she working alone?

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,340
Did she have an accomplice?

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,939
An accomplice?

27
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,159
No, no McGraw.

28
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,840
She was definitely working alone.

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,280
See here, there are footprints in the porridge.

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,560
Here on the floor, small footprints.

31
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,140
This tells me that our suspect is small, and could possibly be a child.

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:29,939
A child?

33
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,700
Surely not, sir.

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,219
We must follow the clues, McGraw.

35
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,819
The evidence doesn't lie.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,799
Now, let's reconstruct the crime.

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,219
The suspect came in, sat in each chair, breaking the smallest one into little pieces.

38
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:45,060
Next, the porridge.

39
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,540
She obviously tried to eat it, and because it was so hot, she dropped it on the floor.

40
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,379
Making this mess.

41
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,700
Hmm.

42
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,700
Interesting.

43
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:55,599
These footprints seem to lead upstairs.

44
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
McGraw, did your officers clear the scene?

45
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,379
Well, there was no one down here.

46
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,620
Maybe we forgot to check upstairs.

47
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,799
Hey, what's with all the noise?

48
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm trying to sleep up here.

49
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,439
There she is!

50
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,199
Get her!
