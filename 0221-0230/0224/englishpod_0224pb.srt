00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,259
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:05,980
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,720
My name is Katherine, and we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you guys today.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,320
This one is all about a crime scene.

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:15,179
That's right.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,199
So we are going to be at a crime scene.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:28,600
We are with the police officers, and we're going to take a look at some very, very interesting and specific vocab to, like, police and a crime and all that.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,120
That's right.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:39,079
So if you are a fan of the TV show CSI, or you like some of these investigation police work TV shows, this is a lesson for you.

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:39,679
That's right.

11
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,899
So why don't we go and listen to the dialogue for the first time?

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,060
All right, Officer McGraw, give it to me straight.

13
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,500
What are we looking at here?

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,000
Detective McGee.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,039
We're glad to see you.

16
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,719
We could sure use your expertise on this one.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,459
It's a break-in, but nothing seems to have been stolen, and we received a call from the Bear family at around 1030 this morning.

18
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:09,459
They had gone out for a walk before breakfast and came home to this mess.

19
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,879
Broken chairs and porridge all over the place.

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,359
Apparently Mama Bear had made the porridge a little too hot, you see, and they were waiting for it to cool down.

21
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:21,579
Okay then, let's start examining the evidence.

22
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,719
Have the forensics team been in yet?

23
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,480
Yes sir.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,540
They found some fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak.

25
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,939
Hopefully they will be able to identify the burglar soon.

26
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:37,560
Aha!

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,000
What's this?

28
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,719
A strand of golden hair.

29
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,019
This is a very important piece of trace evidence, McGraw.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,620
It tells me the suspect has long golden hair, and very few men have long golden hair.

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,859
So our criminal could be a woman.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,319
A woman?

33
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,840
Was she working alone?

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,879
Did she have an accomplice?

35
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,439
An accomplice?

36
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:58,859
No.

37
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,659
No, McGraw.

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,319
She was definitely working alone.

39
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,780
See here, there are footprints in the porridge.

40
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,040
Here on the floor, small footprints.

41
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:10,620
This tells me that our suspect is small, and could possibly be a child.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,460
A child?

43
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,219
Surely not, sir.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,759
We must follow the clues, McGraw.

45
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,319
The evidence doesn't lie.

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,300
Now, let's reconstruct the crime.

47
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,740
The suspect came in, sat in each chair, breaking the smallest one into little pieces.

48
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:32,039
Next, the porridge, she obviously tried to eat it, and because it was so hot, she dropped it on the floor.

49
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,199
Making this mess, hmm, interesting.

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,099
These footprints seem to lead upstairs.

51
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,699
McGraw, did your officers clear the scene?

52
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:46,159
Well, there was no one down here, and maybe we forgot to check upstairs.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,319
Hey, what's with all the noise?

54
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,719
I'm trying to sleep up here.

55
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,979
There she is!

56
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,699
Get her!

57
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:52,740
Argh!

58
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,240
All right, we're back.

59
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,319
So, a lot of interesting phrases there.

60
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,139
They are obviously investigating a break-in.

61
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,719
Okay, a break-in, yeah.

62
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:13,379
So someone broke into this family's house, so they have to investigate the evidence and some of the things that were left behind.

63
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:19,020
So now, why don't we take a look on Language Takeaway, some of the specific words they used.

64
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,020
All right, the first word that we have is forensics, the forensics team.

65
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,099
Forensics team.

66
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:39,099
So, a forensics team is a team at a police department or a police station that studies the things that are left behind after a crime.

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,060
All right, so that team goes and collects the evidence.

68
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,419
So you could look at hair or fingerprints or footprints, things like that.

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,319
A forensics team is kind of like a team that puts together puzzle pieces, trying to figure out what the story was.

70
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:10,800
So as you said, the TV show CSI, the whole show revolves around, follows a group of forensic scientists who go to crime scenes and look at blood and different pieces of evidence that are left behind.

71
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:11,659
Very cool.

72
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:16,240
So, one piece of evidence that a forensics team might look at is a fingerprint.

73
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,120
That's right, a fingerprint.

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,259
Or in the dialogue, we found fingerprints, the plural form.

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:31,100
Okay, so for example, if you go to a police station because the police think that you have committed a crime, the police will take your fingerprints.

76
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:41,860
That means they'll put your finger, that means they'll put your fingers into ink and they will, they will make you push your fingers onto a piece of paper to see what your fingers look like.

77
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,560
That's right.

78
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,600
So our fingerprints have a unique pattern.

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,199
Everyone has different fingerprints.

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,920
There are no two fingerprints alike in the world, right?

81
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,160
Right, so it's kind of like a form of identification.

82
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,480
Very good.

83
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:55,259
That's right.

84
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,360
So that is your fingerprint.

85
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:09,560
So moving on, we talked about fingerprints and the scientists who are investigating the crime scene and they are talking about a very important piece of trace evidence.

86
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,139
Okay, well let's look first at the second word there.

87
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,420
We've got the word evidence.

88
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:28,000
So evidence is something that is usually physical, like a piece of clothing or hair, that can be used against someone when we're trying to prove that they have committed a crime.

89
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,439
Right, so for example, a weapon or fingerprints, all that is evidence.

90
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,139
Okay, so Marco, what's the difference between evidence and trace evidence?

91
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,139
Well, as you'd notice, you have the specific word there, trace.

92
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:49,019
And to trace means to follow or to connect, right?

93
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:56,180
So what you're doing here is you're taking this evidence to follow or connect the person that committed the crime.

94
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,180
So for example, fingerprints lets you know who committed the crime.

95
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,319
Okay, or maybe if you have blood, you can find out who did this crime.

96
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,199
But what about like a broken window?

97
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:12,819
Well, that's just evidence that just lets you know how the crime was committed, maybe how they got into the house.

98
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,000
But not who did it.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,620
But not who did it.

100
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,800
Okay, so trace evidence helps you connect the crime to the person who committed the crime.

101
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:28,360
And well, moving on, we found that very important piece of trace evidence, which was a piece of or a strand of golden hair.

102
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:34,860
And the police officer said, well, this tells me that the suspect has long golden hair.

103
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,360
So a suspect.

104
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,339
Okay, this word is it looks exactly the same as the word to suspect.

105
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,740
But be careful because we say these two words in different ways.

106
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,540
So to suspect, that's a verb.

107
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,040
That's right.

108
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,519
So I suspect Marco did it.

109
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,680
So that means I think or I imagine.

110
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,379
Right.

111
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,899
Whereas a suspect, a noun, a suspect is a person.

112
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:04,839
So the person who we think or the person who the police think committed a crime.

113
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,360
Okay.

114
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:10,519
So for example, we're talking about some trace evidence like long blonde hair.

115
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:16,000
That means the suspect is probably a woman and is probably blonde.

116
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,060
Very good.

117
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,120
And it's interesting that you use the verb to suspect and a suspect all because you're not sure yet.

118
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,040
So this person may have committed the crime or may not.

119
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:27,779
That's right.

120
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,620
So we have to wait until the trial.

121
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:35,759
We have to wait until we prove this person is guilty before we can say that they actually committed the crime.

122
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,540
Very good.

123
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,360
Okay.

124
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:45,879
And well, you have a suspect and usually you also have somebody who is an accomplice to the crime or to the suspect.

125
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:46,439
Okay.

126
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,759
So a suspect, as we said, is a person.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,480
It's a noun.

128
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,019
So is an accomplice.

129
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,060
So accomplice is a suspect's helper.

130
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,019
Right.

131
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:04,480
So basically, if you're robbing a bank and I wait outside in the car while you're robbing the bank, then I am an accomplice.

132
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:04,920
That's right.

133
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:09,000
And under most laws, you could be sentenced to jail.

134
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,480
So the accomplice usually doesn't commit the crime.

135
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,519
You robbed the bank, but I just waited outside in the car to drive you out.

136
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,199
So I didn't rob the bank.

137
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,360
But sometimes accomplices do also have guns and shoot people or knives.

138
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,920
So an accomplice is basically just the helper of the criminal, but they can get in trouble, too.

139
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,240
Right.

140
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:34,299
So basically, it's a person that helps out and knows about the crime, but didn't tell the police about it.

141
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:34,740
Exactly.

142
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,940
That's a really important aspect.

143
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,399
Okay.

144
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,500
So a lot of interesting words there all related to crimes.

145
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,799
Why don't we move on now to a couple of different phrases that we have prepared for you on Fluency Builder.

146
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,600
Fluency Builder.

147
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,539
Okay.

148
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:53,879
I like this first phrase.

149
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,639
It's a phrase you might hear a lot, actually, in police shows.

150
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,620
Give it to me straight.

151
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:00,559
Give it to me straight.

152
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:06,039
Actually, also, you can use it when you're just talking to someone and they're, like, hesitant, right?

153
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,399
Like, I don't know how to tell you this, but...

154
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,240
I'm not so sure.

155
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,840
I don't think you're going to like what I have to say.

156
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,899
So I can just say, okay, come on, just give it to me straight.

157
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,559
Okay.

158
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,240
I don't like your shirt.

159
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,480
No, I'm just kidding.

160
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,299
It's a nice shirt.

161
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,059
But what you're basically asking for is the person to say, be honest with me.

162
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,759
Be direct.

163
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,639
Be direct.

164
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,360
Straight can mean both of those things.

165
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,840
Honest or straightforward or quick.

166
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,519
You don't want someone to go around and around and say lots of different things.

167
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,200
So I guess, yeah, that does make sense.

168
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,720
Give it to me straight maybe comes from straightforward.

169
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:45,720
So to be straightforward is to not hesitate to just say something directly and honestly.

170
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,179
Exactly.

171
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:46,799
Okay.

172
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:56,200
So moving on to our next phrase, McGraw is talking about the bowls and he said, well, they are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak.

173
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,559
As we speak.

174
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,559
Okay, so this is actually a phrase that refers to time.

175
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,759
So in this instance, what he's basically saying is right now.

176
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,759
They're being analyzed right now or in this moment.

177
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,879
So it's a way of indicating that something is happening at this very moment.

178
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,379
Exactly.

179
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:19,899
So I could say, did you know that the president is giving a speech as we speak?

180
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,639
Okay, so that means the president is talking right now.

181
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:24,139
Exactly.

182
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:24,940
As we speak.

183
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,799
Okay, very good phrase.

184
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,960
Now moving on to our third phrase, Detective McGee was talking about reconstructing the crime.

185
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,279
He said, let's reconstruct the crime.

186
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:42,399
Okay, so I don't know if any of you watch these crime TV shows like Dexter or CSI.

187
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,200
This is my favorite part because they tell you exactly what they believe happened.

188
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,840
So to reconstruct means to build again or to recreate, to create again.

189
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,360
So basically they start at the beginning and they pretend to follow what happened during the crime.

190
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:08,980
So that's basically the verb, to reconstruct, to rebuild, recreate, reconstruct the crime.

191
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,159
Very good.

192
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,100
And what about our last phrase?

193
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,299
Okay, so our last phrase is again a very typical police phrase.

194
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,039
You hear this a lot when there's been a crime or on TV when they're talking about the scene of the crime.

195
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:30,539
That means the place where the crime happened and the police say we need to clear the scene or did the officers clear the scene?

196
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,700
So to clear means to empty out.

197
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:39,159
Right, but they're not talking about emptying out the evidence or removing everything from the house.

198
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,899
They're just saying to remove people, right?

199
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,340
Right.

200
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,159
Or obstructions.

201
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,659
Exactly.

202
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,179
And why is it that a police officer would want to make all the people go away?

203
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,039
Well, because you don't want people stepping on the evidence or maybe putting their fingerprints all over the place.

204
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:02,480
Right, so it's very important that the officers, the police officers clear the scene so that they can start their investigation.

205
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,000
Right.

206
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:03,980
Very good.

207
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,600
A lot of interesting phrases there.

208
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,080
I think we should go back.

209
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:15,179
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this really interesting topic.

210
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,500
Alright Officer McGraw, give it to me straight.

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What are we looking at here?

212
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:28,440
Detective McGee.

213
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:29,419
Glad to see you.

214
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,080
We could sure use your expertise on this one.

215
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,120
It's a break in, but nothing seems to have been stolen.

216
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:38,899
We received a call from the Baer family at around 1030 this morning.

217
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:42,899
They had gone out for a walk before breakfast and came home to this mess.

218
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,320
Broken chairs and porridge all over the place.

219
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,779
Apparently Mama Baer had made the porridge a little too hot, you see, and they were waiting for it to cool down.

220
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:54,980
Okay then, let's start examining the evidence.

221
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,159
Have the forensics team been in yet?

222
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,919
Yes sir.

223
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,980
They found some fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak.

224
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,379
Hopefully they will be able to identify the burglar soon.

225
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,000
Aha!

226
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:12,440
What's this?

227
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,139
A strand of golden hair.

228
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,460
This is a very important piece of trace evidence, McGraw.

229
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,059
It tells me the suspect has long golden hair, and very few men have long golden hair.

230
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,299
So our criminal could be a woman.

231
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:26,759
A woman?

232
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:28,259
Was she working alone?

233
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:30,320
Did she have an accomplice?

234
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:31,879
An accomplice?

235
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:32,299
No.

236
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,100
No, McGraw.

237
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,759
She was definitely working alone.

238
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,220
See here, there are footprints in the porridge.

239
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,480
Here on the floor, small footprints.

240
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:44,059
This tells me that our suspect is small, and could possibly be a child.

241
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:45,899
A child?

242
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,659
Surely not, sir.

243
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,200
We must follow the clues, McGraw.

244
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:51,759
The evidence doesn't lie.

245
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,759
Now, let's reconstruct the crime.

246
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,179
The suspect came in, sat in each chair, breaking the smallest one into little pieces.

247
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,480
Next, the porridge, she obviously tried to eat it, and because it was so hot, she dropped it on the floor.

248
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,639
Making this mess, hmm, interesting.

249
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,519
These footprints seem to lead upstairs.

250
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,139
McGraw, did your officers clear the scene?

251
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,600
Well, there was no one down here, and maybe we forgot to check upstairs.

252
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,759
Hey, what's with all the noise?

253
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,159
I'm trying to sleep up here.

254
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,379
There she is.

255
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,220
Get her.

256
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:37,379
So, you mentioned a couple of different shows, such as Dexter and CSI.

257
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,799
Do you watch any of these shows?

258
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,379
I do.

259
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,500
I'm a big fan of Dexter.

260
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,019
Dexter.

261
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,320
And Dexter, as you know, works at a police station in Miami, and his character is in Forensics.

262
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:49,840
He analyzes blood.

263
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:50,299
Right.

264
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,419
He's like a blood expert.

265
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:51,820
Yes.

266
00:14:51,820 --> 00:15:00,179
But it's interesting because he commits crimes himself, so he uses his knowledge to help him to not get caught.

267
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,740
Right, so he's both a criminal and he's a police officer.

268
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,659
But he's kind of like a superhero criminal, right?

269
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:10,279
Because he doesn't kill for fun or pleasure, he just takes out people who kind of deserve it, right?

270
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,559
Yes, but he does kind of do it for pleasure because he's obsessed.

271
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,440
He can't not kill.

272
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,580
So, instead of killing good people, he decides he will only ever kill bad people.

273
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,440
It's a really good show.

274
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,039
I've watched a couple of episodes and it's very, very good.

275
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,179
The same as CSI.

276
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,299
There are a couple of different versions.

277
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,440
There's CSI Miami, New York, and Las Vegas, but my favorite is Las Vegas.

278
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,360
Very, very good.

279
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,580
And also Law and Order.

280
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,960
I've watched a couple of episodes of Law and Order.

281
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:39,460
It's pretty good.

282
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,659
Yeah, they often talk about Forensics because they have both parts.

283
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,620
They have the police part and the law part with the lawyers who have to use the evidence in court.

284
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:48,759
Very interesting.

285
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:57,539
And there's also, well, forensic scientists, they take a look at the evidence, but I think also they examine the body back at the morgue, right?

286
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,059
That's right.

287
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,179
They look at the body to find out what happened to the body.

288
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,639
This is all a part of reconstructing the crime.

289
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:06,559
So this person is also sometimes called a coroner, right?

290
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,759
Okay, the person who analyzes the body.

291
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:15,279
It's pretty scary though, if you think about having to, you know, to analyze a body after, I don't know.

292
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,659
You have to, I think you have to be very experienced as a doctor.

293
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,559
It's a very interesting, I don't know, I don't even know how somebody becomes a forensic scientist, for example.

294
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh, you can go to school for it.

295
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,740
Yeah, they have lots of forensic programs.

296
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:36,639
I think I saw on Discovery Channel, they have a reality TV show about, you know, students, forensic students, and they're actually taken to real crime scenes and then they get eliminated one by one.

297
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll have to look it up.

298
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,419
Well, I'm curious to know, have you ever heard of this before, forensic science or forensic anthropology?

299
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,759
There are lots of people who study this and who do this as a job.

300
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:54,220
And if you're not interested in that, maybe you could tell us about what kind of crime drama TV shows you like because we certainly love them here.

301
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,980
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

302
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:56,860
All right.

303
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,539
We'll see everyone there.

304
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:57,899
Bye.
