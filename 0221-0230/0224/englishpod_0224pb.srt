00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you guys today.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This one is all about a crime scene.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So we are going to be at a crime scene.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We are with the police officers, and we're going to take a look at some very, very interesting and specific vocab to, like, police and a crime and all that.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's right.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So if you are a fan of the TV show CSI, or you like some of these investigation police work TV shows, this is a lesson for you.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So why don't we go and listen to the dialogue for the first time?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
All right, Officer McGraw, give it to me straight.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What are we looking at here?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Detective McGee.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're glad to see you.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We could sure use your expertise on this one.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's a break-in, but nothing seems to have been stolen, and we received a call from the Bear family at around 1030 this morning.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They had gone out for a walk before breakfast and came home to this mess.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Broken chairs and porridge all over the place.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Apparently Mama Bear had made the porridge a little too hot, you see, and they were waiting for it to cool down.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay then, let's start examining the evidence.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Have the forensics team been in yet?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes sir.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They found some fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hopefully they will be able to identify the burglar soon.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Aha!

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What's this?

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A strand of golden hair.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is a very important piece of trace evidence, McGraw.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It tells me the suspect has long golden hair, and very few men have long golden hair.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So our criminal could be a woman.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A woman?

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Was she working alone?

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Did she have an accomplice?

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
An accomplice?

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No, McGraw.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
She was definitely working alone.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
See here, there are footprints in the porridge.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Here on the floor, small footprints.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This tells me that our suspect is small, and could possibly be a child.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
A child?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Surely not, sir.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We must follow the clues, McGraw.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The evidence doesn't lie.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now, let's reconstruct the crime.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The suspect came in, sat in each chair, breaking the smallest one into little pieces.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Next, the porridge, she obviously tried to eat it, and because it was so hot, she dropped it on the floor.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Making this mess, hmm, interesting.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
These footprints seem to lead upstairs.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
McGraw, did your officers clear the scene?

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, there was no one down here, and maybe we forgot to check upstairs.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey, what's with all the noise?

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm trying to sleep up here.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There she is!

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Get her!

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Argh!

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
All right, we're back.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So, a lot of interesting phrases there.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
They are obviously investigating a break-in.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, a break-in, yeah.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So someone broke into this family's house, so they have to investigate the evidence and some of the things that were left behind.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So now, why don't we take a look on Language Takeaway, some of the specific words they used.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All right, the first word that we have is forensics, the forensics team.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Forensics team.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So, a forensics team is a team at a police department or a police station that studies the things that are left behind after a crime.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
All right, so that team goes and collects the evidence.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So you could look at hair or fingerprints or footprints, things like that.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A forensics team is kind of like a team that puts together puzzle pieces, trying to figure out what the story was.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So as you said, the TV show CSI, the whole show revolves around, follows a group of forensic scientists who go to crime scenes and look at blood and different pieces of evidence that are left behind.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Very cool.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So, one piece of evidence that a forensics team might look at is a fingerprint.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's right, a fingerprint.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Or in the dialogue, we found fingerprints, the plural form.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, so for example, if you go to a police station because the police think that you have committed a crime, the police will take your fingerprints.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That means they'll put your finger, that means they'll put your fingers into ink and they will, they will make you push your fingers onto a piece of paper to see what your fingers look like.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's right.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So our fingerprints have a unique pattern.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Everyone has different fingerprints.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There are no two fingerprints alike in the world, right?

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Right, so it's kind of like a form of identification.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Very good.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's right.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So that is your fingerprint.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So moving on, we talked about fingerprints and the scientists who are investigating the crime scene and they are talking about a very important piece of trace evidence.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, well let's look first at the second word there.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We've got the word evidence.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So evidence is something that is usually physical, like a piece of clothing or hair, that can be used against someone when we're trying to prove that they have committed a crime.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Right, so for example, a weapon or fingerprints, all that is evidence.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, so Marco, what's the difference between evidence and trace evidence?

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, as you'd notice, you have the specific word there, trace.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And to trace means to follow or to connect, right?

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So what you're doing here is you're taking this evidence to follow or connect the person that committed the crime.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So for example, fingerprints lets you know who committed the crime.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay, or maybe if you have blood, you can find out who did this crime.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But what about like a broken window?

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, that's just evidence that just lets you know how the crime was committed, maybe how they got into the house.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But not who did it.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But not who did it.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay, so trace evidence helps you connect the crime to the person who committed the crime.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And well, moving on, we found that very important piece of trace evidence, which was a piece of or a strand of golden hair.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And the police officer said, well, this tells me that the suspect has long golden hair.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So a suspect.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, this word is it looks exactly the same as the word to suspect.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But be careful because we say these two words in different ways.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So to suspect, that's a verb.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's right.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So I suspect Marco did it.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So that means I think or I imagine.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Right.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Whereas a suspect, a noun, a suspect is a person.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So the person who we think or the person who the police think committed a crime.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So for example, we're talking about some trace evidence like long blonde hair.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That means the suspect is probably a woman and is probably blonde.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Very good.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And it's interesting that you use the verb to suspect and a suspect all because you're not sure yet.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So this person may have committed the crime or may not.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So we have to wait until the trial.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We have to wait until we prove this person is guilty before we can say that they actually committed the crime.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Very good.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And well, you have a suspect and usually you also have somebody who is an accomplice to the crime or to the suspect.

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So a suspect, as we said, is a person.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's a noun.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So is an accomplice.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So accomplice is a suspect's helper.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Right.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So basically, if you're robbing a bank and I wait outside in the car while you're robbing the bank, then I am an accomplice.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's right.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And under most laws, you could be sentenced to jail.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So the accomplice usually doesn't commit the crime.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You robbed the bank, but I just waited outside in the car to drive you out.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So I didn't rob the bank.

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But sometimes accomplices do also have guns and shoot people or knives.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So an accomplice is basically just the helper of the criminal, but they can get in trouble, too.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So basically, it's a person that helps out and knows about the crime, but didn't tell the police about it.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Exactly.

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's a really important aspect.

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So a lot of interesting words there all related to crimes.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why don't we move on now to a couple of different phrases that we have prepared for you on Fluency Builder.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Fluency Builder.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I like this first phrase.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's a phrase you might hear a lot, actually, in police shows.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Give it to me straight.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Give it to me straight.

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Actually, also, you can use it when you're just talking to someone and they're, like, hesitant, right?

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Like, I don't know how to tell you this, but...

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm not so sure.

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't think you're going to like what I have to say.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So I can just say, okay, come on, just give it to me straight.

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't like your shirt.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, I'm just kidding.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's a nice shirt.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But what you're basically asking for is the person to say, be honest with me.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Be direct.

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Be direct.

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Straight can mean both of those things.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Honest or straightforward or quick.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You don't want someone to go around and around and say lots of different things.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So I guess, yeah, that does make sense.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Give it to me straight maybe comes from straightforward.

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So to be straightforward is to not hesitate to just say something directly and honestly.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Exactly.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So moving on to our next phrase, McGraw is talking about the bowls and he said, well, they are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak.

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
As we speak.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay, so this is actually a phrase that refers to time.

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So in this instance, what he's basically saying is right now.

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They're being analyzed right now or in this moment.

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So it's a way of indicating that something is happening at this very moment.

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Exactly.

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So I could say, did you know that the president is giving a speech as we speak?

180
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay, so that means the president is talking right now.

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Exactly.

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
As we speak.

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay, very good phrase.

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Now moving on to our third phrase, Detective McGee was talking about reconstructing the crime.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He said, let's reconstruct the crime.

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay, so I don't know if any of you watch these crime TV shows like Dexter or CSI.

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is my favorite part because they tell you exactly what they believe happened.

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So to reconstruct means to build again or to recreate, to create again.

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So basically they start at the beginning and they pretend to follow what happened during the crime.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So that's basically the verb, to reconstruct, to rebuild, recreate, reconstruct the crime.

191
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Very good.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And what about our last phrase?

193
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay, so our last phrase is again a very typical police phrase.

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You hear this a lot when there's been a crime or on TV when they're talking about the scene of the crime.

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That means the place where the crime happened and the police say we need to clear the scene or did the officers clear the scene?

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So to clear means to empty out.

197
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Right, but they're not talking about emptying out the evidence or removing everything from the house.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They're just saying to remove people, right?

199
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Right.

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Or obstructions.

201
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Exactly.

202
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And why is it that a police officer would want to make all the people go away?

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, because you don't want people stepping on the evidence or maybe putting their fingerprints all over the place.

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Right, so it's very important that the officers, the police officers clear the scene so that they can start their investigation.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Right.

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Very good.

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
A lot of interesting phrases there.

208
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I think we should go back.

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this really interesting topic.

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Alright Officer McGraw, give it to me straight.

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What are we looking at here?

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Detective McGee.

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Glad to see you.

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We could sure use your expertise on this one.

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's a break in, but nothing seems to have been stolen.

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We received a call from the Baer family at around 1030 this morning.

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They had gone out for a walk before breakfast and came home to this mess.

218
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Broken chairs and porridge all over the place.

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Apparently Mama Baer had made the porridge a little too hot, you see, and they were waiting for it to cool down.

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay then, let's start examining the evidence.

221
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Have the forensics team been in yet?

222
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yes sir.

223
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
They found some fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak.

224
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hopefully they will be able to identify the burglar soon.

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Aha!

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What's this?

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
A strand of golden hair.

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This is a very important piece of trace evidence, McGraw.

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It tells me the suspect has long golden hair, and very few men have long golden hair.

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So our criminal could be a woman.

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,000
A woman?

232
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Was she working alone?

233
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Did she have an accomplice?

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,000
An accomplice?

235
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No.

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No, McGraw.

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
She was definitely working alone.

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
See here, there are footprints in the porridge.

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Here on the floor, small footprints.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This tells me that our suspect is small, and could possibly be a child.

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,000
A child?

242
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Surely not, sir.

243
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We must follow the clues, McGraw.

244
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The evidence doesn't lie.

245
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Now, let's reconstruct the crime.

246
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The suspect came in, sat in each chair, breaking the smallest one into little pieces.

247
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Next, the porridge, she obviously tried to eat it, and because it was so hot, she dropped it on the floor.

248
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Making this mess, hmm, interesting.

249
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
These footprints seem to lead upstairs.

250
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
McGraw, did your officers clear the scene?

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, there was no one down here, and maybe we forgot to check upstairs.

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Hey, what's with all the noise?

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm trying to sleep up here.

254
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
There she is.

255
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Get her.

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So, you mentioned a couple of different shows, such as Dexter and CSI.

257
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Do you watch any of these shows?

258
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I do.

259
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm a big fan of Dexter.

260
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Dexter.

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And Dexter, as you know, works at a police station in Miami, and his character is in Forensics.

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He analyzes blood.

263
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Right.

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He's like a blood expert.

265
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes.

266
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But it's interesting because he commits crimes himself, so he uses his knowledge to help him to not get caught.

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Right, so he's both a criminal and he's a police officer.

268
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But he's kind of like a superhero criminal, right?

269
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Because he doesn't kill for fun or pleasure, he just takes out people who kind of deserve it, right?

270
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes, but he does kind of do it for pleasure because he's obsessed.

271
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He can't not kill.

272
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So, instead of killing good people, he decides he will only ever kill bad people.

273
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's a really good show.

274
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I've watched a couple of episodes and it's very, very good.

275
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The same as CSI.

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There are a couple of different versions.

277
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There's CSI Miami, New York, and Las Vegas, but my favorite is Las Vegas.

278
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Very, very good.

279
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And also Law and Order.

280
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I've watched a couple of episodes of Law and Order.

281
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's pretty good.

282
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah, they often talk about Forensics because they have both parts.

283
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
They have the police part and the law part with the lawyers who have to use the evidence in court.

284
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Very interesting.

285
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And there's also, well, forensic scientists, they take a look at the evidence, but I think also they examine the body back at the morgue, right?

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's right.

287
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
They look at the body to find out what happened to the body.

288
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This is all a part of reconstructing the crime.

289
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So this person is also sometimes called a coroner, right?

290
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Okay, the person who analyzes the body.

291
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's pretty scary though, if you think about having to, you know, to analyze a body after, I don't know.

292
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You have to, I think you have to be very experienced as a doctor.

293
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's a very interesting, I don't know, I don't even know how somebody becomes a forensic scientist, for example.

294
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh, you can go to school for it.

295
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah, they have lots of forensic programs.

296
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I think I saw on Discovery Channel, they have a reality TV show about, you know, students, forensic students, and they're actually taken to real crime scenes and then they get eliminated one by one.

297
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll have to look it up.

298
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Well, I'm curious to know, have you ever heard of this before, forensic science or forensic anthropology?

299
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There are lots of people who study this and who do this as a job.

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And if you're not interested in that, maybe you could tell us about what kind of crime drama TV shows you like because we certainly love them here.

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,000
All right.

303
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
We'll see everyone there.

304
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Bye.
