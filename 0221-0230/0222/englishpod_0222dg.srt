1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, what's your guys' take on all this global warming hysteria in the media?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's pretty serious, man.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There have been tons of scientific studies and the scientific community says that the Earth is heating up.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We need to make some drastic changes to our lifestyle if we want to preserve our planet.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't know.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo if you ask me.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, I don't really know if I believe in global warming either or whether or not it was our doing or natural change the Earth is going through.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But you have to admit that we're living pretty irresponsibly here in the West.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I guess.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I think the issue at hand is sustainability.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We've only got this one Earth we can live on and our resources are quickly disappearing because of our own carelessness and our inability to think of anyone but ourselves and anything but the present.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So like I was saying, we need to change the way we live.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We need to reduce our carbon footprint.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But it doesn't have to be that drastic.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too expensive to be feasible right now and we don't have to be hippies living off the land and buying everything organic either, though it helps.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I carpool to work every day with some buddies of mine.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I have a rain barrel outside my house I used to water my plants and my lawn in the summer and I make sure I always bring reusable bags with me when I get my groceries.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And we just started using biodegradable plastic made from corn oil for takeout orders at my family's restaurant.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Remember the three R's?

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Reduce, reuse, recycle.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Exactly.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's just small simple changes.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Like buying energy-saving light bulbs, starting a compost bin, recycling bottles and papers, using reusable water bottles, stop using disposable cups and cutlery.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Like the ones we're drinking out of?

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah.
