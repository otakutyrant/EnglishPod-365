00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and today's lesson is an advanced level lesson.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That means we'll be speaking using our normal English tone of voice and using some very, very difficult vocabulary and phrases.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So this is really good practice for all of you out there.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're going to change a little bit the dynamic of how it works.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We're not going to look specifically at language takeaway or Fluency Builder.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're going to talk about the topic.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are going to pick out a couple of different words and phrases that are used in the dialogue, but we're mainly going to talk, just have a conversation, and you can just listen and study a little bit of what we're saying.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So what is the topic today, Marco?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, today we're going to talk about the environment, specifically about our carbon footprint.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, that is the title of today's lesson.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I encourage all of you to listen to the context of that phrase, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what it and some of these other phrases mean.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So what's your guys' take on all this global warming hysteria in the media?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's pretty serious, man.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There have been tons of scientific studies, and the scientific community says that the Earth is heating up.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We need to make some drastic changes to our lifestyle if we want to preserve our planet.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It sounds like a bunch of mumble jumble if you ask me.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The Earth will save itself.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It survived worst disasters in the past.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There is no way anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to work, especially in the winter, and we have no bus system.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My house is 40 years old, and it would take a lot of money to get it refitted to be green and energy efficient.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, I don't really know if I believe in global warming either or whether or not it was our doing or natural change the Earth is going through, but you have to admit that we're living pretty irresponsibly here in the West.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I guess.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think the issue at hand is sustainability.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We've only got this one Earth we can live on, and our resources are quickly disappearing because of our own carelessness and our inability to think of anyone but ourselves and anything but the present.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So like I was saying, we need to change the way we live.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We need to reduce our carbon footprint.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But it doesn't have to be that drastic.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too expensive to be feasible right now, and we don't have to be hippies living off the land and buying everything organic either, though it helps.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I carpool to work every day with some buddies of mine.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I have a rain barrel outside my house I used to water my plants and my lawn in the summer, and I make sure I always bring reusable bags with me when I get my groceries.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And we just started using biodegradable plastic made from corn oil for take-out orders at my family's restaurant.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Remember the three R's?

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Reduce, reuse, recycle.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Exactly.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's just small, simple changes.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Like buying energy-saving light bulbs.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Starting a compost bin.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Recycling bottles and papers.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Using reusable water bottles.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Stop using disposable cups and cutlery.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Like the ones we're drinking out of?

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
All right, we're back.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So as you probably guessed, carbon footprint, it's pretty easy.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're talking about a footprint is the evidence you leave if you're walking on sand, for example.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Exactly.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And if we talk about carbon, we're talking about the element, right?

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Carbon.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yep.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So carbon is something that is in everything, basically.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's organic.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But it can also, in the case of a carbon footprint, mean the amount of maybe waste or damage that we do to the earth or to the environment.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Right.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So for example, you're driving your car.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We all know that the gas that is emitted from the exhaust pipe is CO2, right?

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And that contains carbon.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So that's a way of seeing that you're leaving a footprint of carbon.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You are damaging the atmosphere a little bit by driving your car.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So in talking about a carbon footprint, we talk about having a low carbon footprint, which is good, or a very high carbon footprint, which is bad.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Right.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So there were a lot of interesting things coming up in the dialogue.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
One of the first things was?

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well the first thing that they're talking about in this dialogue is they're having kind of an argument about whether or not global warming and global climate change really exists.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, this is a very interesting part because some people say, well, global warming is happening, global warming is real.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And other people say, well, it's not real.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's not really a problem.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is just a phase that the earth will go through and like everything, it'll disappear.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, I agree with people who say that the earth goes through phases because sometimes there are centuries that are hotter and sometimes there are centuries that are colder.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But I think it's undeniable that there has been a large and immediate global climate change in the last maybe 20 years.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, we're definitely speeding up maybe that cycle, right?

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Exactly.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And I think what's great evidence of this and terrible evidence of this is the three earthquakes, massive earthquakes that have happened in the last couple of months.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I think that earthquakes like last year and like this year are really, really important reminders that we do as humans influence the way that the world responds to us.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think I always see it as the earth kind of just shaking its back, kind of saying, like, get off me, you know, stop it.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That itches.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah, exactly.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I think that that's kind of the way I see earthquakes sometimes.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But when they were talking about, well, is it real?

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Is it not?

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
They use a really interesting phrase and says, it sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Mumbo jumbo.

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So this is a way to say it sounds like a bunch of garbage or it sounds like a bunch of gibberish.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It sounds like a bunch of people are talking about something that doesn't really exist.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So mumbo jumbo is basically something that's not really real or true.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I think, don't you also, can you use it as somebody that's saying something that you don't really understand?

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Right.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So if maybe I'm talking to you about something that's very academic and very scholarly, you say, sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo to me.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Exactly.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So that's what the person said.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You know, the environmental problems are a bunch of mumbo jumbo.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But it was really interesting because they were like, well, we have to save the earth and well, and then there was actually a phrase here that was really kind of hard for me to understand when the person said, I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Boonies.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So what does it mean by living in the boonies?

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is a very common word to hear in spoken English, especially with young people.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Boonies means we live far away from civilization.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We live far away from cities.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We live far away from everything.

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So maybe these people live in the countryside or in a small village and they don't feel like they're affected by what people in the big cities do.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
OK, so if you say, oh, I live in the boonies, you're just saying I live really far, really far away.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So this is a very common American word.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I think you can also say boondocks, which is like that movie Boondock Saints.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But boondocks and boonies means very far away.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So I could say, Marco, I'm not going to drive out to your house for a party.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You live in the boonies.

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Do you have any other ways that you can say that you live really far away?

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You live in Egypt, you live in Egypt, which for us in America is obviously very, very far away.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sometimes we say Yanks.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, the Yanks.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Exactly.

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yanks.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
People in New Zealand say that.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I've also heard people say, oh, you live where the wind turns around.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Really?

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, I like that.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You live so far.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, God, you live where the wind turns around the end of the earth.

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Exactly.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Wow.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So, well, there are a lot of different ways of saying that.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So they were talking about different aspects of the environment, like that we heard the word green or energy efficient.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
OK, so basically what they're doing is they're talking about some of the things they've heard in the media, maybe or on TV, about what people are supposed to be doing.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You know, these are very abstract.

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That means these are very kind of big terms.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Go green or be more energy efficient.

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah, I've heard this, like, for example, when people say, oh, you have to be more green or go green.

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That means more friendly towards the ecosystem.

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Right.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's right.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So this is a general suggestion, and we can talk about specifics in a minute, but this is a very general suggestion for thinking about the environment and doing things to help it.

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And so go green or be green is a way to be more environmentally friendly.

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We also have using energy efficient computers or light bulbs or TVs.

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Right.

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And the third thing that they talk about, and this is something that comes up a lot, is sustainability.

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, that's a big word that a lot of people like to use in this type of topic, sustainability.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Right.

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So sustainability comes from the word to sustain.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That means to hold out over time or to continue.

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So you think about something.

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Maybe sustainability is, I think, in many cases about doing or having habits, doing things that you can continue to do for a long time.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
For example, driving a big SUV to work every day is not keeping in mind sustainability because one day there will be no oil.

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So then that's not a sustainable action.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Sustainable actions mean that we have less negative impact on the world.

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Right.

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So basically what you're trying to do is to sustain, which means to hold, to withstand these habits, for example.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So when you talk about a sustainable ecosystem, it means that it has everything it needs and it can continue to work for a very, very long time.

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Right.

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So you can also talk about sustainable developments, which we talk about in aid and giving aid to other countries.

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So sustainable development is trying to help other countries or other people in ways that they can continue to do for a long time.

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's also very popular with tourism.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They talk about sustainable tourism.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Right.

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That means thinking about the environment and having tourism that can last forever, not tourism that will destroy the environment because it's very harmful.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's a very interesting topic.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And as you say, it's used in a wide range of cases, sustainable development, sustainable projects, sustainable tourism.

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There are a lot of different ways that people use this, but it's basically the same thing.

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Right.

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's in essence, it refers to that.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Keeping something going over time.

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But I think the big question here is, if you want to go green, if you want to be environmentally friendly, what do you do?

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Because it's not about big ideas.

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's about specifics.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's about changing your everyday actions.

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Right.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So these guys had a couple of ideas.

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They came up with something like, for example, hybrid vehicles, which is a big thing now.

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Basically, hybrid means two.

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Right.

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's a combination of two or more.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's right.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So, you know, the Sphinx in Egypt, that's a hybrid.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Right.

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Between a man and a lion.

180
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Exactly.

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Right.

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So a hybrid vehicle basically uses gasoline, but also electricity.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So they're very, they're very, actually very, very efficient because...

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And they're quiet.

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
They're quiet.

186
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And usually where you use up most of your gasoline is in traffic because your car is on, you're accelerating, you're braking, you're accelerating, you're braking.

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So in this case, I think hybrid vehicles run on the electric engine until they hit, I think it's 30 miles per hour.

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah.

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And once you surpass that, then it switches to the gas engine, which obviously if you have a constant high speed, it uses, it's more efficient, the combustion of the gasoline.

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Exactly.

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So a good example of a hybrid vehicle is the Toyota Prius.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Right.

193
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I think it was like the first one commercially available.

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But now they have all kinds and they're actually trying to make entirely electric cars.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So lots of things to watch out for there.

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But they also talked about something for the house.

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Right.

198
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So if you want to not just have a nice car that is environmentally friendly, but also to do things with your house, what can you put on your roof?

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I think we've seen a lot of these.

200
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
These are called solar panels.

201
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay.

202
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Solar has to do with the sun.

203
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So solar power, solar panel.

204
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That means energy that comes from the sun.

205
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So the sun and a panel is like a pad or like a, um, some kind of device that can take the energy from the sun.

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's really, really good.

208
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Basically, you know, in, um, in some places you have anywhere between eight to 12 hours of sunlight.

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So the whole day these panels are absorbing energy.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You can store them maybe in batteries and then just use them later.

211
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So basically you don't really need to use electricity that comes from coal or from nuclear power plants because, you know, you want to turn on a light.

212
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It doesn't really use up a lot of electricity and there's no waste and there's no waste.

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's all clean.

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So my question for you, does Ecuador have a lot of solar panels everywhere because you guys have so much sunlight down there.

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We don't really have a lot of them.

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's not a big commercial thing yet, but there are a lot of projects going around to help implement these things a lot better.

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,000
For example, taking these technologies to the countryside where people don't have access to electricity by means of cables, right?

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So they're implementing that.

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They're getting them to use it.

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And, but it's still expensive.

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's the problem with solar panels is that of course it's an energy efficient way of going.

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It'll save you money in the long run, but upfront upfront you got to spend a lot of money.

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, here's a good way to use sustaining.

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If someone in the countryside has solar panels in their house, it's a self-sustaining way to produce energy.

225
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You don't have to depend on another place.

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Exactly.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, actually, um, this is a very popular thing in many developed countries.

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I remember when I was living in Chile, big buildings were being marketed as energy efficient and green, um, by showing that they can be self-sustaining.

229
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So basically they would have solar panels on the roof.

230
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They would collect sunlight all day and then they had big batteries that would store this energy and then you can use it.

231
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Um, they were more efficient into keeping heat or keeping the cold.

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And also what we saw in the vocab that they also had was a rain barrels.

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So basically collecting water from the rain and then they can use this water obviously through a filtering system in order to be able to drink it or to wash your clothes and stuff.

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But basically, they would say that it could reduce your carbon footprint by more than 50% and also the amount of money you would spend because you wouldn't spend so much money on water.

235
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You wouldn't spend so much money on electricity or gas and things like this.

236
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's awesome.

237
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Well, one of the biggest concerns as far as environmental, environmentalism is water.

238
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Um, where water will come from in 50 years because there is a limited amount of fresh water in the world.

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes.

240
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And if we can reuse rain water and collect it, I think it's brilliant.

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So a barrel basically is, is like a big container, uh, circular.

242
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's like a circle and it stands up on the ground or on a roof.

243
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And it's brilliant because if you have a rain barrel that collects all this rain and you have solar panels, basically you don't need gas or electricity to take a warm shower.

244
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You just have the solar panels that can heat up the rain barrel water and there you have a warm water.

245
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You have a warm shower.

246
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It sounds so nice.

247
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You have sun kissed warmth and you have like fresh rain water.

248
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah.

249
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Uh, but the whole water issue is a very popular topic.

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I recommend that any of our listeners read, there's a very interesting article that talks about don't worry about petroleum running out in 50 years.

251
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We're droughts and huge famine in places like India, like in the middle East, in, uh, even in places of China.

252
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Really?

253
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah.

254
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Well, not so scary anyone, but, but, but yeah, it's, it's interesting reading though.

255
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah.

256
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's really good.

257
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Very serious stuff.

258
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Well, the last thing that I think we should talk about before we listen to today's audio file again is, uh, the compost bin.

259
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Now, this is maybe something that's hard to understand for someone who's never seen one before.

260
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah.

261
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But basically compost is, um, well, the verb is compost to compost, but it's also a noun.

262
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But a lot of people, they don't want to throw away their food and their, you know, organic material, things like flowers and food and, um, biodegradable things.

263
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
They actually reuse them.

264
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So basically they have a space in the backyard of the house where they throw away all the old food.

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah.

266
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Nothing plastic, nothing non biodegradable.

267
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And, um, that over time turns into fertilizer or, or mulch for their gardens.

268
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah.

269
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So basically you're, you're putting it back into the earth.

270
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah.

271
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No, this is, this is a very good option.

272
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And I remember seeing that even in Brazil, they have huge compost, uh, bins or compost places that, um, they fill up with, with this garbage and obviously things that decompose, uh, start to emit methane gas.

273
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So they've found a way to harness this gas, transported through tubes and start using it.

274
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So actually having gas stoves with this methane gas.

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's brilliant.

276
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So you can get two uses, fertilizer and methane gas.

277
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

278
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So there are a lot of options there to go green, to do your part, to help the earth.

279
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Wow.

280
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So let's listen again to the dialogue that we had today.

281
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Hopefully we've cleared up some of things that were confusing for you and we'll be back in just a moment.

282
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So what's your guys take on all this global warming hysteria in the media?

283
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's pretty serious, man.

284
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
There have been tons of scientific studies and the scientific community says that the earth is heating up.

285
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We need to make some drastic changes to our lifestyle.

286
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
If we want to preserve our planet.

287
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't know.

288
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It sounds like a bunch of mumble jumble.

289
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
If you ask me, the earth will save itself.

290
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It survived the worst disasters in the past.

291
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies.

292
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There's no way anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to work, especially in the winter.

293
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And we have no bus system.

294
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
My house is 40 years old and it would take a lot of money to get it refitted, to be green and energy efficient.

295
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Well, I don't really know if I believe in global warming either or whether or not it was our doing or a natural change the earth is going through.

296
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But you have to admit that we're living pretty irresponsibly here in the West.

297
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I guess.

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I think the issue at hand is sustainability.

299
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We've only got this one earth we can live on and our resources are quickly disappearing because of our own carelessness and our inability to think of anyone but ourselves and anything but the present.

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So like I was saying, we need to change the way we live.

301
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We need to reduce our carbon footprint.

302
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But it doesn't have to be that drastic.

303
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too expensive to be feasible right now.

304
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And we don't have to be hippies living off the land and buying everything organic either, though it helps.

305
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I carpool to work every day with some buddies of mine.

306
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I have a rain barrel outside my house.

307
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I used to water my plants and my lawn in the summer and I make sure I always bring reusable bags with me when I get my groceries.

308
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And we just started using biodegradable plastic made from corn oil for takeout orders at my family's restaurant.

309
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Remember the three R's?

310
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Reduce, reuse, recycle.

311
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Exactly.

312
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's just small simple changes like buying energy-saving light bulbs, starting a compost bin, recycling bottles and papers, using reusable water bottles, stop using disposable cups and cutlery.

313
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Like the ones we're drinking out of?

314
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yeah.

315
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
All right, we're back.

316
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So it's a very interesting topic, very debatable.

317
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
We have Earth Day coming up I think.

318
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You have to turn off your lights for an hour.

319
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
That's right, Earth Hour, Earth Day.
