00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're gonna go and buy shoes.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is very fun.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like buying shoes, although I have a hard time finding shoes in my size sometimes.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But we're here talking about men's shoes specifically.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's right.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We've actually decided to talk about this topic, buying shoes separately between men and women's shoes, because I think each type of shoe has its own type of vocab, and that can be very useful for men or women.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's right.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about the specifics of men's shoe styles.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hi, I'm looking for a pair of shoes for my son.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Sure thing.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Here we are.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you're looking for dress shoes, we have several different styles of oxford for boys.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We also carry athletic shoes, hiking boots.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, Jacob, how about these sneakers?

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Mom, they've got velcro.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, then how about these?

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What is this style called?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They're tennis shoes.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
They're very popular with teens and young adults.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, mom, can I get these?

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What are those?

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They're Chuck Taylors.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Everyone has them.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Can I please?

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't know.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Would they go with your clothes?

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The backs are really high, and the way the tongue just sticks up, they're almost like a boot, and the sole doesn't look like it would have a very good grip.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They're only $45, and they've got cool fluorescent orange shoelaces.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Mom!

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Mom!

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, try them on.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What size are your feet?

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Here's a size 9.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We'll try a size 43 on you first and see how that fits.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
A what?

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They come in European sizes.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He should be a size 43.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll be right back.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Alright, we're back.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, as you saw, we have a lot of different shoe styles, and so we're going to take a look at these on Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay, first up, we have a very popular style of shoe.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is called an athletic shoe.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, athletic shoe.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Now, I imagine that athletes wear these shoes.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Good guess, Marco.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So, athletic athletes.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is actually for sports in general.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, this is sports shoes, but in English we say athletic shoes.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay, so it's not specifically for any type of sport, but they're just comfortable shoes that you can do most sports in.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Right, like running shoes and basketball shoes and soccer shoes.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
These are all kinds of athletic shoes.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Very good.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, so these types of athletic shoes, they're usually kind of low, right?

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They don't have a lot of support around the ankle.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No, but they do have a lot of support in the heel, the bottom of your foot.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Right, because you're running, you need that extra support.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now, on the opposite, if you're going hiking, if you're maybe trekking, then you need a special type of shoe that's going to give more ankle support, and these are called hiking boots.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay, hiking boots.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So, like you were saying, you get a lot of support in your ankle, that's the back of your foot and the area around your leg, so these shoes tend to come higher on your leg.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
They're taller on your leg, and they're usually pretty heavy.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, yeah, and I think they are more weather resistant, so if it rains or if it's wet, these shoes will respond better.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're not going to get wet feet.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're not, yeah.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And so, hiking boots.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And now, we have another interesting word.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I never really understood it, why they're called this way, but we have sneakers.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Sneakers.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Sneakers.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay, I love sneakers.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I always wear sneakers.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A very common brand that you see with sneakers is Puma.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Also, Adidas.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, Converse is another brand.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Sneakers are shoes that are not fancy, they're not like leather or work shoes, but they're They're basically very simple shoes for, you know, normal daily stuff.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Just normal walking.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Young people wear them, usually.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, sneakers.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now, I never understood why they're called sneakers, because I think if you sneak, maybe on someone, I guess these shoes are good for sneaking up people.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Perhaps.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't know.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
They're less noisy than other shoes.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay, so we have sneakers, and now another type of shoe that can be a little bit confusing, they're called tennis shoes.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, tennis shoes can be considered a kind of sneaker.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Again, it's not the kind of shoe that you would normally wear to work.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's not leather, it's not a hiking boot.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They're low shoes, so low ankles, generally.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And they have, they tie up, you know.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Right.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But it's, you would think that you use these shoes to play tennis.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Not necessarily.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But not necessarily, right.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I mean, you don't have to play tennis.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, they're not specifically designed to play tennis.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No, perhaps originally they were tennis shoes for the game tennis, but nowadays they're very, very common.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They're like sneakers.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Right.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They're shoes that most young people wear to school or to play around in.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, so they're kind of a, like you say, a sneaker.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And now moving on, these might seem a little bit strange, but we call them Chuck Taylors.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Chuck Taylors.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Well, basically Chuck Taylor is a brand.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Converse.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Chuck Taylors.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We also call them Chucks.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And this is a style of shoe that this brand made very famous.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
They're very, very thin canvas shoes.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So the fabric is not leather, it's canvas.

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And they come in bright red or black or green.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Or green, yeah, yeah.

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And some of them are very low.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And some of them have an ankle, a piece of the ankle that comes up.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So it almost looks like a boot to a certain extent.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But it's not like a hiking boot.

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's not very hard.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It doesn't support your ankle as much.

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's just the style is higher.

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Exactly.

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And so because these are made of fabric, they're very thin, they're very light, they're not very good for hiking, for example.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So these are called Chuck Taylors.

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
They're very, very popular with teenagers, right?

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's right.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Teenagers all over the world wear Chuck Taylors.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And I think they're very old, this style.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
These Chuck Taylors have been around for like 30 years.

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, I think since the 1960s or 70s.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But they're still popular.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, and they haven't changed.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
They haven't changed.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Right.

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So these are the five types or styles of shoes that we're going to take a look at.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why don't we move on now to more specific vocab related to the parts of the shoe on Language Takeaway Part 2.

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Language Takeaway.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay, so Jacob is talking to his mother and his mom wants to know, hey, how about these sneakers?

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What do you think?

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And Jacob says, Mom, they've got Velcro.

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So Marco, what's this Velcro Jacob speaks of?

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, as you can see, Velcro is capitalized, right?

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And so that means this is a proper noun.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And it's actually a brand.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, it's like Chuck Taylors.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Like Chuck Taylors.

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So Velcro is supposed kind of like a zipper, right?

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
A fastener.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But instead of zipping it up, you just put two pieces of cloth together and they stick.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay, and when you pull them apart, they make that sound.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They make a loud sound.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And so sometimes with baby shoes or young children's shoes, we don't want to tie them because that's too hard.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So we have Velcro.

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is a kind of fabric, like you said, that sticks together.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We don't have to spend all this time tying things.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So you see Velcro on hats, on gloves, on jackets, on shoes.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's a very popular way to make things, close things or to keep things secure.

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
In a very easy way, right?

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You just push them together and that's it.

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
They're sealed.

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Exactly.

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So the next time you see it, now you know that it's called Velcro.

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I imagine in other languages it's probably called the same thing.

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, right.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's the brand name.

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah.

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So, okay.

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And well, now moving on to the parts of the shoe, we have the tongue.

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, well think about the body part, the tongue, right?

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
When you look at your tongue, it's straight and it's flat and it kind of curves at the bottom.

176
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Right.

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, on a shoe, when you're putting your shoe on and the front of the shoe can get stuck, you have to pull the tongue.

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's a piece of fabric or piece of the shoe where the top of your foot is.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, very good.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So that's called the tongue.

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now, some shoes have a very small tongue or a low one.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Another have a very high one.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Like for example, Chuck Taylors, they have a big tongue.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's right, very long tongue.

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And so the tongue is the part that rests on top of your foot.

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And usually the shoelaces are over the tongue.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And now moving on to the bottom part of the shoe, that's called the sole.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, S-O-L-E, sole.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is a really important part of shoes.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I always look at the sole before I buy a pair of shoes because this is the part that you use the most because you're walking on the ground.

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So for example, hiking boots, they will have a very high sole and they will have kind of like a pattern so that you don't slip if you're walking on dirt, right?

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's right.

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Sometimes rubber, a rubber sole.

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But other times like Chuck Taylors also have a rubber sole but it's very thin.

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's very thin.

196
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And some shoes, for example, they have a plastic sole maybe because they're used for other purposes so they might be a little bit slippery if you go on to a smooth surface.

197
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So the sole, that's the bottom part of the shoe.

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And the last part of the shoe that we're going to take a look at and probably the most important are the shoe laces.

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Shoe laces.

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So shoe laces are basically long pieces of string that you use to tie your shoes closed because you want your shoes to be tight on your foot.

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You don't want it to be too loose, otherwise it might fall off.

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And Chuck Taylors and some other shoes are very famous for having crazy colored laces or for people using crazy colored laces to tie them up.

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Right.

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So that's the part they use to tie or tighten the shoe with.

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So on the opposite, if a shoe doesn't have shoe laces, it's probably going to have velcro.

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's right.

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Velcro or shoe laces.

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay.

209
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So those are all the words that we have for you today.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for the last time.

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hi.

212
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm looking for a pair of shoes for my son.

213
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Sure thing.

214
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Here we are.

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you're looking for dress shoes, we have several different styles of Oxford for boys.

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We also carry athletic shoes, hiking boots.

217
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, Jacob, how about these sneakers?

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Mom, they've got velcro.

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, then how about these?

220
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What is this style called?

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They're tennis shoes.

222
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They're very popular with teens and young adults.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, Mom, can I get these?

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What are those?

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They're Chuck Taylors.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Everyone has them.

227
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Can I please?

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't know.

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Would they go with your clothes?

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The backs are really high and the way the tongue just sticks up, they're almost like a boot.

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And the sole doesn't look like it would have a very good grip.

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They're only $45.

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And they've got cool fluorescent orange shoelaces.

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Mom!

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Mom!

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay, try them on.

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What size are your feet?

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Here's a size 9.

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We'll try a size 43 on you first and see how that fits.

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
A what?

241
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
They come in European sizes.

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He should be a size 43.

243
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll be right back.

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Alright, so talking about shoes, you say that you always take a look at the sole.

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Why is this?

246
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Because I'm always afraid that my shoes are going to wear out.

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And I don't buy shoes very often.

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I love sneakers.

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I love my pumas.

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And I love flat shoes.

251
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And so when you buy a pair of shoes you really like, you don't want to buy another pair in six months.

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You want to get a pair that has a really good sole so that will last for a long time.

253
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Right, right.

254
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah, that's true.

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I think for me, yeah, that's probably one of the most important parts is the sole as long as it's comfortable.

256
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Because some soles of some shoes can be very rigid.

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So it's a little bit uncomfortable to walk with.

258
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But I don't know.

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't really have that many pairs of shoes if I think about it.

260
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, most people have one fancy pair of shoes for special occasions.

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And then a pair of work shoes that are leather.

262
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And then maybe a couple pairs of sneakers and some sandals for the summer.

263
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So you have sandals and you have flip flops.

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Or are they the same?

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, sandals is basically a kind of shoe.

266
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's an open shoe that you wear in the summer.

267
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Flip flops are a kind of sandal.

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So they usually have a V in the front and that's where you put your big toe.

269
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
In the second toe.

270
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah, so we wear them in the shower or at the beach.

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
They're usually made of plastic or rubber so that you can get them wet.

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But flip flops are a kind of sandal.

273
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, very good.

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's very interesting how many styles and types of shoes.

275
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And actually for men, I think it's not that complicated.

276
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But when we get into women's shoes, then we'll see a lot of different things.

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There are too many styles.

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I can't keep track.

279
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Alright, so that's all the time we have for today.

280
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But we'll see you guys on the website.

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If you have any questions, any doubts.

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Or if you just want to chat with us, we'll see you at EnglishPod.com.

283
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,000
See you guys there.

284
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Alright, bye.
