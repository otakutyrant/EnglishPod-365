00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:05,179
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:05,879
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,320
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,080
And today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:10,919
That's right.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,099
We're gonna go and buy shoes.

7
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:13,720
Okay.

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,439
This is very fun.

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,539
I like buying shoes, although I have a hard time finding shoes in my size sometimes.

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,500
But we're here talking about men's shoes specifically.

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,160
That's right.

12
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:35,240
We've actually decided to talk about this topic, buying shoes separately between men and women's shoes, because I think each type of shoe has its own type of vocab, and that can be very useful for men or women.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:35,740
That's right.

14
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:41,560
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about the specifics of men's shoe styles.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,539
Hi, I'm looking for a pair of shoes for my son.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,439
Sure thing.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,439
Here we are.

18
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,899
If you're looking for dress shoes, we have several different styles of oxford for boys.

19
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,679
We also carry athletic shoes, hiking boots.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,280
Oh, Jacob, how about these sneakers?

21
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,760
Mom, they've got velcro.

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,840
Well, then how about these?

23
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:10,219
What is this style called?

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,560
They're tennis shoes.

25
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,379
They're very popular with teens and young adults.

26
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,599
Oh, mom, can I get these?

27
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,060
What are those?

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,500
They're Chuck Taylors.

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,760
Everyone has them.

30
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,280
Can I please?

31
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:23,739
I don't know.

32
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:25,079
Would they go with your clothes?

33
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,319
The backs are really high, and the way the tongue just sticks up, they're almost like a boot, and the sole doesn't look like it would have a very good grip.

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,319
They're only $45, and they've got cool fluorescent orange shoelaces.

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,640
Mom!

36
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:39,719
Mom!

37
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,719
Okay, try them on.

38
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,159
What size are your feet?

39
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,480
Here's a size 9.

40
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,379
We'll try a size 43 on you first and see how that fits.

41
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:49,980
A what?

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,040
They come in European sizes.

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,859
He should be a size 43.

44
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,140
I'll be right back.

45
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,599
Alright, we're back.

46
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,199
So, as you saw, we have a lot of different shoe styles, and so we're going to take a look at these on Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:16,560
Okay, first up, we have a very popular style of shoe.

48
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,219
This is called an athletic shoe.

49
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,180
Okay, athletic shoe.

50
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,900
Now, I imagine that athletes wear these shoes.

51
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,479
Good guess, Marco.

52
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,060
So, athletic athletes.

53
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,199
This is actually for sports in general.

54
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,080
So, this is sports shoes, but in English we say athletic shoes.

55
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:40,159
Okay, so it's not specifically for any type of sport, but they're just comfortable shoes that you can do most sports in.

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,620
Right, like running shoes and basketball shoes and soccer shoes.

57
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,580
These are all kinds of athletic shoes.

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,259
Very good.

59
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:54,139
Okay, so these types of athletic shoes, they're usually kind of low, right?

60
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,419
They don't have a lot of support around the ankle.

61
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,020
No, but they do have a lot of support in the heel, the bottom of your foot.

62
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,219
Right, because you're running, you need that extra support.

63
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:13,000
Now, on the opposite, if you're going hiking, if you're maybe trekking, then you need a special type of shoe that's going to give more ankle support, and these are called hiking boots.

64
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:14,639
Okay, hiking boots.

65
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:24,439
So, like you were saying, you get a lot of support in your ankle, that's the back of your foot and the area around your leg, so these shoes tend to come higher on your leg.

66
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,460
They're taller on your leg, and they're usually pretty heavy.

67
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:37,020
Yeah, yeah, and I think they are more weather resistant, so if it rains or if it's wet, these shoes will respond better.

68
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,939
You're not going to get wet feet.

69
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:39,780
You're not, yeah.

70
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,139
And so, hiking boots.

71
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,620
And now, we have another interesting word.

72
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,319
I never really understood it, why they're called this way, but we have sneakers.

73
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,259
Sneakers.

74
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,060
Sneakers.

75
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,599
Okay, I love sneakers.

76
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,740
I always wear sneakers.

77
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:56,740
A very common brand that you see with sneakers is Puma.

78
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,360
Also, Adidas.

79
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,500
So, Converse is another brand.

80
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:17,639
Sneakers are shoes that are not fancy, they're not like leather or work shoes, but they're They're basically very simple shoes for, you know, normal daily stuff.

81
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,399
Just normal walking.

82
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,160
Young people wear them, usually.

83
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,240
Okay, sneakers.

84
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:28,319
Now, I never understood why they're called sneakers, because I think if you sneak, maybe on someone, I guess these shoes are good for sneaking up people.

85
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:28,720
Perhaps.

86
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,600
I don't know.

87
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,699
They're less noisy than other shoes.

88
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,540
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

89
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:43,019
Okay, so we have sneakers, and now another type of shoe that can be a little bit confusing, they're called tennis shoes.

90
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,740
Okay, tennis shoes can be considered a kind of sneaker.

91
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:48,500
Again, it's not the kind of shoe that you would normally wear to work.

92
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,540
It's not leather, it's not a hiking boot.

93
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,060
They're low shoes, so low ankles, generally.

94
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:57,220
And they have, they tie up, you know.

95
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,560
Right.

96
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,839
But it's, you would think that you use these shoes to play tennis.

97
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:02,959
Not necessarily.

98
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,399
But not necessarily, right.

99
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,199
I mean, you don't have to play tennis.

100
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,740
Oh, they're not specifically designed to play tennis.

101
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,279
No, perhaps originally they were tennis shoes for the game tennis, but nowadays they're very, very common.

102
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,060
They're like sneakers.

103
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:15,579
Right.

104
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,319
They're shoes that most young people wear to school or to play around in.

105
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, so they're kind of a, like you say, a sneaker.

106
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,740
And now moving on, these might seem a little bit strange, but we call them Chuck Taylors.

107
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,139
Chuck Taylors.

108
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,459
Well, basically Chuck Taylor is a brand.

109
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,120
Okay.

110
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,220
Converse.

111
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,240
Chuck Taylors.

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,620
We also call them Chucks.

113
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,899
And this is a style of shoe that this brand made very famous.

114
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,600
They're very, very thin canvas shoes.

115
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,139
So the fabric is not leather, it's canvas.

116
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:46,740
Okay.

117
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,160
And they come in bright red or black or green.

118
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:50,779
Or green, yeah, yeah.

119
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,379
And some of them are very low.

120
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,000
And some of them have an ankle, a piece of the ankle that comes up.

121
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,120
So it almost looks like a boot to a certain extent.

122
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,939
But it's not like a hiking boot.

123
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,060
It's not very hard.

124
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,379
It doesn't support your ankle as much.

125
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,879
It's just the style is higher.

126
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:08,699
Exactly.

127
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:16,000
And so because these are made of fabric, they're very thin, they're very light, they're not very good for hiking, for example.

128
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,560
So these are called Chuck Taylors.

129
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,800
They're very, very popular with teenagers, right?

130
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,079
That's right.

131
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,839
Teenagers all over the world wear Chuck Taylors.

132
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,160
And I think they're very old, this style.

133
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,860
These Chuck Taylors have been around for like 30 years.

134
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,079
Yeah, I think since the 1960s or 70s.

135
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,000
But they're still popular.

136
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,399
Yeah, and they haven't changed.

137
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,279
They haven't changed.

138
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,139
Right.

139
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,180
So these are the five types or styles of shoes that we're going to take a look at.

140
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,579
Why don't we move on now to more specific vocab related to the parts of the shoe on Language Takeaway Part 2.

141
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,199
Language Takeaway.

142
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,639
Okay, so Jacob is talking to his mother and his mom wants to know, hey, how about these sneakers?

143
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,620
What do you think?

144
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,360
And Jacob says, Mom, they've got Velcro.

145
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,819
So Marco, what's this Velcro Jacob speaks of?

146
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,160
Well, as you can see, Velcro is capitalized, right?

147
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,120
And so that means this is a proper noun.

148
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,639
And it's actually a brand.

149
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,339
Okay, it's like Chuck Taylors.

150
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,199
Like Chuck Taylors.

151
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,220
So Velcro is supposed kind of like a zipper, right?

152
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,040
A fastener.

153
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,540
But instead of zipping it up, you just put two pieces of cloth together and they stick.

154
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,379
Okay, and when you pull them apart, they make that sound.

155
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,759
They make a loud sound.

156
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:35,060
And so sometimes with baby shoes or young children's shoes, we don't want to tie them because that's too hard.

157
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,959
So we have Velcro.

158
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,379
This is a kind of fabric, like you said, that sticks together.

159
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,240
We don't have to spend all this time tying things.

160
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,600
So you see Velcro on hats, on gloves, on jackets, on shoes.

161
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:55,939
It's a very popular way to make things, close things or to keep things secure.

162
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,399
In a very easy way, right?

163
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,939
You just push them together and that's it.

164
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,680
They're sealed.

165
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,220
Exactly.

166
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,740
So the next time you see it, now you know that it's called Velcro.

167
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,420
I imagine in other languages it's probably called the same thing.

168
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:07,699
Well, right.

169
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:09,040
It's the brand name.

170
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,420
Yeah.

171
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:09,800
Yeah.

172
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,079
So, okay.

173
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,339
And well, now moving on to the parts of the shoe, we have the tongue.

174
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,360
Okay, well think about the body part, the tongue, right?

175
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,959
When you look at your tongue, it's straight and it's flat and it kind of curves at the bottom.

176
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,300
Right.

177
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,160
Well, on a shoe, when you're putting your shoe on and the front of the shoe can get stuck, you have to pull the tongue.

178
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,000
It's a piece of fabric or piece of the shoe where the top of your foot is.

179
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,460
Yeah, very good.

180
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,940
So that's called the tongue.

181
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,259
Now, some shoes have a very small tongue or a low one.

182
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,879
Another have a very high one.

183
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,279
Like for example, Chuck Taylors, they have a big tongue.

184
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
That's right, very long tongue.

185
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,820
And so the tongue is the part that rests on top of your foot.

186
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,940
And usually the shoelaces are over the tongue.

187
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,799
And now moving on to the bottom part of the shoe, that's called the sole.

188
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,240
Okay, S-O-L-E, sole.

189
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:06,419
This is a really important part of shoes.

190
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:13,740
I always look at the sole before I buy a pair of shoes because this is the part that you use the most because you're walking on the ground.

191
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:26,559
So for example, hiking boots, they will have a very high sole and they will have kind of like a pattern so that you don't slip if you're walking on dirt, right?

192
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,220
That's right.

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,519
Sometimes rubber, a rubber sole.

194
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,860
But other times like Chuck Taylors also have a rubber sole but it's very thin.

195
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,639
It's very thin.

196
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:44,500
And some shoes, for example, they have a plastic sole maybe because they're used for other purposes so they might be a little bit slippery if you go on to a smooth surface.

197
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,220
So the sole, that's the bottom part of the shoe.

198
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,220
And the last part of the shoe that we're going to take a look at and probably the most important are the shoe laces.

199
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,779
Shoe laces.

200
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:05,279
So shoe laces are basically long pieces of string that you use to tie your shoes closed because you want your shoes to be tight on your foot.

201
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,759
You don't want it to be too loose, otherwise it might fall off.

202
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:17,100
And Chuck Taylors and some other shoes are very famous for having crazy colored laces or for people using crazy colored laces to tie them up.

203
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:17,460
Right.

204
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,059
So that's the part they use to tie or tighten the shoe with.

205
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:25,860
So on the opposite, if a shoe doesn't have shoe laces, it's probably going to have velcro.

206
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:26,340
That's right.

207
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,620
Velcro or shoe laces.

208
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,080
Okay.

209
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,059
So those are all the words that we have for you today.

210
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,580
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for the last time.

211
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,879
Hi.

212
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,860
I'm looking for a pair of shoes for my son.

213
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:46,759
Sure thing.

214
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,740
Here we are.

215
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,240
If you're looking for dress shoes, we have several different styles of Oxford for boys.

216
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:55,019
We also carry athletic shoes, hiking boots.

217
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,620
Oh, Jacob, how about these sneakers?

218
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,100
Mom, they've got velcro.

219
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,179
Well, then how about these?

220
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:03,539
What is this style called?

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,879
They're tennis shoes.

222
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:07,700
They're very popular with teens and young adults.

223
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:09,940
Oh, Mom, can I get these?

224
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,399
What are those?

225
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,840
They're Chuck Taylors.

226
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,080
Everyone has them.

227
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,519
Can I please?

228
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,059
I don't know.

229
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:18,399
Would they go with your clothes?

230
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,000
The backs are really high and the way the tongue just sticks up, they're almost like a boot.

231
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,639
And the sole doesn't look like it would have a very good grip.

232
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:27,120
They're only $45.

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,659
And they've got cool fluorescent orange shoelaces.

234
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:31,980
Mom!

235
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,080
Mom!

236
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,039
Okay, try them on.

237
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:36,480
What size are your feet?

238
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:37,799
Here's a size 9.

239
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,700
We'll try a size 43 on you first and see how that fits.

240
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,299
A what?

241
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,360
They come in European sizes.

242
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,179
He should be a size 43.

243
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,539
I'll be right back.

244
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,519
Alright, so talking about shoes, you say that you always take a look at the sole.

245
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,220
Why is this?

246
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,399
Because I'm always afraid that my shoes are going to wear out.

247
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,460
And I don't buy shoes very often.

248
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,340
I love sneakers.

249
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,659
I love my pumas.

250
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,740
And I love flat shoes.

251
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,639
And so when you buy a pair of shoes you really like, you don't want to buy another pair in six months.

252
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,240
You want to get a pair that has a really good sole so that will last for a long time.

253
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:20,840
Right, right.

254
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:21,600
Yeah, that's true.

255
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:28,740
I think for me, yeah, that's probably one of the most important parts is the sole as long as it's comfortable.

256
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,279
Because some soles of some shoes can be very rigid.

257
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,320
So it's a little bit uncomfortable to walk with.

258
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,879
But I don't know.

259
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,019
I don't really have that many pairs of shoes if I think about it.

260
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,960
Well, most people have one fancy pair of shoes for special occasions.

261
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,759
And then a pair of work shoes that are leather.

262
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:51,460
And then maybe a couple pairs of sneakers and some sandals for the summer.

263
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,779
So you have sandals and you have flip flops.

264
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,480
Or are they the same?

265
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,600
Well, sandals is basically a kind of shoe.

266
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,360
It's an open shoe that you wear in the summer.

267
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:03,700
Flip flops are a kind of sandal.

268
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,419
So they usually have a V in the front and that's where you put your big toe.

269
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:09,639
In the second toe.

270
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,240
Yeah, so we wear them in the shower or at the beach.

271
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:15,120
They're usually made of plastic or rubber so that you can get them wet.

272
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,019
But flip flops are a kind of sandal.

273
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,019
Yeah, very good.

274
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,639
It's very interesting how many styles and types of shoes.

275
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,279
And actually for men, I think it's not that complicated.

276
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,659
But when we get into women's shoes, then we'll see a lot of different things.

277
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
There are too many styles.

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,919
I can't keep track.

279
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,759
Alright, so that's all the time we have for today.

280
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,240
But we'll see you guys on the website.

281
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,879
If you have any questions, any doubts.

282
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,960
Or if you just want to chat with us, we'll see you at EnglishPod.com.

283
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,840
See you guys there.

284
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:44,519
Alright, bye.
