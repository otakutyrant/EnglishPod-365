EnglishPod.com Hi, I'm looking for a pair of shoes for my son.

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,800
Sure thing.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:11,759
Here we are.

4
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:16,239
If you're looking for dress shoes, we have several different styles of Oxford for boys.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,000
We also carry athletic shoes, hiking boots...

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,640
Oh, Jacob, how about these sneakers?

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,079
Mom, they've got Velcro!

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,199
Well, then how about these?

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,559
What is this style called?

10
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,920
They're tennis shoes.

11
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:31,760
They're very popular with teens and young adults.

12
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:33,960
Oh, Mom, can I get these?

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,399
What are those?

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,899
They're Chuck Taylors.

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,100
Everyone has them.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,539
Can I please?

17
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:41,079
I don't know.

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,479
Would they go with your clothes?

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,039
The backs are really high and the way the tongue just sticks up, they're almost like a boot.

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,640
And the sole doesn't look like it would have a very good grip.

21
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,159
They're only $45.

22
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,679
And they've got cool fluorescent orange shoelaces.

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,840
Mom!

24
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,119
Mom!

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,079
Okay, try them on.

26
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,500
What size are your feet?

27
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,820
Here's a size 9.

28
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,739
We'll try a size 43 on you first and see how that fits.

29
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:07,299
A what?

30
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,379
They come in European sizes.

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,200
He should be a size 43.

32
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:12,640
I'll be right back.
