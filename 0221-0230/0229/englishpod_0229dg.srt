EnglishPod.com Hi, I'm looking for a pair of shoes for my son.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sure thing.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here we are.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If you're looking for dress shoes, we have several different styles of Oxford for boys.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We also carry athletic shoes, hiking boots...

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh, Jacob, how about these sneakers?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Mom, they've got Velcro!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, then how about these?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What is this style called?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They're tennis shoes.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They're very popular with teens and young adults.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, Mom, can I get these?

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What are those?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
They're Chuck Taylors.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Everyone has them.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Can I please?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't know.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Would they go with your clothes?

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The backs are really high and the way the tongue just sticks up, they're almost like a boot.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And the sole doesn't look like it would have a very good grip.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They're only $45.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And they've got cool fluorescent orange shoelaces.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Mom!

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Mom!

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay, try them on.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What size are your feet?

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Here's a size 9.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We'll try a size 43 on you first and see how that fits.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A what?

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They come in European sizes.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He should be a size 43.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll be right back.
