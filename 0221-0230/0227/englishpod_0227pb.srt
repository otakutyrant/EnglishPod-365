00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking about weddings.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are having a wedding, but we're actually planning other things out for the wedding.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So there are lots of things to think about when you're planning a wedding, and I don't think that the woman in today's dialogue has forgotten anything.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's take a listen to the dialogue first, and we'll be back in a moment.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Trina, will you marry me?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes, yes, yes!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Jared, of course I'll marry you.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, babe, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I can't wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and the laughter.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, Jared, I can't wait for our wedding.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I hope you don't mind, but I've already chosen a date, six months from now in the summer.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Melissa saw you buying the ring last month, so I had plenty of time to start planning.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
She what?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I didn't know when you were going to propose.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It was still a nice surprise.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
As I was saying, I've got it all planned out.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There's almost nothing left to do.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I wrote up our guest list, and we will have roughly 400 guests attending.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Four hundred?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No need to sweat it.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be a low budget anyway.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So roughly 400 people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception venue.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents' church, and my uncle, of course, would be officiating.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
My cousin will be the official photographer.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer?

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Erm...

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet, and we'll get the youth group to serve us.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night, though they might have to turn it down a bit.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Or we could hire a DJ.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What's her name again?

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was thinking that we could have an island paradise themed wedding, and our theme colour would be a soothing blue-like aquamarine.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favours?

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Who else am I missing?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, your uncle could be our florist, and his wife could make our wedding cake!

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh wow.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
See?

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's going to be wonderful!

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If I survive the next six months...

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Alright, we're back, so she talked a lot.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So there are a lot of words and phrases here that we're going to take a look at, so let's start with a couple of them on language takeaway.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Language takeaway.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Alright, so on language takeaway, why don't we start off with the first word, and the basic one.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Before you start to plan a wedding, the guy needs to propose.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Or the woman.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's be 21st century here, normally it's the man, but to propose in this instance means to propose marriage.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So basically this is the part where someone gets down on his knee and he says, you know, sweetie pie, I want to be with you forever, will you marry me?

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
To propose.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So to propose is to ask someone to marry you.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's right.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But it can also mean something else, right?

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
To suggest.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So I could propose an idea, or I could propose a plan.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But in this case, to propose has another meaning, and it's basically to ask someone to marry you.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Very good.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So now we've proposed to someone, so we need to start planning our wedding, and I think one of the first steps is you need to know how many people are going to be there and who you're going to invite.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's right.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So when you're planning a wedding, you have to think about the people that are going to attend the wedding, so you prepare a guest list.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay, so a guest list.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now it's pretty simple, right?

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You have a list where you put everyone's name there, and you know how many people are coming.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
A guest list.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Now you have your guest list, and now you need to pick a place where your wedding will be.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So we often talk about two parts to a wedding.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The first part is the ceremony, the wedding ceremony.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Maybe if you're religious, that happens in a church.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But there's a party afterwards, and that's what we're talking about here.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We're talking about a reception.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A reception is basically the party part of the wedding, where you drink and eat and listen to music and dance, so obviously for that you need a space, a place to have the party, and we call it the reception venue.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay, a venue.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So as you said, the reception is the party, and the venue is the place where you have it.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Now a venue is not a specific word, right?

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You can use venue for many different places.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So for example, someone's having a concert.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I can ask him, hey, what's the venue?

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That means what is the theater, or where's this place you're going to have the concert?

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay, so for example, a stadium can be a venue, or a restaurant can be a venue.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Exactly.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So a venue is a place where an event can be held.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Very good.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So now we have our reception venue, we have our guest list, and the girl was talking about her uncle officiating.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What does she mean by to officiate?

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay, so like you said, the verb here is to officiate.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Her uncle will be officiating.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That means he will be the person who marries them.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So maybe you've seen movies before where there's a priest who says, you know, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife till death do you part?

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That person who says that, the person who asks the questions, he or she officiates.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Officiates.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, so that's basically the action of marrying someone or leading the ceremony.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And in America, this isn't just anybody.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Someone has to have a license or has to be a priest and has to have the authority to officiate.

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, very good.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So that's a very interesting word there, to officiate.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Now moving on, when we talk about the food for the reception venue, well, we need somebody to cook it and prepare it, and that's when we hire caterers.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's right.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So a caterer is kind of like a cook, but a caterer basically arranges a meal for many people, and usually the person will bring the food to you.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So for example, if we're going to have a party, Marco, and we're going to throw it at a venue 10 miles away, the caterer will bring the food to us.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay, so that's a caterer.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So you get someone to cater your wedding.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's right, or cater a party.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So I've had parties before that I've called caterers to make the food for.

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So basically they work with me and I tell them the kind of food I would like and they prepare it.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay, very good.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And now for our last part for the wedding planning.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You have the food, you have the venue, you have everything, but you also need to decorate a little bit, and this is when you call a florist.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Florist.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So this sounds a lot like flower, right?

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Florist flower, and then that's basically what this person does.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
A florist is a person who prepares flowers or who cuts flowers and uses them to decorate.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay, so you go to the florist to buy flowers, roses, and different types of things.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay, a florist.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Very good.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So six key words there that are related to planning a wedding.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why don't we move on now to a couple of phrases on Fluency Builder.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
All right, so this first phrase is a really good one.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's a little bit gross.

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We're talking about sweat.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The woman in this dialogue says, hey, no need to sweat it.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So what does this mean?

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
All right, so if you say to sweat means when you're running, you're doing exercise, it's hot, water starts to come out of your skin, right?

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But if the person says, hey, don't sweat it or no need to sweat it, it's a colloquial way of saying don't worry.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay, so we're not actually talking about sweat here.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So maybe Marco, you and I are working on a project together, and I say, listen, Marco, I'm so sorry, I have a family emergency, I can't finish the project with you, would you be able to help me out?

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm so sorry.

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Sure, sure.

148
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Don't sweat it.

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's not a problem.

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay, so don't worry.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't worry.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Right.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So if you tell someone to not sweat it, don't sweat it or no need to sweat it, you're basically telling them it's okay, it's not a problem, everything is going to be fine.

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Great.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So the next phrase here is also kind of relaxed, it's kind of laid back.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So the woman is still describing some of the things she's prepared for the wedding and she says, hey, listen, don't worry, the music was a no brainer.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, no brainer.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay, this is really easy.

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, your brain is inside your head, right?

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So if you say no brainer, it's basically saying you don't have to think about it too much or it's very easy, very simple.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay, so I was deciding on where to go on vacation and the options were Thailand or Antarctica.

162
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's a no brainer.

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Right.

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Obviously, I want to go where it's sunny and warm.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So a no brainer means I didn't even have to think about it.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It was that easy.

167
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Right.

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That decision making was a no brainer.

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
All right, so for our next phrase, the girl was also talking about the music and she was talking about a band, maybe like a rock band.

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And she said, well, maybe they could play, but they would need to tone it down.

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, so this is a favorite phrase of parents, I think, all over the English speaking world.

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Tone it down.

173
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
In this case, we're talking about music.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So maybe like you said, the friend's band is a rock and roll band and it's really loud and angry and in your face, but for a wedding, that's not appropriate.

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So to tone it down means to make it more appropriate for the occasion.

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So maybe less loud or no offensive language or no swear words.

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Right.

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's basically what tone it down means, right?

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If someone says you need to tone it down, it's a little bit more direct.

180
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Like you said, if your parents tell you this, it's maybe because you're being a little bit too loud or you're yelling or you're being irresponsible.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So that's why your parents would tell you, hey, you need to tone it down a bit.

182
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's right.

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Or sometimes we have this in the office where someone doesn't understand how to communicate in a positive way.

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And so they say, oh, that paper you did was really bad.

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It was stupid.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't ever want to see it again.

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Say, well, maybe you need to tone it down a little bit.

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Think about the words you're using and make them a little bit less harsh.

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So kind of to relax, to reduce your level of being aggressive, of being loud.

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's to tone it down.

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Exactly.

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay.

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
A lot of great phrases there.

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Why don't we now go back, listen to our great dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Trina, will you marry me?

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes!

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes!

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Jared, of course I'll marry you.

199
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh, babe, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can't wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and the laughter.

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh, Jared, I can't wait for our wedding.

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I hope you don't mind, but I've already chosen a date, six months from now in the summer.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Melissa saw you buying the ring last month, so I had plenty of time to start planning.

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
She what?

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh, well, don't worry, sweetie.

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I didn't know when you were going to propose.

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It was still a nice surprise.

209
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
As I was saying, I've got it all planned out.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There's almost nothing left to do.

211
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I wrote up our guest list, and we will have roughly 400 guests attending.

212
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Four hundred?

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No need to sweat it.

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be a low budget anyway.

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So roughly 400 people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception venue.

216
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents' church, and my uncle, of course, would be officiating.

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling.

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer.

219
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
My stepsister and her string quartet will take care of that.

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
My cousin will be the official photographer.

221
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo.

222
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer?

223
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And then, of course, the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet, and will get the youth group to serve us.

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night, though they might have to turn it down a bit.

225
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Or we could hire a DJ.

226
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings.

227
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What's their name again?

228
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I was thinking that we could have an island paradise themed wedding, and our theme color would be a soothing blue-like aquamarine, and there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts.

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors?

230
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Who else am I missing?

231
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, your uncle could be our florist, and his wife could make our wedding cake.

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh, wow.

233
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
See?

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's going to be wonderful.

235
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh, this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If I survive the next six months.

237
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
All right, so about weddings and planning out a wedding, do you think 400 guests is a small wedding?

238
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No.

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I think this woman is out of control.

240
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:06,000
In fact, in English, we have a word for a bride or a woman who's getting married that describes someone who's completely nuts about the wedding.

241
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We call her a bridezilla.

242
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Bridezilla.

243
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Like Godzilla.

244
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Exactly.

245
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The movie Godzilla, he's a monster.

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And he's out of control.

247
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He's out of control.

248
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And a bride who's so obsessed with her wedding that nothing else is important, she is a bridezilla.

249
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Now it's a very big thing for a woman, right?

250
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
For her wedding to be nice and perfect and everything.

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Do you think guys are more relaxed in this sense?

252
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't know.

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think it depends on the guy.

254
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
As always, there are some people who want to be very involved and some people who don't care.

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But in general, I think men are less worried about the details.

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Just as long as there's a wedding, it's fine.

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Exactly.

258
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Although a lot of men, when the wedding actually happens, start to get very nervous.

259
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh, but kind of like having doubts, maybe cold feet.

260
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes, cold feet.

261
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Like should I get married?

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Should I not get married?

263
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Uh-oh.

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I think it's very interesting because you see this in movies a lot.

265
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I've always wondered how often or how common is it for a guy or a girl to say no or to leave a wedding when it has already started.

266
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Because you know, you have invited all these people, all these friends and family, maybe people who came from different countries, and food is paid for, venue.

267
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You spend so much money on a wedding and for you to say no.

268
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know how common it is.

269
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's very common in movies, but I really don't know anyone who's experienced this.

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't either, actually, now that you bring it up.

271
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So maybe we could talk about this.

272
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Is this common in your country?

273
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
First of all, do people spend a lot of money on weddings?

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And second of all, have you ever heard of someone actually leaving the wedding before they finished?

275
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah, during the ceremony.

276
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Not before, during.

277
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,000
During the ceremony.

278
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So our website is EnglishPod.com.

279
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We hope to see you there.

280
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Until next time.

281
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Bye.

282
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Bye.
