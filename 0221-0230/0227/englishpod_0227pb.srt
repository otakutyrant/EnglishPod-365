00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,059
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:05,759
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,140
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking about weddings.

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:10,160
That's right.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,439
We are having a wedding, but we're actually planning other things out for the wedding.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,260
That's right.

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:22,579
So there are lots of things to think about when you're planning a wedding, and I don't think that the woman in today's dialogue has forgotten anything.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,420
Let's take a listen to the dialogue first, and we'll be back in a moment.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,320
Trina, will you marry me?

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,060
Yes, yes, yes!

11
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,020
Jared, of course I'll marry you.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,719
Oh, babe, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

13
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:48,340
I can't wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and the laughter.

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,299
I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.

15
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:53,500
Oh, Jared, I can't wait for our wedding.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,939
I hope you don't mind, but I've already chosen a date, six months from now in the summer.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,420
Melissa saw you buying the ring last month, so I had plenty of time to start planning.

18
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:03,600
She what?

19
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,540
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,420
I didn't know when you were going to propose.

21
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,159
It was still a nice surprise.

22
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,040
As I was saying, I've got it all planned out.

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,560
There's almost nothing left to do.

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,819
I wrote up our guest list, and we will have roughly 400 guests attending.

25
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,060
Four hundred?

26
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,799
No need to sweat it.

27
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:25,760
My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be a low budget anyway.

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,459
So roughly 400 people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception venue.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,379
I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents' church, and my uncle, of course, would be officiating.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,260
We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling.

31
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,819
The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer.

32
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,099
My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that.

33
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,260
My cousin will be the official photographer.

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,359
I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo.

35
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,120
Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer?

36
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,659
Erm...

37
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:59,099
And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet, and we'll get the youth group to serve us.

38
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,620
I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night, though they might have to turn it down a bit.

39
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,359
Or we could hire a DJ.

40
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:10,580
Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings.

41
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,800
What's her name again?

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,500
I was thinking that we could have an island paradise themed wedding, and our theme colour would be a soothing blue-like aquamarine.

43
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,800
And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts.

44
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,319
What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favours?

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,719
Who else am I missing?

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,699
Oh, your uncle could be our florist, and his wife could make our wedding cake!

47
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:33,080
Oh wow.

48
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,000
See?

49
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,259
It's going to be wonderful!

50
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,080
Oh, this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.

51
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,979
If I survive the next six months...

52
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,159
Alright, we're back, so she talked a lot.

53
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,319
So there are a lot of words and phrases here that we're going to take a look at, so let's start with a couple of them on language takeaway.

54
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,580
Language takeaway.

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,080
Alright, so on language takeaway, why don't we start off with the first word, and the basic one.

56
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,819
Before you start to plan a wedding, the guy needs to propose.

57
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,900
Or the woman.

58
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,340
Let's be 21st century here, normally it's the man, but to propose in this instance means to propose marriage.

59
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:25,740
So basically this is the part where someone gets down on his knee and he says, you know, sweetie pie, I want to be with you forever, will you marry me?

60
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:26,659
To propose.

61
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,240
So to propose is to ask someone to marry you.

62
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,699
That's right.

63
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,219
But it can also mean something else, right?

64
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,439
To suggest.

65
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:33,379
That's right.

66
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,979
So I could propose an idea, or I could propose a plan.

67
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:45,159
But in this case, to propose has another meaning, and it's basically to ask someone to marry you.

68
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,500
Okay.

69
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,560
Very good.

70
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:56,479
So now we've proposed to someone, so we need to start planning our wedding, and I think one of the first steps is you need to know how many people are going to be there and who you're going to invite.

71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,400
That's right.

72
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:04,300
So when you're planning a wedding, you have to think about the people that are going to attend the wedding, so you prepare a guest list.

73
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,199
Okay, so a guest list.

74
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,639
Now it's pretty simple, right?

75
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,319
You have a list where you put everyone's name there, and you know how many people are coming.

76
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,520
Okay.

77
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:14,680
A guest list.

78
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,720
Now you have your guest list, and now you need to pick a place where your wedding will be.

79
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,500
That's right.

80
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,959
So we often talk about two parts to a wedding.

81
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,300
The first part is the ceremony, the wedding ceremony.

82
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:30,300
Maybe if you're religious, that happens in a church.

83
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:30,759
Okay.

84
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,779
But there's a party afterwards, and that's what we're talking about here.

85
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,199
We're talking about a reception.

86
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:36,839
Okay.

87
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:49,339
A reception is basically the party part of the wedding, where you drink and eat and listen to music and dance, so obviously for that you need a space, a place to have the party, and we call it the reception venue.

88
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,699
Okay, a venue.

89
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,100
So as you said, the reception is the party, and the venue is the place where you have it.

90
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,379
Now a venue is not a specific word, right?

91
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:02,579
You can use venue for many different places.

92
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,360
That's right.

93
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,540
So for example, someone's having a concert.

94
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,740
I can ask him, hey, what's the venue?

95
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,480
Okay.

96
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,120
That means what is the theater, or where's this place you're going to have the concert?

97
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,579
Okay, so for example, a stadium can be a venue, or a restaurant can be a venue.

98
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,139
Exactly.

99
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,019
So a venue is a place where an event can be held.

100
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:23,620
Okay.

101
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:24,680
Very good.

102
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,740
So now we have our reception venue, we have our guest list, and the girl was talking about her uncle officiating.

103
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,379
What does she mean by to officiate?

104
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,379
Okay, so like you said, the verb here is to officiate.

105
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,399
Her uncle will be officiating.

106
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,500
That means he will be the person who marries them.

107
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:53,160
So maybe you've seen movies before where there's a priest who says, you know, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife till death do you part?

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,560
That person who says that, the person who asks the questions, he or she officiates.

109
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,339
Officiates.

110
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, so that's basically the action of marrying someone or leading the ceremony.

111
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:07,680
That's right.

112
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,579
And in America, this isn't just anybody.

113
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:17,819
Someone has to have a license or has to be a priest and has to have the authority to officiate.

114
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,339
Okay, very good.

115
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,519
So that's a very interesting word there, to officiate.

116
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:31,339
Now moving on, when we talk about the food for the reception venue, well, we need somebody to cook it and prepare it, and that's when we hire caterers.

117
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,199
That's right.

118
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:44,680
So a caterer is kind of like a cook, but a caterer basically arranges a meal for many people, and usually the person will bring the food to you.

119
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,860
So for example, if we're going to have a party, Marco, and we're going to throw it at a venue 10 miles away, the caterer will bring the food to us.

120
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,480
Okay, so that's a caterer.

121
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,139
So you get someone to cater your wedding.

122
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,920
That's right, or cater a party.

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,379
So I've had parties before that I've called caterers to make the food for.

124
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,319
So basically they work with me and I tell them the kind of food I would like and they prepare it.

125
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,500
Okay, very good.

126
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,819
And now for our last part for the wedding planning.

127
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:22,899
You have the food, you have the venue, you have everything, but you also need to decorate a little bit, and this is when you call a florist.

128
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:23,920
Florist.

129
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,899
So this sounds a lot like flower, right?

130
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,040
Florist flower, and then that's basically what this person does.

131
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,660
A florist is a person who prepares flowers or who cuts flowers and uses them to decorate.

132
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,180
Okay, so you go to the florist to buy flowers, roses, and different types of things.

133
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,199
Okay, a florist.

134
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,100
Very good.

135
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,160
So six key words there that are related to planning a wedding.

136
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,819
Why don't we move on now to a couple of phrases on Fluency Builder.

137
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,279
All right, so this first phrase is a really good one.

138
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,860
It's a little bit gross.

139
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:06,259
We're talking about sweat.

140
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,019
The woman in this dialogue says, hey, no need to sweat it.

141
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,339
So what does this mean?

142
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:21,779
All right, so if you say to sweat means when you're running, you're doing exercise, it's hot, water starts to come out of your skin, right?

143
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:30,019
But if the person says, hey, don't sweat it or no need to sweat it, it's a colloquial way of saying don't worry.

144
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:33,039
Okay, so we're not actually talking about sweat here.

145
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:43,759
So maybe Marco, you and I are working on a project together, and I say, listen, Marco, I'm so sorry, I have a family emergency, I can't finish the project with you, would you be able to help me out?

146
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,460
I'm so sorry.

147
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,059
Sure, sure.

148
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:45,960
Don't sweat it.

149
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,879
It's not a problem.

150
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,580
Okay, so don't worry.

151
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,220
Don't worry.

152
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:49,799
Right.

153
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:58,820
So if you tell someone to not sweat it, don't sweat it or no need to sweat it, you're basically telling them it's okay, it's not a problem, everything is going to be fine.

154
00:08:59,139 --> 00:08:59,299
Great.

155
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,279
So the next phrase here is also kind of relaxed, it's kind of laid back.

156
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:11,259
So the woman is still describing some of the things she's prepared for the wedding and she says, hey, listen, don't worry, the music was a no brainer.

157
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,480
Okay, no brainer.

158
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,940
Okay, this is really easy.

159
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,480
Well, your brain is inside your head, right?

160
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:25,100
So if you say no brainer, it's basically saying you don't have to think about it too much or it's very easy, very simple.

161
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:33,720
Okay, so I was deciding on where to go on vacation and the options were Thailand or Antarctica.

162
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,320
That's a no brainer.

163
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:35,659
Right.

164
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,559
Obviously, I want to go where it's sunny and warm.

165
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,919
So a no brainer means I didn't even have to think about it.

166
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,139
It was that easy.

167
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:43,519
Right.

168
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,580
That decision making was a no brainer.

169
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,820
All right, so for our next phrase, the girl was also talking about the music and she was talking about a band, maybe like a rock band.

170
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:58,620
And she said, well, maybe they could play, but they would need to tone it down.

171
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:04,139
Okay, so this is a favorite phrase of parents, I think, all over the English speaking world.

172
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,399
Tone it down.

173
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,600
In this case, we're talking about music.

174
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:17,720
So maybe like you said, the friend's band is a rock and roll band and it's really loud and angry and in your face, but for a wedding, that's not appropriate.

175
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,860
So to tone it down means to make it more appropriate for the occasion.

176
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:28,460
So maybe less loud or no offensive language or no swear words.

177
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:28,879
Right.

178
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,919
That's basically what tone it down means, right?

179
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,580
If someone says you need to tone it down, it's a little bit more direct.

180
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:43,120
Like you said, if your parents tell you this, it's maybe because you're being a little bit too loud or you're yelling or you're being irresponsible.

181
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,820
So that's why your parents would tell you, hey, you need to tone it down a bit.

182
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,379
That's right.

183
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,980
Or sometimes we have this in the office where someone doesn't understand how to communicate in a positive way.

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,179
And so they say, oh, that paper you did was really bad.

185
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:58,799
It was stupid.

186
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,200
I don't ever want to see it again.

187
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,320
Say, well, maybe you need to tone it down a little bit.

188
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,080
Think about the words you're using and make them a little bit less harsh.

189
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:15,220
So kind of to relax, to reduce your level of being aggressive, of being loud.

190
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,600
That's to tone it down.

191
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,139
Exactly.

192
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:17,679
Okay.

193
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,340
A lot of great phrases there.

194
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,679
Why don't we now go back, listen to our great dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

195
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,200
Trina, will you marry me?

196
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,940
Yes!

197
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,360
Yes!

198
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,919
Jared, of course I'll marry you.

199
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,600
Oh, babe, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

200
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,200
I can't wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and the laughter.

201
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:50,159
I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.

202
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,419
Oh, Jared, I can't wait for our wedding.

203
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,799
I hope you don't mind, but I've already chosen a date, six months from now in the summer.

204
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:01,299
Melissa saw you buying the ring last month, so I had plenty of time to start planning.

205
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,480
She what?

206
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,440
Oh, well, don't worry, sweetie.

207
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,320
I didn't know when you were going to propose.

208
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:08,039
It was still a nice surprise.

209
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,919
As I was saying, I've got it all planned out.

210
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:12,460
There's almost nothing left to do.

211
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,679
I wrote up our guest list, and we will have roughly 400 guests attending.

212
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,940
Four hundred?

213
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,659
No need to sweat it.

214
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,620
My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be a low budget anyway.

215
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,340
So roughly 400 people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception venue.

216
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,299
I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents' church, and my uncle, of course, would be officiating.

217
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,120
We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling.

218
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,700
The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer.

219
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,000
My stepsister and her string quartet will take care of that.

220
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,139
My cousin will be the official photographer.

221
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,220
I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo.

222
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,980
Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer?

223
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:58,059
And then, of course, the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet, and will get the youth group to serve us.

224
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,539
I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night, though they might have to turn it down a bit.

225
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,259
Or we could hire a DJ.

226
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,480
Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings.

227
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,679
What's their name again?

228
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:21,679
I was thinking that we could have an island paradise themed wedding, and our theme color would be a soothing blue-like aquamarine, and there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts.

229
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:25,159
What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors?

230
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,620
Who else am I missing?

231
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,620
Oh, your uncle could be our florist, and his wife could make our wedding cake.

232
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:31,940
Oh, wow.

233
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:32,879
See?

234
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,159
It's going to be wonderful.

235
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh, this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.

236
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,580
If I survive the next six months.

237
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:53,919
All right, so about weddings and planning out a wedding, do you think 400 guests is a small wedding?

238
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:54,820
No.

239
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,620
I think this woman is out of control.

240
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:06,940
In fact, in English, we have a word for a bride or a woman who's getting married that describes someone who's completely nuts about the wedding.

241
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,620
We call her a bridezilla.

242
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,639
Bridezilla.

243
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,720
Like Godzilla.

244
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,379
Exactly.

245
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:13,179
The movie Godzilla, he's a monster.

246
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,120
And he's out of control.

247
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:14,940
He's out of control.

248
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:21,120
And a bride who's so obsessed with her wedding that nothing else is important, she is a bridezilla.

249
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,360
Now it's a very big thing for a woman, right?

250
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,759
For her wedding to be nice and perfect and everything.

251
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,580
Do you think guys are more relaxed in this sense?

252
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:29,580
I don't know.

253
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,940
I think it depends on the guy.

254
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:35,539
As always, there are some people who want to be very involved and some people who don't care.

255
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:40,639
But in general, I think men are less worried about the details.

256
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,460
Just as long as there's a wedding, it's fine.

257
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,019
Exactly.

258
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,519
Although a lot of men, when the wedding actually happens, start to get very nervous.

259
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,740
Oh, but kind of like having doubts, maybe cold feet.

260
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:52,840
Yes, cold feet.

261
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,279
Like should I get married?

262
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,299
Should I not get married?

263
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:55,919
Uh-oh.

264
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:59,519
I think it's very interesting because you see this in movies a lot.

265
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:10,720
And I've always wondered how often or how common is it for a guy or a girl to say no or to leave a wedding when it has already started.

266
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:18,720
Because you know, you have invited all these people, all these friends and family, maybe people who came from different countries, and food is paid for, venue.

267
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,259
You spend so much money on a wedding and for you to say no.

268
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,159
I don't know how common it is.

269
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:28,559
It's very common in movies, but I really don't know anyone who's experienced this.

270
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,480
I don't either, actually, now that you bring it up.

271
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,179
So maybe we could talk about this.

272
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,600
Is this common in your country?

273
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,200
First of all, do people spend a lot of money on weddings?

274
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,240
And second of all, have you ever heard of someone actually leaving the wedding before they finished?

275
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,960
Yeah, during the ceremony.

276
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:44,899
Not before, during.

277
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,860
During the ceremony.

278
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,240
So our website is EnglishPod.com.

279
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,179
We hope to see you there.

280
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,120
Until next time.

281
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,559
Bye.

282
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:53,860
Bye.
