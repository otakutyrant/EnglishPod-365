00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Trina, will you marry me?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, yes, yes!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Jared, of course I'll marry you!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh babe, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I can't wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and the laughter.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh Jared, I can't wait for our wedding.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I hope you don't mind, but I've already chosen a date.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Six months from now in the summer.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Melissa saw you buying the ring last month, so I had plenty of time to start planning.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
She what?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh well don't worry sweetie, I didn't know when you were going to propose.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It was still a nice surprise.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
As I was saying, I've got it all planned out, there's almost nothing left to do.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I wrote up our guest list, and we will have roughly 400 guests attending.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Four hundred?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No need to sweat it.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be a low budget anyway.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So roughly 400 people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception venue.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents' church, and my uncle of course would be officiating.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counselling.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The music for the wedding ceremony was a no brainer.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
My stepsister and her string quartet will take care of that.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My cousin will be the official photographer.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer?

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet, and we'll get the youth group to serve us.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night, though they might have to turn it down a bit.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Or we could hire a DJ.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's their name again?

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was thinking that we could have an island paradise themed wedding, and our theme colour would be a soothing blue-like aquamarine.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favours?

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Who else am I missing?

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh, your uncle could be our florist, and his wife could make our wedding cake.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh wow.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
See, it's going to be wonderful.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If I survive the next six months.
