EnglishPod.com OK Sally, we have an artist here to help us.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We'll ask you questions about the bank robber you saw and Paul will draw a picture.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Are you ready?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, well, he had brown hair, long hair, and he had some facial hair.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It was brown too.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Good!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
OK, the facial hair, was it a beard or a moustache?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Both.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
His moustache was very short and thin, just on the top of his lip.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Uh-huh.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hmm, like this?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, that's the moustache, but the beard isn't right.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I mean, it didn't cover his whole face.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I think it was just on his chin.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A goatee?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Was it like Paul's?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Uh, yes, that's it.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
He had a goatee.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
OK, now, what about sideburns?

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Did he have sideburns?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Um, yes, they were long and thick, like yours.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
All right.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
There, was this the man you saw?

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, that's him.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hmm, it looks a lot like you.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hmm, why, yes he does.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Paul, where were you on Friday afternoon?

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What?

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's ridiculous.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It wasn't me.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I didn't do anything.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I was over there doing the thing with the best man.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Thanks for watching!
