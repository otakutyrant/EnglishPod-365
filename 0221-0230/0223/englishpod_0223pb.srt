00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:05,299
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,099
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,080
My name is Catherine, and today we have a very descriptive lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,759
That's right.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,000
We have an elementary lesson for everyone, and we are going to talk about facial hair.

6
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:20,839
Okay, so Marco, you don't have any facial hair.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,320
I don't.

8
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:24,719
Well, I like to shave every other day.

9
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:29,579
But yeah, that's what facial hair is, is hair that you have on your face.

10
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,539
Okay, so we're at the police station in this dialogue.

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,659
Let's take a listen and find out why.

12
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:45,140
Okay, Sally, we have an artist here to help us.

13
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,899
We'll ask you questions about the bank robber you saw, and Paul will draw a picture.

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,579
Are you ready?

15
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:50,560
Yes.

16
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,539
Well, he had brown hair, long hair, and he had some facial hair.

17
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,079
It was brown too.

18
00:00:58,939 --> 00:00:59,259
Good.

19
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,340
Okay, the facial hair, was it a beard or a mustache?

20
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:03,079
Both.

21
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,219
His mustache was very short and thin, just on the top of his lip.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,219
Uh-huh.

23
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:08,719
Hmm.

24
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:09,599
Like this?

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,500
Yes.

26
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,379
That's the mustache.

27
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,060
But the beard isn't right.

28
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,319
I mean, it didn't cover his whole face.

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,060
I think it was just on his chin.

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,359
A goatee?

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,599
Was it like Paul's?

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,120
Uh, yes.

33
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,799
That's it.

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,900
He had a goatee.

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,379
Okay.

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,799
Now, what about sideburns?

37
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,280
Did he have sideburns?

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,840
Um, yes.

39
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,400
They were long and thick.

40
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,140
Like yours.

41
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,500
All right.

42
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:34,739
There.

43
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,060
Was this the man you saw?

44
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,599
Yes, that's him.

45
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,799
Hmm.

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,439
It looks a lot like you.

47
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,439
Hmm.

48
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,840
Why, yes, he does.

49
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,879
Paul, where were you on Friday afternoon?

50
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,519
What?

51
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:48,500
That's ridiculous.

52
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,299
It wasn't me.

53
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,900
I didn't do anything.

54
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,319
I was over there doing the thing with the best man to do to do.

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,760
All right, we're back.

56
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:09,919
So, as you can see, the woman is describing a bank robber, and one of the ways that she's describing him is by the facial hair that he had.

57
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,599
So there are a lot of very interesting words and phrases here.

58
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,319
Why don't we take a look at some of them in Language Takeaway?

59
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,960
Language Takeaway.

60
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:32,539
Okay, so in Language Takeaway today, we have some really good description words and nouns, things that people have on their face, facial hair, because there's not just one kind of facial hair.

61
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,400
There are many different kinds.

62
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,759
So our first one is, are we going to skip facial hair?

63
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,139
Yeah, we already explained it.

64
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,759
Our first one is mustache.

65
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,780
Okay, a mustache.

66
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,439
And this is, I think, one of the more popular forms of facial hair.

67
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:49,919
I think it's a style, right?

68
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,740
All these styles of facial hair.

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,240
That's right.

70
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,240
And so a mustache is basically some hair on top of your lip.

71
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,819
It's above your lip.

72
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,379
And it's usually, it can be thin or thick.

73
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,360
It comes in different sizes, but this is not your whole face.

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,599
It's just above your lip.

75
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,180
All right.

76
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:14,280
So, for example, a famous person or a famous mustache was Charlie Chaplin, right?

77
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:14,919
That's right.

78
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,259
Charlie Chaplin had a mustache, just a little bit of hair above his lip.

79
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:22,800
But also Theodore Roosevelt had a very big, bushy mustache.

80
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,120
That's right.

81
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,680
Interesting fact, you might hear someone say stache instead of mustache.

82
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,580
This is a short way to say it.

83
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,840
So oh, he's growing a stache.

84
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:33,560
Right.

85
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:43,099
And also the spelling can be a little bit difficult to understand how you pronounce it because it's M-U-S-T-A-C-H-E.

86
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,879
So there's no really S-H sound like sh, but you pronounce it mustache.

87
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,039
Mustache, yeah.

88
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,479
So that's one kind of facial hair, but there are many others.

89
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,020
The next one we've got for you is a beard.

90
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,099
A beard, okay.

91
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,759
This is a really good one, a beard.

92
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,419
I think a beard keeps men warm.

93
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,580
I think a beard keeps a man warm in the winter.

94
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,819
Yeah, definitely.

95
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,120
This is the most hair.

96
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:15,120
So basically a beard, you have hair on your lip and also all over your face basically.

97
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,480
So a beard, you have all over your face.

98
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,879
Right, your cheeks, your chin, and above your lip.

99
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,300
Okay, very good.

100
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,319
So a famous person with a beard?

101
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,560
Santa Claus.

102
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,439
Santa Claus has a very big beard.

103
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,839
Yeah, Santa Claus has a big beard.

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,579
Big white beard.

105
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,180
Okay, so that's a beard.

106
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:35,540
I think that's the easiest to have because you don't need to cut anything or shave anything.

107
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,060
Oh, you need to trim.

108
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:37,920
Yeah, you need to.

109
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,399
If you don't trim, it looks kind of bad.

110
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,699
Right.

111
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,620
Well, now moving on to our next style of facial hair, we have a goatee.

112
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,300
Okay, this might be confusing for some people because it's not a beard and it's not a mustache.

113
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:57,759
It's basically hair around your mouth, on your chin and your lip.

114
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,339
So I think Sean Connery has a very famous goatee.

115
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:08,060
And Brad Pitt right now has a really big goatee, or a long goatee, lots of hair.

116
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,100
So it's, as you say, it's around your mouth, so your lip and your chin.

117
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:12,680
That's right, a goatee.

118
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,240
Okay, so that's our third style of facial hair.

119
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:21,279
And now moving on to our last style, we have sideburns.

120
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:25,500
Okay, so think about the word here, sideburns, side.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,839
They're on your side.

122
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,660
They're on the side.

123
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,000
So near the ears, there is usually some space where a man can grow some hair.

124
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,319
Not with a beard or necessarily a mustache, though.

125
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,860
It can be just the hair on the jaw line, near the jaw, near the ears.

126
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,339
So I think this was a very famous style in the 60s and 70s.

127
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,480
You would have long sideburns all along your face.

128
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,300
That's right.

129
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:54,560
Past your ear, right?

130
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,240
That's right.

131
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:59,379
And the longer, maybe the sexier you were.

132
00:05:59,420 --> 00:05:59,980
The sexier, no.

133
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,899
But these days it's not as popular, but you do see people who have sideburns.

134
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,019
I think nowadays people have sideburns, but they're not as thick, they're just like thin little sideburns.

135
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,459
Yeah, that's right.

136
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,620
All right, so all of these are the different sorts and styles of facial hair.

137
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,279
Of course, there are a lot more.

138
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:24,459
I think while we were looking for this on the internet, we found a lot of other styles that came up like mutton chops and things like this.

139
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,540
But these are probably the most popular ones.

140
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,019
That's right.

141
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,060
These are the ones you're going to hear about the most.

142
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,360
So why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

143
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,800
Okay, Sally, we have an artist here to help us.

144
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,540
We'll ask you questions about the bank robber you saw and Paul will draw a picture.

145
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,259
Are you ready?

146
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,199
Yes.

147
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,199
Well, he had brown hair, long hair, and he had some facial hair.

148
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:56,800
It was brown too.

149
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:57,899
Good.

150
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,399
Okay, the facial hair.

151
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,980
Was it a beard or a mustache?

152
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:01,720
Both.

153
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,860
His mustache was very short and thin, just on the top of his lip.

154
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:06,639
Uh-huh.

155
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:07,360
Hmm.

156
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,279
Like this?

157
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,720
Yes, that's the mustache, but the beard isn't right.

158
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,000
I mean, it didn't cover his whole face.

159
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,740
I think it was just on his chin.

160
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,040
A goatee?

161
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,300
Was it like Paul's?

162
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,439
Uh, yes, that's it.

163
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:21,899
He had a goatee.

164
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,019
Okay.

165
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,439
Now, what about sideburns?

166
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,939
Did he have sideburns?

167
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:28,540
Um, yes.

168
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,100
They were long and thick.

169
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:30,819
Like yours.

170
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,019
Alright.

171
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,420
There.

172
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,740
Was this the man you saw?

173
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:36,259
Yes, that's him.

174
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,420
Hmm.

175
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,120
It looks a lot like you.

176
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,160
Hmm.

177
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,579
Why, yes he does.

178
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,579
Paul, where were you on Friday afternoon?

179
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,199
What?

180
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,379
That's ridiculous.

181
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,959
It wasn't me.

182
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,660
I didn't do anything.

183
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,379
I was over there doing the thing with the best man, doo doo doo.

184
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:08,920
Alright, so today in Fluency Builder, we are not really talking about phrases as much as we're talking about adjectives, so words you can use to describe facial hair.

185
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:09,560
Okay.

186
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:17,199
So, when the girl was describing facial hair, for example, she said, the mustache was very short and thin.

187
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,600
Okay.

188
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,639
A short and thin mustache.

189
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,779
So you think about it, you can have a very thick mustache, that's the opposite.

190
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,879
That means very hairy, very wide.

191
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:29,740
A thin mustache is like a line.

192
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:30,439
Okay.

193
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:35,879
Okay, so for example, Charlie Chaplin, he had a short mustache, but it wasn't thin.

194
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,860
It was a little bit thick.

195
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,580
That's right.

196
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,519
It was kind of wide.

197
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:49,620
But you think of, you know, when you see someone who's drawing a mustache on a sign at a restaurant or in a newspaper, that's usually very thin, because they use a pen and it's very silly looking.

198
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,200
Right, so those are different adjectives to describe, not only a mustache.

199
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,220
So basically, we can use these to describe any sort of hair.

200
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,039
For example, the hair on your head, you can say he's got short hair.

201
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:02,960
That's right, or I could say I have long hair.

202
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:03,659
Long hair.

203
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,379
Or Mark, I could say you have thick hair.

204
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:06,620
Yeah.

205
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,120
So, if you have an abundance of hair that you would say it's thick.

206
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,139
That's right.

207
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:11,659
That's right.

208
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:16,360
You know, it's like if you put your hand in it, it feels like there's a lot that's very thick hair.

209
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:16,740
Okay.

210
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,559
Some people have thin hair, so they don't have a lot of hair.

211
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay.

212
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:20,799
Good.

213
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,080
And well, moving on to the parts of the face.

214
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,320
We described it before as to where a mustache is, where a goatee is, but let's take a closer look at that.

215
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,899
For example, a mustache is on your upper lip.

216
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,139
Right, so just above your lip, under your nose, that's where a mustache goes.

217
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:40,919
So that's the upper lip.

218
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,460
But if we're talking about a goatee, it's not just on your upper lip, it's also where?

219
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,539
On your chin.

220
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,379
Your chin.

221
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,720
So that's the very bottom point of your face.

222
00:09:51,700 --> 00:10:02,279
So you have your chin, your upper lip, and also when we talked about, for example, the sideburns, we talked about the jaw, but also it could be part of the cheek.

223
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:02,980
Right.

224
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:11,159
So every person has two cheeks, one on the left and one on the right, and those are a very big part of your face on the sides of your nose.

225
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,179
Okay.

226
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,100
So you have your chin, you have your cheeks, you have your upper lip.

227
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,460
I think that's pretty much the only places where you can grow muscle, also on your neck.

228
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,740
Yeah, some people have it on their neck or on the back of, well, no, it's not there.

229
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,620
Some people also have it on their neck, yeah, that's right.

230
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,419
Right, okay.

231
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,519
Very good.

232
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:34,279
So a lot of different words to describe facial hair.

233
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:39,259
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk some more.

234
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,360
Okay, Sally, we have an artist here to help us.

235
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,139
We'll ask you questions about the bank robber you saw, and Paul will draw a picture.

236
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:53,840
Are you ready?

237
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:54,820
Yes.

238
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,799
Well, he had brown hair, long hair, and he had some facial hair.

239
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,340
It was brown too.

240
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,500
Good.

241
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,580
Okay, the facial hair, was it a beard or a mustache?

242
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:07,340
Both.

243
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,460
His mustache was very short and thin, just on the top of his lip.

244
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,480
Uh-huh.

245
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:12,960
Hmm.

246
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,860
Like this?

247
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,299
Yes, that's the mustache, but the beard isn't right.

248
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,580
I mean, it didn't cover his whole face.

249
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,299
I think it was just on his chin.

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,620
A goatee?

251
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:23,840
Was it like Paul's?

252
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:26,019
Uh, yes, that's it.

253
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,139
He had a goatee.

254
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:28,620
Okay.

255
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,059
Now, what about sideburns?

256
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:32,519
Did he have sideburns?

257
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,419
Um, yes, they were long and thick, like yours.

258
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,620
Alright.

259
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:38,980
There.

260
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,299
Was this the man you saw?

261
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,860
Yes, that's him.

262
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,039
Hmm.

263
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,700
It looks a lot like you.

264
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,659
Hmm.

265
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,100
Why, yes, he does.

266
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,120
Paul, where were you on Friday afternoon?

267
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:50,759
What?

268
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,940
That's ridiculous.

269
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:54,559
It wasn't me.

270
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,159
I didn't do anything.

271
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,940
I was over there doing the thing with the best man.

272
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:10,000
Alright, so talking about facial hair, Catherine, do you like men that have facial hair?

273
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:10,539
Yes.

274
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,299
Yeah, you like mustaches, beards, goatees?

275
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,379
Um, well, it really depends.

276
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,940
I really like sideburns, but sometimes people don't do them correctly, so I don't like them.

277
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,379
I like beards, and yeah, goatee.

278
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,139
I like facial hair.

279
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,059
You like facial hair.

280
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,799
What is it about facial hair on men that you like?

281
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,120
Manly men.

282
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,559
I don't know, there's something, you know, kind of rough about it.

283
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,279
Rough, yeah.

284
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:42,379
Yeah, I don't like the very manicured, very carefully cut facial hair.

285
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:45,039
I kind of like it a little bit more on the rough side.

286
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:45,720
Oh, okay.

287
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:55,200
Um, it's interesting because, uh, it's interesting to see also facial hair on long facial hair.

288
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:57,820
Like, for example, the guys from ZZ Top.

289
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,480
Yeah.

290
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,620
You know, they have like really long beards.

291
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,580
I wonder how long it takes to grow something like this.

292
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,980
I'm sure we could find out on the internet, but, uh, yeah, no, they have competitions.

293
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:12,080
There's a world mustache competition, for example, and they have the world's longest mustache.

294
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,580
And so the man, you know, they measure his mustache.

295
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,340
It's three or four meters or something ridiculous.

296
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,159
Yeah, it can get really long.

297
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,440
Yeah, so I think your hair keeps growing.

298
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,320
It just depends on when you decide to cut it.

299
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,240
I think it's also a very cultural thing, right?

300
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:28,419
Some cultures are able to grow a lot of facial hair and like to do it.

301
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:29,559
Others really don't.

302
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:35,080
For example, you don't really see many Asians with facial hair with goatees or mustaches.

303
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,279
I think you see more goatees than you see full beards actually.

304
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,399
But, uh, yeah, definitely East Asia.

305
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,340
It's not as common.

306
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,460
Although India, you see a lot, a little bit more facial.

307
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,580
A lot of mustaches there.

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,379
Yeah.

309
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:47,559
So this is an interesting question.

310
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:56,560
Tell us how popular it is in your country or if you like men with facial hair or if you're a guy, do you like to have a beard, a mustache or a goatee?

311
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,860
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and we'll see everyone there.

312
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,519
Bye, guys.

313
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:01,840
Bye.
