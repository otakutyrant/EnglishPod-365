00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and today we've got some kids for you in this dialogue.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They're doing something that's very common in America.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm not so sure if it's common elsewhere, but we'll find that out later.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So today we're going to ask for money because we are having a fundraiser.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So this is a very interesting word.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Why don't we take a look at it in vocabulary preview?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So fundraiser is a thing.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's an event.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's something that you do at a school or a business to try and collect money for a special event or charity.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So money, you can also say, is funds, right?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And that's what you're trying to do.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You're trying to collect.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're trying to gather a lot of money or funds in order for, like you say, some sort of objective purpose.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Right.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But it's not just like, we're having a fundraiser to earn more profits this year.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's usually an event that's for some kind of charity or good cause.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So for example, the company is having a fundraiser for Jenny's child because he's sick and they can't pay for medical care.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So a fundraiser is for a good cause.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Exactly.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So that's what this dialogue is all about today.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back in a bit.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay, Mark, it's your turn to ring the doorbell.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I did it last time.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I hate going door to door, and I hate asking for money.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But we need to raise enough money for the school fundraiser so that our class can win the pizza party.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You do want to have a pizza party, don't you?

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, but...

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just go already.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No one's coming.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Try again.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Maybe there's no one home.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Of course there's someone home.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There are two cars in the driveway, and I can see lights on in the house.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hello?

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Anybody home?

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We would like to know if you want to sponsor us in our school fundraiser.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
50% of the profits go towards the new school playground.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know why anyone would want what's in this catalog anyway.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's just a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Cities of old people singing Christmas songs and special crackers and cheeses and boxes of chocolates.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You don't like chocolate?

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Not this kind.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They've got weird names like Ganache and Praline.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Look!

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I just saw someone walking around inside.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
These people are being very rude.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Finally!

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Someone's coming!

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
They don't look too happy.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hi, sir.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Would you like to sponsor us or make a donation to...

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What grade are you kids in?

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Grade 7.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign?

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Can't you read?

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No soliciting?

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thank you.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Alright, so obviously the kids are selling candy and a lot of different things for their new playground.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's the fundraiser, right?

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So they use a lot of interesting words and phrases there.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why don't we take a look at a couple of them on Language Takeaway?

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Language Takeaway.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Well, the first word is one that Marco, you've already talked a little bit about today.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We talked about fundraiser to raise.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, we do have the verb here to raise enough money.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So raise is a verb that means to collect or gather or to get.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So you wouldn't really say we are collecting money or we are gathering money.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You say we are raising money for the victims of the earthquake in Haiti.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's right.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So the reason we don't say we are earning money is because you're not doing any work.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Right.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Really.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're not going to the job at 9 o'clock and leaving the job at 5 o'clock.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're actually asking people for donations.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So that's what you're doing.

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You are raising money.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And now moving on, another way that you can help people maybe through a charity or donation is also to sponsor.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
To sponsor someone or something.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, so people can sponsor events or people and companies can also do this as well.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So to sponsor someone is basically to give them money in support of a cause.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
For example, have you ever done one of those 5K runs or 10K runs?

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Did you have to collect sponsors basically to find people who would help pay money for you to do this run?

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Not personally, but I know people who have, who actually get companies interested.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And maybe that person, for example, is going to run 5K in this race in order to raise money for victims of some serious illness.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And so they get sponsors, they get companies to donate money for this cause.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You could have a person or a company sponsor you that could be your sponsor by giving you money that you can then use for this charity or special cause.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's right.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But the difference between a fundraiser and to sponsor something or someone is that sponsoring is not always for a charity or for some sort of nonprofit cause, right?

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We have many sponsors for concerts or for sporting events.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's right.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So oftentimes when you see athletes, they have their sponsors or their sponsors' logos written all over their jerseys, the clothes that they wear.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So for example, if you're watching Formula One racing, you see the Ferrari and the bank emblems and all these different things.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's right.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So those are different ways of sponsoring events or people.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And now moving on, we have a word that's, well, not really related to money and fundraisers, but it's a very interesting word and very common.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
When the kids mentioned that they're selling a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Tacky.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Tacky.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
OK, you're going to hear this a lot.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And the interesting thing about the word tacky is that it means something different to everyone.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So what I think is tacky might be just normal for Marco.

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And what Marco thinks is really tacky might be something that I actually like.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And so tacky is basically a bad thing.

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It means something is not good looking or not very, not very fashionable, fashionable.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's like in bad taste.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But as you say, taste is something subjective, right?

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So maybe, for example.

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Sometimes we say that when girls wear too much makeup, it's very tacky, right?

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Right.

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Red lipstick and blue eyeshadow.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Exactly.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So a guy might say, oh, that's so tacky, whereas another person might not think it's tacky at all.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So this happens a lot.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And we use this word a lot with decorations, for example, for someone's house.

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You may describe it as tacky or a restaurant or a bar.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Right.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So for maybe sometimes those Italian restaurants that have the red and white checkered table claws and other pictures of the Italians with the mustaches, I might think that's a little bit tacky.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But maybe you think it's cute.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Right.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So something that's tacky.

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And as we say, people use it all the time.

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And it's not necessarily a bad thing.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You can just say, oh, it's a little bit tacky or I think this thing is a little bit tacky.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And that's it, right?

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Solicit.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Solicit.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And our final word on language takeaway towards the end of the dialogue, when the kids were reading the sign, the sign said, no soliciting.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And they didn't understand what that means.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What does it mean when you have a sign that says no soliciting?

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So to solicit is to try to sell something or to offer a service.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So basically the sign means please don't come to my house and sell me stuff.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
For example, we have door to door insurance salesmen or makeup salespeople and these people go to your door and they try to sell you their product.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And no soliciting means don't come to my house.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm not going to answer the door if you're trying to sell something.

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So to solicit is to try and sell something.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But usually in person trying to make a sale uninvited, right?

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because if you're a businessman and you have a meeting, a sales meeting, you're not really soliciting with that other person.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No, this is basically trying to sell something to a stranger.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Exactly.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay.

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Very good.

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So a lot of interesting words there.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back shortly with Fluency Builder.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, Mark, it's your turn to ring the doorbell.

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I did it last time.

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I hate going door to door and I hate asking for money.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But we need to raise enough money for the school fundraiser so that our class can win the pizza party.

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You do want to have a pizza party, don't you?

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes, but...

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Just go already.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No one's coming.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Try again.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Maybe there's no one home.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Of course there's someone home.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There are two cars in the driveway and I can see lights on in the house.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hello?

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Anybody home?

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We would like to know if you want to sponsor us in our school fundraiser.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
50% of the profits go towards the new school playground.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't know why anyone would want what's in this catalog anyway.

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's just a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Cities of old people singing Christmas songs and special crackers and cheeses and boxes of chocolates.

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You don't like chocolate?

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Not this kind.

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
They've got weird names like Ganache and Praline.

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Look, I just saw someone walking around inside.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
These people are being very rude.

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Finally, someone's coming.

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
They don't look too happy.

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hi, sir.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Would you like to sponsor us or make a donation to...

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What grade are you kids in?

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Grade seven.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign?

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Can't you read?

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No soliciting?

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
All right, so now we're back and we have four key phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay, this first phrase is a pretty common one.

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We wanted to make sure that everyone was comfortable with the verb that goes with doorbell.

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So Marco, what do you do to a doorbell?

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You ring the doorbell.

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You ring the doorbell.

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So you don't touch it, you don't press it.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You can press it, but you ring the doorbell.

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's the verb.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay, so for example, when I was a little, my brother and I always used to fight about who could ring the doorbell.

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Really?

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes.

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I loved ringing the doorbell and so did he.

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Do you do the long ring or do you do the...

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You do it like that.

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The annoying ring.

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, so to ring the doorbell.

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
All right, all right, and well going back, when we were talking about no soliciting, you said that salespeople go door to door selling things.

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So this is an interesting phrase and it's a fixed phrase, going door to door.

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, think about it.

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So a salesperson who wants to sell maybe some makeup goes to one house and no one wants to buy any makeup there, so she goes to the next house.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So she's going from house to house, but we don't really say house to house because she's going to your door to offer the makeup.

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So we just say going door to door.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That means going to strangers' homes in order, one door after the next, to sell something.

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Very good.

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You go door to door.

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So for example, someone can go door to door asking for some sugar.

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's right.

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Or we could say he is a door to door salesman.

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Door to door salesman, very good.

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
All right, and now we have an interesting question and it's a very good one because it's a question that comes up a lot.

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
When somebody asks you, if you're studying, for example, what grade are you in?

219
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay, what grade are you in?

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So in the American system, for example, we have the very, very bottom grade K, which is kindergarten for maybe a five-year-old, and at the very top we have high school grade 12.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And so in between we have one, two, three, four, five, and up.

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And so basically to find out what year in school a student is, you have to ask him or her, what grade are you in?

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Right.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So then the person would say, I'm in sixth grade, I'm in eighth grade.

225
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But this is the way you ask this question for a school, as you said, a kid that's maybe five years old all the way to 18 years old in high school.

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What grade are you in?

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Now if you're in university and you want to ask your friend what year of university that person's in, then you say, what year are you?

228
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What year are you?

229
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, you don't say grade.

230
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So basically grade refers to like what you said, Marco, those first 12 years of school.

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And so we call them, we thought, no, we don't call them grade 12.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So you could ask anybody under the age of 18, what grade are you in?

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But when you go to university or when you're talking about university students, it gets a little bit different.

234
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So you can say, what year are you in or what year are you?

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So if you're not sure about someone's age and you maybe think they're in college, you can ask them, what year are you?

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But generally, anyone under 18, what grade are you in?

237
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay, good.

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
All right.

239
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And our last phrase, and this is kind of an expression, right?

240
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Goodness sake.

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
For goodness sake.

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay, so let's look at the context.

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The kids say, we're in grade seven.

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And the person at the door says, then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign?

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Right, for goodness sake.

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So this is an expression that's used to indicate maybe you're a little bit frustrated.

247
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes.

248
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Right?

249
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So it's like, come on, or my goodness, or for Pete's sake.

250
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So we have many ways of saying, all right, come on, I'm a little tired of this.

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're irritating me.

252
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Right.

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So basically the person's saying, you are too old for this.

254
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You're too old for this.

255
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You should read what it says on my door.

256
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No soliciting.

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Right.

258
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And so the person's angry.

259
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Right.

260
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The person's angry because these kids are trying to sell her something, when clearly she has a sign that says, no soliciting.

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's right.

262
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay.

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
A lot of interesting phrases there.

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue for the very last time, and we'll be back to talk with you a little bit more.

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay, Mark, it's your turn to ring the doorbell.

266
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I did it last time.

267
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I hate going door to door and I hate asking for money.

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But we need to raise enough money for the school fundraiser so that our class can win the pizza party.

269
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You do want to have a pizza party, don't you?

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes, but...

271
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Just go already.

272
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No one's coming.

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Try again.

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Maybe there's no one home.

275
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Of course there's someone home.

276
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There are two cars in the driveway and I can see lights on in the house.

277
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hello?

278
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Anybody home?

279
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We would like to know if you want to sponsor us in our school fundraiser.

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Fifty percent of the profits go towards the new school playground.

281
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't know why anyone would want what's in this catalogue anyway.

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's just a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments.

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Cities of old people singing Christmas songs and special crackers and cheeses and boxes of chocolates.

284
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You don't like chocolate?

285
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Not this kind.

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
They've got weird names like Ganache and Praline.

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Look, I just saw someone walking around inside.

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
These people are being very rude.

289
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Finally!

290
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Someone's coming.

291
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
They don't look too happy.

292
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Hi, sir.

293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Would you like to sponsor us or make a donation to...

294
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What grade are you kids in?

295
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Grade seven.

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign?

297
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Can't you read?

298
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No soliciting?

299
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Alright, so door-to-door salesman.

300
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I think this used to be a very American thing.

301
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think back in the 50s you would always see movies where this was actually a profession.

302
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's right.

303
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
People would go door-to-door selling hairbrushes or magazine subscriptions.

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Pretty much everything.

305
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, you still see it sometimes.

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Some people sell insurance or there are a lot of religious door-to-door salespeople who want to sell religious books or magazines.

307
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But I think it was much more popular in the 1950s because people didn't really use their phones as much to sell things.

308
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It was cheaper to have someone drive his car to your neighborhood and then go to every single house.

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But yeah, it's a very interesting job.

310
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I think it would be very lonely.

311
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And also I think, well, now maybe that's been reduced a lot because now you have the internet.

312
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh yeah, well the internet means that the salespeople come to you without you having to get up.

313
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So basically you're sitting at home in your pajamas and you can order a TV and some clothes.

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But it's very interesting because I remember you would have all these door-to-door sales.

315
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
For example, I had one visit me once who was selling me encyclopedias.

316
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Really?

317
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
A big collection of, I don't know, 37 books or more.

318
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It was a huge amount of books, encyclopedias.

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And I don't know if you see that anymore.

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Not really, not in the States.

321
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't know if anyone buys physical huge encyclopedias to have in their home.

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
No, only collectors perhaps.

323
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Maybe.

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So it's a very interesting profession.

325
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't know, in the United States, as you say, it's not very common anymore, very little.

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Maybe specific services.

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But this is interesting.

328
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Maybe in your country this is still a big thing.

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah, let us know.

330
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
In your country are door-to-door salespeople still common?

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Do you see them?

332
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

333
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We hope to see you there.

334
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,000
All right, bye-bye.

335
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Bye.
