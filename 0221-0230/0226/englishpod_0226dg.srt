00:00:01,539 --> 00:00:08,140
EnglishPod.com Okay Mark, it's your turn to ring the doorbell.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,439
I did it last time.

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,800
I hate going door to door and I hate asking for money.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,539
But we need to raise enough money for the school fundraiser so that our class can win the pizza party.

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,980
You do want to have a pizza party, don't you?

6
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:21,660
Yes, but...

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,739
Just go already.

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,519
No one's coming.

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,480
Try again.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,120
Maybe there's no one home.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,699
Of course there's someone home.

12
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:32,960
There are two cars in the driveway and I can see lights on in the house.

13
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:34,840
Hello?

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,119
Anybody home?

15
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:39,679
We would like to know if you want to sponsor us in our school fundraiser.

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,100
50% of the profits go towards the new school playground.

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,979
I don't know why anyone would want what's in this catalogue anyway.

18
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:49,320
It's just a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments.

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,539
CDs of old people singing Christmas songs and special crackers and cheeses and boxes of chocolates.

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,619
You don't like chocolate?

21
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:57,939
Not this kind.

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,460
They've got weird names like Ganache and Praline.

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,060
Look, I just saw someone walking around inside.

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,959
These people are being very rude.

25
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,260
Finally, someone's coming.

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,099
They don't look too happy.

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,959
Hi sir, would you like to sponsor us or make a donation to...

28
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,239
What grade are you kids in?

29
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:16,140
Grade 7.

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,939
Then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign?

31
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,319
Can't you read?

32
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:22,019
No soliciting?
