00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com Okay Mark, it's your turn to ring the doorbell.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I did it last time.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I hate going door to door and I hate asking for money.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But we need to raise enough money for the school fundraiser so that our class can win the pizza party.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You do want to have a pizza party, don't you?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes, but...

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Just go already.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No one's coming.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Try again.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Maybe there's no one home.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Of course there's someone home.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There are two cars in the driveway and I can see lights on in the house.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Anybody home?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We would like to know if you want to sponsor us in our school fundraiser.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
50% of the profits go towards the new school playground.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't know why anyone would want what's in this catalogue anyway.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's just a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
CDs of old people singing Christmas songs and special crackers and cheeses and boxes of chocolates.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You don't like chocolate?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Not this kind.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
They've got weird names like Ganache and Praline.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Look, I just saw someone walking around inside.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
These people are being very rude.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Finally, someone's coming.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They don't look too happy.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hi sir, would you like to sponsor us or make a donation to...

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What grade are you kids in?

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Grade 7.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign?

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Can't you read?

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No soliciting?
