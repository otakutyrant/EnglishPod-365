EnglishPod.com What do you want based on the genre, title, or if you know the author, I can point you towards the right direction.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That would be in our children's section, that bookshelf there on the right.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, I would like to check out these books.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do you have a library card?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, how do I get one?

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I just need to see a driver's license or a utility bill to prove that you are a resident of this state.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Here you go.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So, you're all set.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You can have these books for two weeks.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you need to have them longer, you can bring them here to renew them.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you don't, you get charged ten cents a day for each book.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, thanks.
