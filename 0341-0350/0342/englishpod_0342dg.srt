EnglishPod.com What do you want based on the genre, title, or if you know the author, I can point you towards the right direction.

2
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,479
I'm looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.

3
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,200
That would be in our children's section, that bookshelf there on the right.

4
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:52,539
Okay, I would like to check out these books.

5
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,740
Do you have a library card?

6
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,659
No, how do I get one?

7
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:01,960
I just need to see a driver's license or a utility bill to prove that you are a resident of this state.

8
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:03,039
Here you go.

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,079
So, you're all set.

10
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,959
You can have these books for two weeks.

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,280
If you need to have them longer, you can bring them here to renew them.

12
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,159
If you don't, you get charged ten cents a day for each book.

13
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:14,299
Okay, thanks.
