00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and we're in the mood to read something today, so we're going to a place called the library, right?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're going to go to the library, and we're going to get some books.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But before we do that, let's take a look at a word in vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All right.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So today's vocabulary preview word is a thing that you use when you go to the library to take that book home.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You don't have to pay for the book.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You use your library card to borrow it.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's right.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So this is something that you need when you want to get books at the library.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You need a library card.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So we're going to talk about this and how you get a library card.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So let's listen to the dialogue.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Wow, look at all these books.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I bet I can find a book about anything here.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Shh, please keep your voice down.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There are people reading and studying here.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Are you the librarian?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Maybe you can help me.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am looking for a book.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, I am.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can check our online catalog to search for the book you want based on the genre, title, or if you know the author, I can point you towards the right direction.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That would be in our children's section.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And that bookshelf there on the right.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay, I would like to check out these books.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Do you have a library card?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No, how do I get one?

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I just need to see a driver's license or utility bill to prove that you are a resident of this state.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Here you go.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So, you're all set.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You can have these books for two weeks.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you need to have them longer, you can bring them here to renew them.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you don't, you get charged 10 cents a day for each book.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, thanks.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All right, we're back.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So, now let's start with Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
All right, we have a lot of great things for you today in Language Takeaway.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The first is actually a job.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is a person who works at a library.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What's that person called?

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He or she is called a librarian.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All right, so someone who works at a library is a librarian.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's right.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So, this person organizes the books, knows about all the books that are there, and basically takes care of the library.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's right.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, if you need help in the library, it's probably a good idea to ask the librarian where the book you're looking for is.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And today we went in looking for a specific type of book.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We wanted a book that had nursery rhymes.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
All right, nursery rhymes.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now, these are kind of like songs or poems, things that we tell little children and babies.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So, Mary had a little lamb, little lamb.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That is a nursery rhyme.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's a playful poem for children.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's right.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So, obviously, since we are looking for nursery rhyme books, the librarian told us that we need to go to the children's section.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But before we get to borrow this book, there are a couple of things we need because the person doesn't have a library card.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now, the question is, how do I get a library card?

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What was the librarian's response, Marco?

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, it was pretty simple.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
All we needed was to see that person's driver's license or a utility bill.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
All right.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So, a driver's license is an ID card, an identification card that you get that allows you to drive a car.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now, each state has a different kind of driver's license and different rules for how to get one.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But this is a very common, almost the most common kind of identification in America.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's right.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, basically, you show them your driver's license, and it has a picture of you there, your telephone number, and even your address.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's right.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But not everybody has a driver's license.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Some people don't drive, some people can't drive, some people don't want to drive.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So, they would have to show something else, and a good way to show that you live somewhere is to show your utility bill.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's right.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And so, a utility is basically water, electricity, gas, or your telephone bill, and it arrives to your house, and that's where it's, well, obviously it says your address there and who the bill is directed to, so you can prove that you live there.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's right, because why would somebody else pay for the water at that house?

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's obviously you, so these are a couple kinds of identification you can use to get a library card.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
All right.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And while we're taking the books, we can borrow them for two weeks, but if we need to have them for a longer period of time, we can take them back to the library and have them renewed.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So to renew something, re-new, means to continue to borrow it.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You have to re-borrow, but we don't say re-borrow, we say re-new, so that means we get it for another two weeks.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's right.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So things that expire, usually you need to re-new, like for example, your driver's license, usually it will last maybe five years, but then you need to re-new your driver's license.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And if you don't re-new it, if you forget to re-new something, maybe there'll be a problem like in the case of the library, you have to pay for the late fees.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Your book is over-due, you have to pay for it.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Or in the case of a driver's license, if your driver's license is over-due, well, you probably have to get a new one.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's right.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, so a lot of vocab there, why don't we review everything, and we'll be right back.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Hey, I am looking for a book.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes, I am.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You can check our online catalog to search for the book you want based on the genre, title, or if you know the author, I can point you towards the right direction.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That would be in our children's section, that bookshelf there on the right.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay, I would like to check out these books.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you have a library card?

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No, how do I get one?

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I just need to see a driver's license or a utility bill to prove that you are a resident of this state.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Here you go.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So you're all set.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can have these books for two weeks.

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If you need to have them longer, you can bring them here to re-new them.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If you don't, you get charged 10 cents a day for each book.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, thanks.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
All right, so now we have three key phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So Marco, what are librarians famous for?

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, librarians are always telling you to please keep your voice down.

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
All right, so libraries are quiet places.

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They're places where people like to go and read and think and study.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So oftentimes when people are talking, they're being loud, the librarian will say, hey, keep your voice down or be quiet.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's right.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So another way of saying be quiet is keep your voice down.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And it's a little bit more polite.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Please keep your voice down.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Keep your voice down.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Or if there's two people or three people, you'd say, keep your voices down.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So the librarian tells us to keep our voice down.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And well, now we can get some help from the librarian.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And he says that, you know, if you know the title of the book or the genre or the name of the author, the librarian can point you towards the right direction.

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Now to point someone in the right direction or point someone towards the right direction means to help them understand where to go.

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Maybe they don't know exactly the title of the book or the author, but in this case, the librarian can help put the person in the right place.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So I can point you in the right direction or point you towards the right direction.

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Exactly.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Even maybe you're lost in a town and you stop and ask someone for directions because you don't know how to get there and that person can help you by pointing you towards the right direction.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
All right.

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So this means I can help you basically.

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay.

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And now what we what we wanted to do was we wanted to borrow books from the library.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We wanted to get books from the library, but we have another way of saying this.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We can say we want to check out some books.

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
All right.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So to check out a book means to borrow it, like you say, but this is also a noun, check out.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's the place where you scan something.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So maybe there's a bar, a black bar on the back of the book, beep, when you scan it, it scans out.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That means that you're borrowing it, you get it for two weeks, and you bring it back to check out.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So a lot of great stuff in this dialogue today, learning about libraries and how to get a library card.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why don't we review everything one last time?

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Wow.

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Look at all these books.

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I bet I can find a book about anything here.

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Please keep your voice down.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There are people reading and studying here.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Are you the librarian?

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Maybe you can help me.

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I am looking for a book.

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes, I am.

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You can check our online catalog to search for the book you want based on the genre title, or if you know the author, I can point you towards the right direction.

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That would be in our children's section, that bookshelf there on the right.

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I would like to check out these books.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Do you have a library card?

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
No.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
How do I get one?

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I just need to see your driver's license or utility bill to prove that you are a resident of this state.

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Here you go.

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So, you're all set.

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can have these books for two weeks.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If you need to have them longer, you can bring them here to renew them.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If you don't, you get charged 10 cents a day for each book.

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Thanks.

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
All right, so borrowing books in a library seems pretty simple, and you don't really have to leave a deposit or something just in case you steal the book or you damage it.

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
How do you deal with this?

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
No.

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, libraries are a wonderful part of, well, at least American culture.

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm not really sure how they work in other places, but in America, there's a lot of federal money in libraries.

173
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
In fact, I think it was Franklin Roosevelt who really helps get a library system in place in America.

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So, they're a part of this system of kind of community sharing and information.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You can go to the library and look for jobs.

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
They have computers.

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Many have DVD and video sections.

178
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Many have very wonderful CD sections.

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So basically, it's a community center for information, knowledge, and it's almost a relationship of trust.

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I trust that the library will provide for me, and the library will trust that I don't destroy a book.

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Of course, if you do, you have to pay.

182
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You have to pay.

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So is it a federal offense to steal a book from a library?

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't know.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But it's a pretty big deal to steal a book from the library.

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They certainly will know who you are because they have your information, your driver's license.

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay, so it's actually pretty interesting, especially because, as you said, libraries, there's a lot of money put into libraries.

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
All communities have them, as you say, DVDs or movies or a lot of different types of books.

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
In other countries, like maybe in Latin America, it's not as popular to have a community library where you can go and check things out because there's not that much money involved as well.

190
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But we would be curious to know how it works in your country.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Maybe your country has some beautiful or extensive libraries.

192
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, I'm very curious as well.

193
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So public libraries do have them, and if you don't, do you also have university libraries you can go to?

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Let us know.

195
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
All right, guys.

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We'll see you there.

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Bye.

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Bye.

200
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Bye.
