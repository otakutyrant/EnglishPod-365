00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,719
Hello there, welcome to Wine World.

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,939
Let me know if I can help you out at all.

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,380
Um, yes, please.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,580
I could really use some help.

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,620
I'm going over to my boss's house for dinner tonight and I don't know what kind of wine I should bring.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,300
Okay.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,660
Do you know what kind of food will be served?

8
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:22,420
Well, his wife is Japanese.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,440
He said she makes really good sushi.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,760
That's a bit of a challenge.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,359
Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.

12
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,159
Well, let's see.

13
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:36,820
It'll have to be a white wine, of course.

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:37,719
Why?

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,219
Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?

16
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,719
No, I don't think so.

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,920
Sushi is a very delicately flavored food and red wine would be a jarring contrast.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,280
You need a white wine which has more subtle flavors to complement the fish.

19
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:52,539
I see.

20
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,299
So I should get a bottle of Chardonnay.

21
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,359
That's a white wine, right?

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,619
Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet.

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,579
Chardonnay is one of the more full-bodied whites and tends to be a bit oaky.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,040
I'd suggest you go for something brighter like the Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,560
Oh, the Sauvignon Blanc?

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,439
What's that?

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,379
That's another varietal or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,200
Let's see.

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:27,500
The label says it's got attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp mineral flavors and a bone-dry finish, served chilled.

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,219
Oh no, how long will it take to chill the wine?

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,859
I'm on my way to dinner now.

32
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,680
Oh, it's okay.

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,219
Don't worry.

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,340
We'll just choose a wine from the cooler.

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,799
We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.

36
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:44,739
All right, what varietal is that?

37
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label.

38
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:56,719
The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine.

39
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:03,319
This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.

40
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,000
And do you think this is a good wine?

41
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,939
Yes, this is one of our best sellers.

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,199
It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable.

43
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,539
It's light and crisp with a bit of a vanilla aroma.

44
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:17,300
Perfect.

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,520
I'll take it.
