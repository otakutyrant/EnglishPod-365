00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello there, welcome to Wine World.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let me know if I can help you out at all.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Um, yes, please.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I could really use some help.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm going over to my boss's house for dinner tonight and I don't know what kind of wine I should bring.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Do you know what kind of food will be served?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, his wife is Japanese.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He said she makes really good sushi.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's a bit of a challenge.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, let's see.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It'll have to be a white wine, of course.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Why?

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No, I don't think so.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Sushi is a very delicately flavored food and red wine would be a jarring contrast.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You need a white wine which has more subtle flavors to complement the fish.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I see.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So I should get a bottle of Chardonnay.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's a white wine, right?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Chardonnay is one of the more full-bodied whites and tends to be a bit oaky.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'd suggest you go for something brighter like the Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, the Sauvignon Blanc?

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What's that?

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's another varietal or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's see.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The label says it's got attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp mineral flavors and a bone-dry finish, served chilled.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh no, how long will it take to chill the wine?

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm on my way to dinner now.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, it's okay.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't worry.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We'll just choose a wine from the cooler.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
All right, what varietal is that?

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And do you think this is a good wine?

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, this is one of our best sellers.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's light and crisp with a bit of a vanilla aroma.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Perfect.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll take it.
