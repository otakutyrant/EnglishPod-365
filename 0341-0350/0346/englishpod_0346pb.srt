00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Katherine, and we're going to be purchasing some wine today, right, Marco?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today we're going to go to the shop and we're going to try to look for some wine that will go well with the type of food that we're having.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
All right.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So we're going to be learning a lot of specific terms.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is an advanced lesson, so we expect that most of the basics you already know, but some of these more difficult words and phrases are going to be our focus.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello there.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome to Wine World.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let me know if I can help you out at all.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Um, yes, please.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I could really use some help.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going over to my boss's house for dinner tonight, and I don't know what kind of wine I should bring.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Uh, do you know what kind of food will be served?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, his wife is Japanese.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
He said she makes really good sushi.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hmm.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's a bit of a challenge.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, let's see.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It'll have to be a white wine, of course.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why?

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, I don't think so.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors to complement the fish.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I see.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So I should get a bottle of Chardonnay.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's a white wine, right?

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Chardonnay is one of the more full-bodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'd suggest you go for something brighter, like the Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, the Sauvignon Blanc?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What's that?

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's see.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The label says it's got attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp mineral flavors and a bone-dry finish, served chilled.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh no, how long will it take to chill the wine?

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm on my way to dinner now.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, it's okay.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't worry.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We'll just choose a wine from the cooler.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Alright, what varietal is that?

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And do you think this is a good wine?

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, this is one of our best sellers.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Perfect.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll take it.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Alright, we're back.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So now we're talking about wines, and one of the first things that really pop up is when we're talking about sushi and how we're trying to get a wine to go well with sushi.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Alright, so the phrase here was to pair with wine.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Alright, so when you talk about wine, you talk about pairing it with food, P-A-I-R, to pair.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's right.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So for example, if you're having meat, or poultry, or chicken, you try to pair it with a wine so basically that the flavors go well together.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So commonly we say that red wine pairs well with red meat, or fish and white wine pair well together.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So you're pairing these two things means you're using them in the same meal.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's right.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So when we were talking about pairing a wine with sushi, the girl said, well what about red wine?

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Wouldn't that pair well with sushi?

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And the attendant said, no.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The red wine would be a jarring contrast.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So first of all we have this word jarring.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Something is jarring if it's loud, shocking, abrasive, difficult, annoying.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So something that's jarring is loud.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And a contrast is something that shows the differences in something.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's right.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So when we're saying that it would be a jarring contrast to have sushi with red wine, we're saying that they're just too different.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Sushi is too different from the red wine flavor, so they wouldn't go well together.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's right.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And since jarring means it's a bad thing, we think the flavor will be wrong.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It'll be bad.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So we need to look for something else.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And the salesperson suggested a wine that has more subtle flavors, white wine.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's right.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So this word subtle is actually spelled S-U-B-T-L-E, but the B is silent.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's right.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So we say subtle.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And it's actually great because it's kind of like the opposite of jarring.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Something that's not jarring is subtle.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Right.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So it's a little bit more, I don't know, like relaxed, like not as loud.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's not obvious.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You have to really think about it and look for it.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Something that's subtle is not obvious.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's right.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Now talking about one specific type of white wine, we have a Chardonnay.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
All right.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So we know that there are many, many different kinds of wine out there, but there are some very common ones and Chardonnay is one of those.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I think Chardonnay tends to be a bit fruitier.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Australia has some famous Chardonnays.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
California has some famous Chardonnays.

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So just remember that Chardonnay is a kind of white wine.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's right.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And one of the ways that they used it to describe Chardonnay is that it's one of the more full bodied whites.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
All right.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So whites here, we're talking about white wines, but something that's full bodied.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What does that mean, Marco?

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So if a wine is full bodied, it means that it has a little bit of a stronger flavor, like it's a more complete flavor.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not as subtle.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
All right.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So we know that white wines are a bit more subtle than red wines in this case, but within white wines, you can have one that's very full bodied.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So this is a great phrase for describing wine.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We don't really talk about other things being full bodied, but wine can be full bodied if it really has what you say, Marco, this big full taste, a great taste.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's right.

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And actually the sales attendant suggested that, well, since the Chardonnay is more full bodied, then he would recommend maybe a Sauvignon Blanc.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All right.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So Sauvignon Blanc, Blanc is the French word for white, but we use this all the time in English.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Sauvignon Blanc being the kind of wine.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Again, it's a white wine and it's a bit brighter than the Chardonnay.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's what the salesperson said.

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's right.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And when we're talking about wines, either red wines or white wines, this the way to describe it or the different varieties is actually a varietal of the wines or the type of grape.

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Right.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So varietal.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So you think of variety, varietal.

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Varietal is a specific wine word that we use to describe the kind of grape that go into a wine.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So we know wine generally comes from grapes.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
They're crushed down and then the alcohol comes from all the sugars.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But each different kind of grape has a different flavor and that's the varietal, the kind of grape.

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's right.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So just think of it as the variety of the wines that you have and it's words used specifically for wines.

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And well, when the attendant kept talking about the wines and the types of wines they have there, he mentioned that they have a small selection in the refrigerator or in the cooler.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So selection in this case means what the store has to offer.

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It means all the wines that they sell.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So maybe if you have an extensive selection, it means you have many, many, many different kinds to choose from.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But if you don't have an extensive selection, you have very few wines, that means that you have fewer things to sell.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's right.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So a wide selection of wines or a small selection of wines.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And lastly, talking about varietals, we also have what we call a blend, a blend of a few different types of grapes.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
All right, so you can have blends of different things, but in terms of wine, we're talking about using different grapes together to make one wine.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
All right, so this is something that's pretty common and it's a way to achieve different flavors.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's right.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So a blend, you also talk about it in, I think, whiskies.

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You have a blended whiskies.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's right.

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So you can have a single malt, which is one grain in one barrel, or you can have a blend, which would be different grains fermented in different barrels mixed together later.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay.

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So a lot of great stuff here all about wines.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hello there, welcome to Wine World.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let me know if I can help you out at all.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes, please.

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I could really use some help.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm going over to my boss's house for dinner tonight and I don't know what kind of wine I should bring.

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Uh, do you know what kind of food will be served?

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Well, his wife is Japanese.

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He said she makes really good sushi.

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hmm.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's a bit of a challenge.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, let's see.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It'll have to be a white wine, of course.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why?

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No, I don't think so.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Sushi is a very delicately flavored food and red wine would be a jarring contrast.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors to compliment the fish.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I see.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So I should get a bottle of Chardonnay.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's a white wine, right?

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Chardonnay is one of the more full-bodied whites and tends to be a bit oaky.

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'd suggest you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, the Sauvignon Blanc?

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What's that?

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let's see.

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The label says it's got attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp mineral flavors and a bone-dry finish.

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Served chilled.

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, no.

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
How long will it take to chill the wine?

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm on my way to dinner now.

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, it's okay.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't worry.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We'll just choose a wine from the cooler.

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but this Rhone Valley White would be lovely.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
All right.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What varietal is that?

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label.

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine.

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And do you think this is a good wine?

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes.

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This is one of our best sellers.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's light and crisp with a bit of a vanilla aroma.

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Perfect.

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll take it.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
All right, so obviously there are a lot more varietals out there.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We only talked about two types of wines.

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We had a Chardonnay and a Sauvignon Blanc.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's right.

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And the only wines we talked about were white wines.

205
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Of course, there's a whole world of red wines out there.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And then between red and white, you have rosé, which are those pink wines.

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Those pink wines, yeah.

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But actually, it's interesting because the culture of drinking wine is not as extensive as we think it is.

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
In many parts of the world, they're not really used to drinking wine.

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's right.

211
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But then you go to places like France and Italy and South America, like Argentina, Chile, and you experience these different cultures of wine that are, I think, quite interesting because they're so different.

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, that's right.

213
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And it's become even healthy to drink wine.

214
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Medical tests show that if you have one glass of wine with dinner every day, it reduces your chances of heart disease.

215
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's right.

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
There's some special ingredient.

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm not sure what it is, but obviously you don't want to drink too much.

218
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But if you have a little bit, it's good for your heart.

219
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think red wine, they say, is good for your heart.

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So it's interesting, but obviously maybe in your countries you don't drink wine, or maybe you have a particular type of wine, like in China they have, isn't it, plum wine or rice wine.

221
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Rice wine in China and plum wine, I think, in Japan.

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
In Japan.

223
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So maybe you have a specific type of wine that you want to let us know about, and of course if you have any questions or comments, we're always there.

224
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
All right, we'll see you again.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Bye.
