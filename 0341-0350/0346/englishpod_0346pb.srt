00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,319
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,019
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:08,679
My name is Katherine, and we're going to be purchasing some wine today, right, Marco?

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,339
That's right.

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:15,699
Today we're going to go to the shop and we're going to try to look for some wine that will go well with the type of food that we're having.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,219
All right.

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,820
So we're going to be learning a lot of specific terms.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:28,059
This is an advanced lesson, so we expect that most of the basics you already know, but some of these more difficult words and phrases are going to be our focus.

9
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:30,120
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,820
Hello there.

11
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,840
Welcome to Wine World.

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,060
Let me know if I can help you out at all.

13
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,520
Um, yes, please.

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,719
I could really use some help.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,759
I'm going over to my boss's house for dinner tonight, and I don't know what kind of wine I should bring.

16
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,439
Okay.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,780
Uh, do you know what kind of food will be served?

18
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,560
Well, his wife is Japanese.

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,600
He said she makes really good sushi.

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:54,799
Hmm.

21
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,899
That's a bit of a challenge.

22
00:00:57,419 --> 00:01:00,500
Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.

23
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,299
Well, let's see.

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,939
It'll have to be a white wine, of course.

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,840
Why?

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,359
Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?

27
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,859
No, I don't think so.

28
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:16,060
Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast.

29
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,420
You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors to complement the fish.

30
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:21,680
I see.

31
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:23,420
So I should get a bottle of Chardonnay.

32
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,500
That's a white wine, right?

33
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,760
Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet.

34
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,719
Chardonnay is one of the more full-bodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky.

35
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,180
I'd suggest you go for something brighter, like the Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,700
Oh, the Sauvignon Blanc?

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,560
What's that?

38
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,519
That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

39
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,340
Let's see.

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:56,620
The label says it's got attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp mineral flavors and a bone-dry finish, served chilled.

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,359
Oh no, how long will it take to chill the wine?

42
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,980
I'm on my way to dinner now.

43
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,819
Oh, it's okay.

44
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:02,359
Don't worry.

45
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,480
We'll just choose a wine from the cooler.

46
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:11,939
We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.

47
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,879
Alright, what varietal is that?

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,139
Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label.

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,860
The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine.

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,439
This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.

51
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,139
And do you think this is a good wine?

52
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,080
Yes, this is one of our best sellers.

53
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:42,340
It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable.

54
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,659
It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.

55
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:46,439
Perfect.

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,639
I'll take it.

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,740
Alright, we're back.

58
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:02,180
So now we're talking about wines, and one of the first things that really pop up is when we're talking about sushi and how we're trying to get a wine to go well with sushi.

59
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,759
Alright, so the phrase here was to pair with wine.

60
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:09,460
So sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.

61
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:16,520
Alright, so when you talk about wine, you talk about pairing it with food, P-A-I-R, to pair.

62
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:17,680
That's right.

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:26,919
So for example, if you're having meat, or poultry, or chicken, you try to pair it with a wine so basically that the flavors go well together.

64
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:35,719
So commonly we say that red wine pairs well with red meat, or fish and white wine pair well together.

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,379
So you're pairing these two things means you're using them in the same meal.

66
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:41,400
That's right.

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay.

68
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,860
So when we were talking about pairing a wine with sushi, the girl said, well what about red wine?

69
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,319
Wouldn't that pair well with sushi?

70
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,300
And the attendant said, no.

71
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,520
The red wine would be a jarring contrast.

72
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,599
So first of all we have this word jarring.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,080
Something is jarring if it's loud, shocking, abrasive, difficult, annoying.

74
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,120
So something that's jarring is loud.

75
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,020
And a contrast is something that shows the differences in something.

76
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,680
That's right.

77
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:18,240
So when we're saying that it would be a jarring contrast to have sushi with red wine, we're saying that they're just too different.

78
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,139
Sushi is too different from the red wine flavor, so they wouldn't go well together.

79
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,540
That's right.

80
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,920
And since jarring means it's a bad thing, we think the flavor will be wrong.

81
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,779
It'll be bad.

82
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,740
So we need to look for something else.

83
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,439
And the salesperson suggested a wine that has more subtle flavors, white wine.

84
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,420
That's right.

85
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,480
So this word subtle is actually spelled S-U-B-T-L-E, but the B is silent.

86
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,259
That's right.

87
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,660
So we say subtle.

88
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,480
And it's actually great because it's kind of like the opposite of jarring.

89
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,620
Something that's not jarring is subtle.

90
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,120
Right.

91
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:58,879
So it's a little bit more, I don't know, like relaxed, like not as loud.

92
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,180
It's not obvious.

93
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,279
You have to really think about it and look for it.

94
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,300
Something that's subtle is not obvious.

95
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,079
That's right.

96
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:11,180
Now talking about one specific type of white wine, we have a Chardonnay.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,279
All right.

98
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,699
So we know that there are many, many different kinds of wine out there, but there are some very common ones and Chardonnay is one of those.

99
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,300
I think Chardonnay tends to be a bit fruitier.

100
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,420
Australia has some famous Chardonnays.

101
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:27,560
California has some famous Chardonnays.

102
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,339
So just remember that Chardonnay is a kind of white wine.

103
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,060
That's right.

104
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:38,300
And one of the ways that they used it to describe Chardonnay is that it's one of the more full bodied whites.

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,160
All right.

106
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,920
So whites here, we're talking about white wines, but something that's full bodied.

107
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,959
What does that mean, Marco?

108
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:51,620
So if a wine is full bodied, it means that it has a little bit of a stronger flavor, like it's a more complete flavor.

109
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,620
It's not as subtle.

110
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:53,240
All right.

111
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:02,459
So we know that white wines are a bit more subtle than red wines in this case, but within white wines, you can have one that's very full bodied.

112
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,040
So this is a great phrase for describing wine.

113
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:12,740
We don't really talk about other things being full bodied, but wine can be full bodied if it really has what you say, Marco, this big full taste, a great taste.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,300
That's right.

115
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:23,480
And actually the sales attendant suggested that, well, since the Chardonnay is more full bodied, then he would recommend maybe a Sauvignon Blanc.

116
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,279
All right.

117
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:29,500
So Sauvignon Blanc, Blanc is the French word for white, but we use this all the time in English.

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,740
Sauvignon Blanc being the kind of wine.

119
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,579
Again, it's a white wine and it's a bit brighter than the Chardonnay.

120
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,959
That's what the salesperson said.

121
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,540
That's right.

122
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:50,600
And when we're talking about wines, either red wines or white wines, this the way to describe it or the different varieties is actually a varietal of the wines or the type of grape.

123
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:51,360
Right.

124
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,399
So varietal.

125
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:54,939
So you think of variety, varietal.

126
00:06:54,939 --> 00:07:02,500
Varietal is a specific wine word that we use to describe the kind of grape that go into a wine.

127
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,720
So we know wine generally comes from grapes.

128
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,620
They're crushed down and then the alcohol comes from all the sugars.

129
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,300
But each different kind of grape has a different flavor and that's the varietal, the kind of grape.

130
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:15,899
That's right.

131
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,519
So just think of it as the variety of the wines that you have and it's words used specifically for wines.

132
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:33,379
And well, when the attendant kept talking about the wines and the types of wines they have there, he mentioned that they have a small selection in the refrigerator or in the cooler.

133
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,079
So selection in this case means what the store has to offer.

134
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,040
It means all the wines that they sell.

135
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,480
So maybe if you have an extensive selection, it means you have many, many, many different kinds to choose from.

136
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,300
But if you don't have an extensive selection, you have very few wines, that means that you have fewer things to sell.

137
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,319
That's right.

138
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:59,160
So a wide selection of wines or a small selection of wines.

139
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:07,060
And lastly, talking about varietals, we also have what we call a blend, a blend of a few different types of grapes.

140
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:14,180
All right, so you can have blends of different things, but in terms of wine, we're talking about using different grapes together to make one wine.

141
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:19,040
All right, so this is something that's pretty common and it's a way to achieve different flavors.

142
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:19,759
That's right.

143
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,420
So a blend, you also talk about it in, I think, whiskies.

144
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,839
You have a blended whiskies.

145
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,500
That's right.

146
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,980
So you can have a single malt, which is one grain in one barrel, or you can have a blend, which would be different grains fermented in different barrels mixed together later.

147
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:35,500
Okay.

148
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,139
So a lot of great stuff here all about wines.

149
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,159
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

150
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,000
Hello there, welcome to Wine World.

151
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,240
Let me know if I can help you out at all.

152
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,639
Yes, please.

153
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,879
I could really use some help.

154
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,940
I'm going over to my boss's house for dinner tonight and I don't know what kind of wine I should bring.

155
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:56,620
Okay.

156
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,960
Uh, do you know what kind of food will be served?

157
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,720
Well, his wife is Japanese.

158
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,740
He said she makes really good sushi.

159
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:04,980
Hmm.

160
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:07,019
That's a bit of a challenge.

161
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,639
Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.

162
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,399
Well, let's see.

163
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,100
It'll have to be a white wine, of course.

164
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,019
Why?

165
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,519
Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?

166
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,080
No, I don't think so.

167
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,179
Sushi is a very delicately flavored food and red wine would be a jarring contrast.

168
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,620
You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors to compliment the fish.

169
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:31,820
I see.

170
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,559
So I should get a bottle of Chardonnay.

171
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,659
That's a white wine, right?

172
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,879
Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet.

173
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:44,879
Chardonnay is one of the more full-bodied whites and tends to be a bit oaky.

174
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,340
I'd suggest you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

175
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,840
Oh, the Sauvignon Blanc?

176
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:53,700
What's that?

177
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,639
That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

178
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:58,480
Let's see.

179
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:05,460
The label says it's got attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp mineral flavors and a bone-dry finish.

180
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,700
Served chilled.

181
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:07,840
Oh, no.

182
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,480
How long will it take to chill the wine?

183
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,159
I'm on my way to dinner now.

184
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,940
Oh, it's okay.

185
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,519
Don't worry.

186
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,659
We'll just choose a wine from the cooler.

187
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,120
We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but this Rhone Valley White would be lovely.

188
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:22,940
All right.

189
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,019
What varietal is that?

190
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,279
Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label.

191
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:36,039
The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine.

192
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:42,620
This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.

193
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,299
And do you think this is a good wine?

194
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:44,799
Yes.

195
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,240
This is one of our best sellers.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,480
It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable.

197
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,820
It's light and crisp with a bit of a vanilla aroma.

198
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:56,580
Perfect.

199
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:57,639
I'll take it.

200
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,220
All right, so obviously there are a lot more varietals out there.

201
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,460
We only talked about two types of wines.

202
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,159
We had a Chardonnay and a Sauvignon Blanc.

203
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:11,820
That's right.

204
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:13,980
And the only wines we talked about were white wines.

205
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,960
Of course, there's a whole world of red wines out there.

206
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,600
And then between red and white, you have rosé, which are those pink wines.

207
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,639
Those pink wines, yeah.

208
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:32,100
But actually, it's interesting because the culture of drinking wine is not as extensive as we think it is.

209
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,440
In many parts of the world, they're not really used to drinking wine.

210
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:36,379
That's right.

211
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:47,840
But then you go to places like France and Italy and South America, like Argentina, Chile, and you experience these different cultures of wine that are, I think, quite interesting because they're so different.

212
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,320
Yeah, that's right.

213
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,159
And it's become even healthy to drink wine.

214
00:11:53,679 --> 00:12:00,500
Medical tests show that if you have one glass of wine with dinner every day, it reduces your chances of heart disease.

215
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:01,379
That's right.

216
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,500
There's some special ingredient.

217
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm not sure what it is, but obviously you don't want to drink too much.

218
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:08,159
But if you have a little bit, it's good for your heart.

219
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,120
I think red wine, they say, is good for your heart.

220
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:21,259
So it's interesting, but obviously maybe in your countries you don't drink wine, or maybe you have a particular type of wine, like in China they have, isn't it, plum wine or rice wine.

221
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,059
Rice wine in China and plum wine, I think, in Japan.

222
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:24,559
In Japan.

223
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,279
So maybe you have a specific type of wine that you want to let us know about, and of course if you have any questions or comments, we're always there.

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,320

225
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,000
All right, we'll see you again.

226
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,320
Bye.
