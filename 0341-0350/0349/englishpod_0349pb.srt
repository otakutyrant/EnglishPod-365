00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,819
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,599
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,740
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,080
And today we have a very advanced lesson for you all about medicine.

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:10,960
That's right.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,699
Today we're going to take a look at what is very widely known as Chinese traditional medicine.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,760
So a very interesting topic in general.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:20,579
That's right.

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,640
And for people who use this, they might call it TCM, Traditional Chinese Medicine.

10
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,899
So remember that there's that acronym as well.

11
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,000
But let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

12
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:34,560
And when we come back, we'll be discussing some of the important words and phrases in the dialogue.

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,359
What's wrong?

14
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:42,679
I have a headache.

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,939
These past few days, I've been living off painkillers.

16
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:48,600
Man, I feel like my head is going to explode.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,520
You should get acupuncture treatment.

18
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,820
My mom was always having headache issues, and it was acupuncture that cured her.

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,479
The results are too slow.

20
00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:00,939
On top of that, just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me.

21
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,200
They don't just randomly stick you, they find your pressure points.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,379
The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment, restoring the body's chi.

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,739
But I get scared the moment I see a needle.

24
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,400
How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end?

25
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,599
The needles are very thin, and as long as the doctor's technique is good and the patient himself is relaxed, it won't hurt.

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,400
On the contrary, it will actually alleviate pain.

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,040
Now, there are high-tech needles that are micro-thin.

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,980
They don't hurt at all.

29
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,099
However, if you are really scared of acupuncture, scraping or cupping are also options.

30
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,879
Scraping is too terrifying.

31
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,980
When they finish scraping, your body is all red, as if you were just tortured.

32
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,620
Cupping is the same.

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,900
Your body ends up with red circles all over it.

34
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,260
It looks like someone beat you up.

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,340
This only signifies that the toxins have left the body.

36
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:48,959
Actually, there's only discomfort during the treatment process.

37
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,000
Once it's over, you'll feel very comfortable.

38
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,920
Chinese medicine is strange.

39
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,359
The patients are already ill, and then the doctor makes them suffer more.

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,579
This is the only way to get at the problem.

41
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,280
Anyway, if you want to relieve the pain, you are just going to have to be tough and do it.

42
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,060
Forget it.

43
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,599
I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself.

44
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,139
In a little while, I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap.

45
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,120
All right, we're back.

46
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:23,800
So, now obviously we are talking about what is commonly known as alternative medicine because we know that traditional medicine nowadays is doctors.

47
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,560
You have antibiotics, that sort of thing.

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,060
Here you're actually using these techniques and these different ways of curing someone.

49
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,120
The first thing that comes to mind here is acupuncture.

50
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,340
That's right.

51
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:50,740
Acupuncture is usually considered a part of Chinese medicine, and it's a kind of medicine that uses needles in different parts of the body.

52
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:57,319
So it might look really scary because you see people lying on their stomachs with needles coming out of their backs.

53
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,680
And the places where they put the needles in, they're called pressure points, right?

54
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,560
That's right.

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,699
And pressure points are things that we talk about with massages as well.

56
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:14,819
So a good masseuse, a person who does a massage, will also look for these pressure points, which are key points on the body.

57
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:24,159
And in acupuncture, they'll put these needles into those points as well because each point relates to a different part of the body, like the liver or the kidneys.

58
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:24,960
Right.

59
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:37,939
So it's actually very interesting, the fact that by sticking a needle in one of these pressure points, they are curing or alleviating the pain of maybe, like you say, your kidney or your liver or something like this.

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,960
This is a really great word though, Mark, or the word that you just used, to alleviate pain.

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,080
Now to alleviate pain means to make the pain go away.

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,219
So we heard the opposite of that as well, also at the very end of today's dialogue.

63
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:52,659
Right.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,340
So the opposite of alleviate would be to inflict pain.

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,180
This is to do pain to yourself or to someone else.

66
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,300
To cause pain.

67
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,180
To cause pain.

68
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,879
So to alleviate is to take it away and to inflict is to cause.

69
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:19,800
So now acupuncture is very popular, sticking needles in people's pressure points, it does seem like it would hurt, but there are other ones that maybe are not as widely known.

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,000
The next one that we're going to talk about is scraping.

71
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:24,379
Scraping.

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:40,600
So to scrape is a verb and you can scrape the bottom of your plate with your spoon or you can scrape on, you know, sometimes cats like to scrape on the furniture, they use their claws and make that sound.

73
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,379
But in this case, scraping is a little bit more maybe painful sounding.

74
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,000
What do they do in scraping?

75
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,920
So basically it's the same thing, they use different tools and they scrape your body.

76
00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:04,160
They just, I don't know, basically what I understand from it is that they are extracting the illness by taking it out of your skin.

77
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:15,420
So they use what looks like a small knife or like a flat kind of sharp blade and they actually kind of take off the top layer of your skin, they scrape it away.

78
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:35,639
It's very very painful from what I've heard, I've never done it myself, but as we see in dialogue, it does look very, it looks like you've been hit or treated poorly in prison or something because your skin is red and almost bleeding.

79
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,819
That's right and another one that actually looks quite painful when you see someone after they've done it is called cupping.

80
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,480
Right.

81
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,639
Now this one you might have seen even in the last Karate Kid movie.

82
00:05:47,639 --> 00:06:13,519
Basically it's a little round bulb or a little round glass cup and the doctor, the Chinese doctor will light a piece of cotton and will put the cup over it and the suction effect that by putting out the fire and it sucks up all the oxygen and everything causes the cup to suck onto your skin really really tight.

83
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:31,920
Yeah it's like you pull it, you put it onto your skin so it creates a vacuum right, there's no air coming in and that way the cup that there's no air in has to pull out all those chemicals and those toxins and that oil from your skin and take it away.

84
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:32,480
Right.

85
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,019
Right so it's actually pulling at your skin.

86
00:06:35,579 --> 00:07:01,980
Yeah and well that's the thing with the vacuum effect is so great and pulling it out with such force that you're actually left with a big purple or red circle on your skin from I guess the blood clot type thing effect that is caused by it so you will see a person's back maybe and they have bruises, yeah like six, seven, ten bruises on their backs.

87
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:13,680
Although I am told that even though it's very painful and it looks even more painful, the effect is that it does help your circulation, it helps the blood in your body move around more freely.

88
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:33,220
Yeah I've heard the same thing and even though that it looks painful and it may be painful while they're doing it, I've heard that after it's done even though it looks like it should hurt, it looks like a bruise, it doesn't hurt like a bruise so people don't actually say oh you know don't touch my back it really hurts, it doesn't really seem that way.

89
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,259
Well there's an interesting line in the dialogue that is related to this.

90
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,399
It's about scraping actually but you can say it about cupping as well.

91
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,959
Your body is all red as if you were just tortured.

92
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:54,480
Now as if you were tortured or we could say as if you were beaten up and in this case was the person tortured?

93
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,120
No.

94
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:10,259
So it's basically a relation or making that relation that your skin is so let's say bloody that it looks as if you were tortured so it seems like somebody hit you with a whip or something.

95
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:16,459
It looks like you were tortured but you weren't so as if is a way for us to make a comparison or an analogy.

96
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:17,040
Right.

97
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,480
I think you can see it in maybe books you know.

98
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,639
So maybe you would describe a guy saying oh he was really angry as if he had rabies.

99
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,259
Yeah it's as if he had rabies like he doesn't but he's acting like he does.

100
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,980
Or maybe you run into the kitchen and eat so much food as if you hadn't eaten in days.

101
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,720
Exactly so you have obviously but you're acting like someone who is starving.

102
00:08:43,659 --> 00:09:07,899
So yeah that is an interesting way to describe or to make a connection between two different things and well Chinese traditional medicine as well a very interesting and historical form of treating illnesses now I'm told that it does work even though some people are very skeptical about it and I don't think it's accepted in the international medical field.

103
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,399
Well I think that there's a Western medicine which has its benefits.

104
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:23,299
You know you have penicillin and all of these different antibiotics to help us combat different diseases and bacteria but also traditional Chinese medicine kind of helps other things.

105
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:54,679
I think there is a spirituality this idea that we have a chi there are positive and negative forces in our bodies and sometimes trauma or big events will make that chi kind of well it'll affect it in a bad way so the chi is unbalanced and so a lot of this is about rebalancing your system and if you believe that and you really understand that you know there are certain forces inside your body then I'm sure this kind of medicine has a positive effect on you.

106
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:59,879
Right I believe that it does have its its ups and downs.

107
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:38,639
I was very skeptical about until once actually I had a very very very bad headache and somebody took and pushed a pressure point on my finger on my thumb for about maybe one or two minutes and the headache was gone so it was very I was very much amazed but at the same time when people are treated maybe for you know maybe they can't conceive a baby and they're doing these rituals or giving them ginger or different roots to drink and eat and stuff I don't know if that really does help or what evidence there is that it actually does work.

108
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:52,580
Well I think that's something that also is important to look at on an individual basis you know I don't think I don't think even some Western medicines help all the time if you're not in a place where you believe that it will work you know so.

109
00:10:53,019 --> 00:11:17,940
Yeah it's very it's but the interesting aspect of it is of course so many years ago we're talking about hundreds or thousands years ago when there was no Western medicine and then people were being cured and treated by these techniques which actually worked so there is a very interesting aspect that maybe even Western medicine can learn from traditional medicine like this.

110
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:25,399
So it's an interesting topic Oriental medicine Western medicine but we want to know what you think about it.

111
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:37,039
We also want to know in your home country do you have a traditional kind of medicine or any medical alternatives to Western medicine let us know our website is EnglishPod.com all right we'll see you guys there.

112
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,440
Bye.
