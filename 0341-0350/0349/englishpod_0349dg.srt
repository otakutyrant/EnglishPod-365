EnglishPod.com What's wrong?

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,640
I have a headache.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,900
These past few days I've been living off painkillers.

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,560
Man, I feel like my head is going to explode.

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,500
You should get acupuncture treatment.

6
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:19,820
My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her.

7
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:21,460
The results are too slow.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,879
On top of that, just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me.

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,879
They don't just randomly stick you.

10
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,199
They find your pressure points.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,399
The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment, restoring the body's chi.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,719
But I get scared the moment I see a needle.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,359
How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end?

14
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:47,560
The needles are very thin and as long as the doctor's technique is good and the patient himself is relaxed, it won't hurt.

15
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,399
On the contrary, it will actually alleviate pain.

16
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:53,039
Now there are high tech needles that are micro-thin.

17
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,000
They don't hurt at all.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,100
However, if you are really scared of acupuncture, scraping or cupping are also options.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,880
Scraping is too terrifying.

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,960
When they finish scraping, your body is all red as if you were just tortured.

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,599
Cupping is the same.

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,879
Your body ends up with red circles all over it.

23
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,299
It looks like someone beat you up.

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,340
This only signifies that the toxins have left the body.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,939
Actually, there's only discomfort during the treatment process.

26
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,980
Once it's over, you'll feel very comfortable.

27
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,900
Chinese medicine is strange.

28
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:22,340
The patients are already ill and then the doctor makes them suffer more.

29
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,560
This is the only way to get at the problem.

30
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,260
Anyway, if you want to relieve the pain, you are just going to have to be tough and do it.

31
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,019
Forget it.

32
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,579
I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself.

33
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,060
In a little while, I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap.
