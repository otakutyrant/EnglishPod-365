00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com What's wrong?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I have a headache.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
These past few days I've been living off painkillers.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Man, I feel like my head is going to explode.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You should get acupuncture treatment.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The results are too slow.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
On top of that, just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They don't just randomly stick you.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They find your pressure points.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment, restoring the body's chi.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But I get scared the moment I see a needle.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The needles are very thin and as long as the doctor's technique is good and the patient himself is relaxed, it won't hurt.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
On the contrary, it will actually alleviate pain.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now there are high tech needles that are micro-thin.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
They don't hurt at all.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
However, if you are really scared of acupuncture, scraping or cupping are also options.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Scraping is too terrifying.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
When they finish scraping, your body is all red as if you were just tortured.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Cupping is the same.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Your body ends up with red circles all over it.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It looks like someone beat you up.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This only signifies that the toxins have left the body.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Actually, there's only discomfort during the treatment process.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Once it's over, you'll feel very comfortable.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Chinese medicine is strange.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The patients are already ill and then the doctor makes them suffer more.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is the only way to get at the problem.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Anyway, if you want to relieve the pain, you are just going to have to be tough and do it.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Forget it.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
In a little while, I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap.
