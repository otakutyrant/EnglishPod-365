00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,379
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,219
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:09,339
My name is Catherine, and today we're traveling a little bit, and we need to book a hotel room.

4
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:17,100
That's right, so today we're going to learn all the words and phrases that will help you talk to the receptionist in order to book a hotel room.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,760
Let's check out our dialogue.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,940
Madison Sweets, how may I help you?

7
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:29,059
Yes, I am calling from Mexico.

8
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:33,520
I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability.

9
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:36,659
Okay, ma'am, can you tell me the date you expect to check in?

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,600
Yes, July 9th.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,079
I will be there for seven nights.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,840
We have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,920
What's the difference?

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,799
The junior suite is smaller and has one twin bed, while the superior suite has a double bed and mini bar.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,380
Okay, I would like to reserve the superior suite.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,799
Is breakfast included?

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,359
Yes, a buffet breakfast is served every morning.

18
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,740
I will need your name and your credit card details in order to complete the reservation.

19
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,240
Sure, my credit card number is...

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,079
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at language takeaway.

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,500
Language takeaway.

22
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:18,859
So we've got a lot of great phrases and words today in language takeaway.

23
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:21,819
The first one comes from the beginning of the dialogue.

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,480
It's availability.

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,219
Alright, so the woman wanted to know if the hotel has availability.

26
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,400
So what does that mean?

27
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,840
That means, do you have free rooms?

28
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,739
Do you have any rooms I could rent?

29
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:42,079
So instead of saying, do you have any free rooms or do you have rooms available, you can just say, do you have availability?

30
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,640
That's right, so you're basically asking the person, do you have anything available?

31
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,439
So what's your availability?

32
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:51,060
Very good, okay.

33
00:01:51,539 --> 00:02:00,500
Alright, so we asked the hotel if they have availability and obviously the receptionist needs to know when we expect to check in.

34
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:08,860
So this is a noun and a verb, but in today's dialogue it's used as a verb, so it's something we do, to check in.

35
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,659
So the person on the phone would like to know what date you expect to check in.

36
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,639
That means, when will you arrive at our hotel?

37
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,740
That's right, so maybe we will arrive to the city a couple of days before we check into the hotel.

38
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,219
So we really specifically want to know when are you going to start sleeping here.

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,340
That's right, and the opposite, so when you leave the hotel, is called check out, to check out.

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,080
That's right.

41
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:43,599
Okay, so we want to check in on July 9th and the receptionist tells us that we have available a single suite or a double suite.

42
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,340
Alright, so these are two different kinds of rooms.

43
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:55,180
Now a suite is different from a room because it actually means that the space you're going to use is more than one room, maybe two rooms or three.

44
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,419
That's right, so it's a little bit bigger than just a standard room.

45
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:05,340
It might have a sitting area or a kitchen area, so that's what a suite is.

46
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:12,340
Very expensive rooms are suites as well, they have a sitting area and a kitchen and maybe even an extra bedroom.

47
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,099
That's right.

48
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:20,280
Okay, so we have a single suite, that means that we have one of these big rooms that is only for one person.

49
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,879
And a double suite means that two or more people can sleep there.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,800
That's right, so single would be one person and double would be two people.

51
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:41,120
And we also heard similar words with the beds because sometimes the rooms aren't really clear about what kind of beds they have, so this person asked, what's the difference between these rooms?

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,659
And the hotel employee answered, well the junior suite has one twin bed.

53
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,659
Alright, what's a twin bed?

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,180
So a twin bed is basically a bed that's only for one person, only one person fits in there.

55
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:05,099
Alright, so it's a single bed basically, we call it a twin, it's a standard size, so everywhere you go, a twin is always for one person.

56
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,800
That's right.

57
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:11,060
Alright, and if you want to have another person in bed, we have to get a bigger one, and what's that bigger bed called?

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,400
It's called a double bed.

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,680
A double bed, so again double, double room, double bed.

60
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,339
So this means that two people can sleep on the one bed.

61
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,079
That's right.

62
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:28,740
So this is important because sometimes you want to book a hotel room and it will be a double suite, but it will have two twin beds.

63
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,920
Alright, so it's a double room, so it's for two people, but each person has their own small bed.

64
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,540
That's right.

65
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,740
That's two twin beds.

66
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,939
Okay, and lastly, the superior double suite not only had a double bed, but also had a mini bar.

67
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,019
A mini bar, so you know what a bar is, it's a place you go to get some alcohol or some drinks, but a mini bar is a little bit different, right?

68
00:04:52,740 --> 00:05:04,560
It's a little refrigerator or a little area where you will have snacks and drinks that you can just basically take freely, but obviously you will have to pay afterwards.

69
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:11,860
That's right, so you can take them when you're staying there, but when you check out, when you leave, you have to pay for everything you ate or drank.

70
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:12,560
That's right.

71
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,519
Okay, so a lot of words there on language takeaway today.

72
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,079
Let's take a break and listen to the dialogue again.

73
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:26,000
Madison Sweets, how may I help you?

74
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:28,120
Yes, I am calling from Mexico.

75
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,600
I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability.

76
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,759
Okay, ma'am, can you tell me the date you expect to check in?

77
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,660
Yes, July 9th.

78
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,120
I will be there for seven nights.

79
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,899
We have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates.

80
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,000
What's the difference?

81
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:49,879
The junior suite is smaller and has one twin bed, while the superior suite has a double bed and mini bar.

82
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,459
Okay, I would like to reserve the superior suite.

83
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,839
Is breakfast included?

84
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,439
Yes, a buffet breakfast is served every morning.

85
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,779
I will need your name and your credit card details in order to complete the reservation.

86
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,300
Sure, my credit card number is...

87
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,079
Alright, so now it's time for some phrases.

88
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,800
Let's start with fluency builder.

89
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,839
So the first phrase in fluency builder might seem a little bit strange.

90
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,120
It's I will be in town next week.

91
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:20,980
I'll be in town?

92
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,800
In what town?

93
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,639
That's right.

94
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:28,120
Well, if you say I will be in town, that basically says I will be in this town.

95
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,800
I will be there.

96
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,620
I will be here.

97
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,480
So I'll be in the town you're in.

98
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:33,459
This is interesting.

99
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:41,839
So when I'm talking to someone, maybe Marco is in Chicago and I'm in New York, I call and I say, hey Marco, I'll be in town next week.

100
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,680
What are you doing?

101
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,279
Right.

102
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,699
You want to have a drink.

103
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,180
That means I'm going to be where?

104
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,319
You're going to be in Chicago.

105
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,759
That's right.

106
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,420
I'll be in Chicago like Marco is.

107
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,740
I'm not going to talk about where I am now.

108
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,600
This usually means I'm going somewhere else.

109
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:54,379
That's right.

110
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:01,819
So actually you can tell your friends that you're going to be in town or sometimes you have to tell someone you're going to be out of town.

111
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:03,199
I'll be out of town.

112
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,199
That means I won't be where I am now.

113
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,120
I won't be in New York.

114
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,339
I'll be somewhere else.

115
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,139
I'll be in Chicago.

116
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:08,980
That's right.

117
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,480
All right.

118
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:20,399
So now moving on where when we were talking specifically about the hotel and maybe what is included with our suite, we asked a very important question.

119
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,519
Is breakfast included?

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,040
Included in what?

121
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,399
In the price.

122
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:26,139
All right.

123
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,759
So this is a very common question, like you're saying, Marco, but it's not obvious.

124
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,220
So when you ask is breakfast included, that means do I have to pay extra for breakfast?

125
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,160
If breakfast is included, I don't have to pay.

126
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,120
If it's not included, that means I have to pay extra for breakfast.

127
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,040
That's right.

128
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,579
And in this case, breakfast is included, but not just any breakfast.

129
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,040
It's a buffet breakfast.

130
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,560
My favorite kind of breakfast.

131
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,860
So this is pretty common with hotels.

132
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,279
They will serve a buffet breakfast from 7 a.m.

133
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,300
to 9 a.m.

134
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:57,860
or whatever.

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,480
A buffet means that there's a room with tables and food on the tables.

136
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,480
So you don't order food.

137
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,079
You just take whatever you want.

138
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,720
That's right.

139
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,079
So you can take whatever you want and usually as much as you want.

140
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,939
That's the best part.

141
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:12,779
Okay.

142
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,300
So now we know that breakfast is included.

143
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,959
We know what a room is like.

144
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:25,379
So we're going to make the reservation and the hotel employee says that he needs our credit card details to complete the reservation.

145
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,740
Credit card details.

146
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,680
Now you might be wondering what details?

147
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,580
Credit card details means the specific information on your credit card.

148
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,340
All right.

149
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,720
So this is pretty common when you're making a purchase on the phone or on the Internet.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,919
You have to enter.

151
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,000
You have to provide your credit card details.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,480
That means your name, your credit card number, and the expiration date which is when the card will no longer be useful.

153
00:08:51,580 --> 00:09:01,159
So it's necessary because obviously you can say, yeah, I'm going to be there tomorrow and then you don't show up and the hotel loses money so they need to make sure that they have you somehow.

154
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:03,259
Yeah, that's their way of protecting themselves.

155
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,179
They want to give you the room but they also don't want to lose money.

156
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:06,679
Okay.

157
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:11,379
So let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

158
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:12,320
All right, so talking about hotels, I think one of the most important things out of this, well, not important but also something you should know is that the minibar is always so expensive.

159
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,879
It is expensive.

160
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,539
Very careful when you're going into that minibar.

161
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,399
Sometimes it seems like a really good idea.

162
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:30,639
You're hungry and there are crackers or you want a beer but you have to look at the menu because the menu will have the prices and maybe something that's really cheap in a store outside is really expensive at a hotel.

163
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,539
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:42,480
And I think sometimes, I don't know, sometimes it's even hard to find that little menu so you don't even know what the prices are but you're so thirsty, you just want to have something to drink now and it ends up costing you $10.

165
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,159
That's right.

166
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:43,759
So be careful.

167
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:55,399
Anytime you're in a hotel room, expect the prices to be pretty high for the things in the hotel unless of course there's a sign or a piece of paper that says that something is free or complimentary.

168
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,480
Yeah, that's right.

169
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,919
Complimentary water is very common in hotels.

170
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,480
They'll give you two free bottles of water.

171
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,019
That's right.

172
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,120
So complimentary means you don't have to pay for it but if there's no sign, then expect to pay a lot.

173
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,740
That's right.

174
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,179
Okay.
