00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're traveling a little bit, and we need to book a hotel room.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right, so today we're going to learn all the words and phrases that will help you talk to the receptionist in order to book a hotel room.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's check out our dialogue.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Madison Sweets, how may I help you?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, I am calling from Mexico.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, ma'am, can you tell me the date you expect to check in?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes, July 9th.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will be there for seven nights.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What's the difference?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The junior suite is smaller and has one twin bed, while the superior suite has a double bed and mini bar.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, I would like to reserve the superior suite.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is breakfast included?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, a buffet breakfast is served every morning.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I will need your name and your credit card details in order to complete the reservation.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sure, my credit card number is...

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at language takeaway.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Language takeaway.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So we've got a lot of great phrases and words today in language takeaway.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The first one comes from the beginning of the dialogue.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's availability.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Alright, so the woman wanted to know if the hotel has availability.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So what does that mean?

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That means, do you have free rooms?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Do you have any rooms I could rent?

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So instead of saying, do you have any free rooms or do you have rooms available, you can just say, do you have availability?

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's right, so you're basically asking the person, do you have anything available?

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So what's your availability?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Very good, okay.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alright, so we asked the hotel if they have availability and obviously the receptionist needs to know when we expect to check in.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So this is a noun and a verb, but in today's dialogue it's used as a verb, so it's something we do, to check in.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So the person on the phone would like to know what date you expect to check in.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That means, when will you arrive at our hotel?

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's right, so maybe we will arrive to the city a couple of days before we check into the hotel.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So we really specifically want to know when are you going to start sleeping here.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's right, and the opposite, so when you leave the hotel, is called check out, to check out.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's right.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay, so we want to check in on July 9th and the receptionist tells us that we have available a single suite or a double suite.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Alright, so these are two different kinds of rooms.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now a suite is different from a room because it actually means that the space you're going to use is more than one room, maybe two rooms or three.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's right, so it's a little bit bigger than just a standard room.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It might have a sitting area or a kitchen area, so that's what a suite is.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Very expensive rooms are suites as well, they have a sitting area and a kitchen and maybe even an extra bedroom.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, so we have a single suite, that means that we have one of these big rooms that is only for one person.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And a double suite means that two or more people can sleep there.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's right, so single would be one person and double would be two people.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And we also heard similar words with the beds because sometimes the rooms aren't really clear about what kind of beds they have, so this person asked, what's the difference between these rooms?

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And the hotel employee answered, well the junior suite has one twin bed.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Alright, what's a twin bed?

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So a twin bed is basically a bed that's only for one person, only one person fits in there.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Alright, so it's a single bed basically, we call it a twin, it's a standard size, so everywhere you go, a twin is always for one person.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Alright, and if you want to have another person in bed, we have to get a bigger one, and what's that bigger bed called?

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's called a double bed.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
A double bed, so again double, double room, double bed.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So this means that two people can sleep on the one bed.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So this is important because sometimes you want to book a hotel room and it will be a double suite, but it will have two twin beds.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Alright, so it's a double room, so it's for two people, but each person has their own small bed.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's right.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's two twin beds.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay, and lastly, the superior double suite not only had a double bed, but also had a mini bar.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
A mini bar, so you know what a bar is, it's a place you go to get some alcohol or some drinks, but a mini bar is a little bit different, right?

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a little refrigerator or a little area where you will have snacks and drinks that you can just basically take freely, but obviously you will have to pay afterwards.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's right, so you can take them when you're staying there, but when you check out, when you leave, you have to pay for everything you ate or drank.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's right.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay, so a lot of words there on language takeaway today.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's take a break and listen to the dialogue again.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Madison Sweets, how may I help you?

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, I am calling from Mexico.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay, ma'am, can you tell me the date you expect to check in?

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes, July 9th.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I will be there for seven nights.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What's the difference?

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The junior suite is smaller and has one twin bed, while the superior suite has a double bed and mini bar.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, I would like to reserve the superior suite.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is breakfast included?

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes, a buffet breakfast is served every morning.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I will need your name and your credit card details in order to complete the reservation.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sure, my credit card number is...

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Alright, so now it's time for some phrases.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's start with fluency builder.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So the first phrase in fluency builder might seem a little bit strange.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's I will be in town next week.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll be in town?

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In what town?

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's right.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, if you say I will be in town, that basically says I will be in this town.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I will be there.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I will be here.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So I'll be in the town you're in.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is interesting.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So when I'm talking to someone, maybe Marco is in Chicago and I'm in New York, I call and I say, hey Marco, I'll be in town next week.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What are you doing?

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Right.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You want to have a drink.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That means I'm going to be where?

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're going to be in Chicago.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's right.

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll be in Chicago like Marco is.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm not going to talk about where I am now.

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This usually means I'm going somewhere else.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's right.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So actually you can tell your friends that you're going to be in town or sometimes you have to tell someone you're going to be out of town.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll be out of town.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That means I won't be where I am now.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I won't be in New York.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll be somewhere else.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll be in Chicago.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's right.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
All right.

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So now moving on where when we were talking specifically about the hotel and maybe what is included with our suite, we asked a very important question.

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Is breakfast included?

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Included in what?

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
In the price.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
All right.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So this is a very common question, like you're saying, Marco, but it's not obvious.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So when you ask is breakfast included, that means do I have to pay extra for breakfast?

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If breakfast is included, I don't have to pay.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If it's not included, that means I have to pay extra for breakfast.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's right.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And in this case, breakfast is included, but not just any breakfast.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's a buffet breakfast.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
My favorite kind of breakfast.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So this is pretty common with hotels.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They will serve a buffet breakfast from 7 a.m.

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
to 9 a.m.

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
or whatever.

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
A buffet means that there's a room with tables and food on the tables.

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So you don't order food.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You just take whatever you want.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So you can take whatever you want and usually as much as you want.

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's the best part.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So now we know that breakfast is included.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We know what a room is like.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So we're going to make the reservation and the hotel employee says that he needs our credit card details to complete the reservation.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Credit card details.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Now you might be wondering what details?

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Credit card details means the specific information on your credit card.

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All right.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So this is pretty common when you're making a purchase on the phone or on the Internet.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You have to enter.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You have to provide your credit card details.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That means your name, your credit card number, and the expiration date which is when the card will no longer be useful.

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So it's necessary because obviously you can say, yeah, I'm going to be there tomorrow and then you don't show up and the hotel loses money so they need to make sure that they have you somehow.

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah, that's their way of protecting themselves.

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
They want to give you the room but they also don't want to lose money.

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:12,000
All right, so talking about hotels, I think one of the most important things out of this, well, not important but also something you should know is that the minibar is always so expensive.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It is expensive.

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Very careful when you're going into that minibar.

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Sometimes it seems like a really good idea.

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're hungry and there are crackers or you want a beer but you have to look at the menu because the menu will have the prices and maybe something that's really cheap in a store outside is really expensive at a hotel.

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And I think sometimes, I don't know, sometimes it's even hard to find that little menu so you don't even know what the prices are but you're so thirsty, you just want to have something to drink now and it ends up costing you $10.

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's right.

166
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So be careful.

167
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Anytime you're in a hotel room, expect the prices to be pretty high for the things in the hotel unless of course there's a sign or a piece of paper that says that something is free or complimentary.

168
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, that's right.

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Complimentary water is very common in hotels.

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They'll give you two free bottles of water.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's right.

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So complimentary means you don't have to pay for it but if there's no sign, then expect to pay a lot.

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That's right.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay.

175
