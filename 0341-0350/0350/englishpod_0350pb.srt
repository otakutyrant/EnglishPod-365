00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,940
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,539
My name is Catherine and we're going to a family party today, right Marco?

3
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:16,820
That's right, we're going to go see our family, our relatives, and we're going to talk about all the different family members that you can have.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,300
So there's some very, very specific family members that sometimes you don't really know the names of.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:22,980
That's right.

6
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:26,480
So we're not talking about mother, father, brother, sister.

7
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,699
We're talking about what we call in English, extended family.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,640
So that means not just the people you live with, but also people you're related to, who are maybe in different parts of your family.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,320
That's right.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,759
So let's listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

11
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:47,719
What are you doing this weekend?

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,479
My brother-in-law is having a small get together at his house and he invited me.

13
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,719
Is it a family thing or just friends?

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,719
A bit of both.

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,100
Some cousins, aunts, and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.

16
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,479
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there?

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,740
He is really funny.

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,900
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
You mean your sister?

20
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,099
No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he's my grandmother's brother.

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,640
You lost me.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,659
I'll explain later.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,200
Let's go.

24
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,140
All right, so now let's talk about these family members on Language Takeaway.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,780
Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,540
So Marco, we've got four family members to talk about today.

27
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,219
And the first one is brother-in-law.

28
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:37,040
Right, so we have the word brother-in-law.

29
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,299
So basically this person is married to your sister.

30
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,180
That's right.

31
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:52,579
So I have a brother, I have a sister, but when these people marry, they marry someone who I'm not related to by blood, we call them in-laws.

32
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,280
So brother-in-law, sister-in-law.

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:55,859
Right.

34
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,120
So that's exactly it.

35
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,480
The key there is that when it has the ending in-law, it means that you're not related to them by blood.

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,620
It's your extended family because of marriage.

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,420
That's right.

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,759
So I have a younger brother, when he gets married, I will have a sister-in-law.

39
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,400
That's right.

40
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,900
And it applies to, for example, father-in-law.

41
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,319
That would be your husband's dad, or mother-in-law would be your husband's mother.

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,539
Yeah, so these are all related to you by marriage.

43
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:32,000
All right, so now moving on to the next type of extended family member that we have is a stepson.

44
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:33,719
Your uncle has a stepson.

45
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,199
So a stepson.

46
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,000
Now this can get very confusing.

47
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,939
Let's take a simple, simple family.

48
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,000
We have two people and they're married, but they get divorced.

49
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:55,180
So they split up and now maybe they had some kids, the wife has kids, and she gets married to someone else.

50
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:04,180
So her new husband calls her son his stepson, because it's not his son.

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,580
It's another man's son.

52
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,599
But they're still related by marriage.

53
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:15,620
So when your new husband or your new wife has kids from another marriage, they're called stepson, stepdaughter.

54
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:16,319
That's right.

55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,000
So it's the same thing as if my mother got divorced and she remarried.

56
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:22,520
She has a new husband.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,819
That man would be my stepfather.

58
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,219
All right, so these are all family members.

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,740
When you hear the word step, family members that we have because of divorce.

60
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,860
So stepson, stepdaughter, stepfather, stepmother.

61
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:47,000
All right, and now again, related to the whole divorce thing, the person that you get divorced to is called an ex-wife or an ex-husband.

62
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,939
All right, so ex, like ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend means previous.

63
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:05,360
So my ex-wife is someone I was married to before, or in the case of a woman, my ex-husband was someone I was married to before, but we got divorced, so we're not married now.

64
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,500
That's exactly it.

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,419
So, and it only applies to husband and wife, right?

66
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:13,800
You don't say my ex-children or my ex-mother-in-law.

67
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,459
Well, because your children are always your children.

68
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,319
All right.

69
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:27,120
If you talk about your ex-wife's parents, you just say my ex-wife's father or my ex-wife's mother because there's no more in law.

70
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:27,879
There's no law.

71
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,680
You're not married.

72
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,079
Right.

73
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:29,680
Okay.

74
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,319
And lastly, now we have an uncle, but just not any uncle.

75
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,459
But we have our great uncle.

76
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,000
Great uncle.

77
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,100
So they actually explain this in the dialogue.

78
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,000
They say, he is my grandmother's brother.

79
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:44,160
Okay.

80
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,220
So my uncle, this is simple.

81
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,920
My uncle is my mother's brother or my father's brother, easy.

82
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:53,959
But my great uncle is one of my grandparents' brothers.

83
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:54,560
Right.

84
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,360
So my grandmother's brother or my grandfather's brother.

85
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,180
Right.

86
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,860
In English, we don't distinguish.

87
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,740
We don't say a different word for grandmother's brother or grandfather's brother.

88
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:05,639
Right.

89
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,079
Exactly.

90
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:11,339
So your great uncle could be either your grandmother's brother or your grandfather's brother.

91
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:11,959
That's right.

92
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:18,360
So in my family, I have, well, I just have one great uncle and one great aunt.

93
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,860
My grandmother has a sister, so I have a great aunt and my grandfather has a brother.

94
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,800
So I have a great uncle.

95
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,939
And now the prefix great can also be applied, for example, to grandparents.

96
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,639
So you can say my great grandfather.

97
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,680
That's right.

98
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,500
So we're talking about generations.

99
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,199
I have a grandfather, but his father is my great grandfather.

100
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,680
That means we go back in the past one more generation.

101
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,319
That's right.

102
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:47,180
All right.

103
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,000
So let's take a break and let's listen to the dialogue again.

104
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,980
What are you doing this weekend?

105
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,720
My brother-in-law is having a small get together at his house and he invited me.

106
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,980
Is it a family thing or just friends?

107
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:02,939
A bit of both.

108
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,360
Some cousins, aunts, and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.

109
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,720
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there?

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He is really funny.

111
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,160
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.

112
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:15,740
You mean your sister?

113
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,360
No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he's my grandmother's brother.

114
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,920
You lost me.

115
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:21,899
I'll explain later.

116
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,600
Let's go.

117
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,100
All right.

118
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,500
We're back.

119
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,360
So we've picked out three key phrases for you.

120
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,839
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

121
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:32,620
Fluency Builder.

122
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,319
All right.

123
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,740
So on Fluency Builder, we have a great noun here, actually.

124
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:44,139
You might've heard this before in a different way, but in today's dialogue, we're talking about a small get together.

125
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,339
My brother-in-law is having a small get together.

126
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,800
Now, what is a get together, Mark?

127
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:49,100
Right.

128
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:56,319
So as you notice, we say a get together, meaning that get together, we are taking it as a noun.

129
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,939
And it may be confusing because you see the verb get, right?

130
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,680
And you're thinking it's a verb, but no.

131
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,480
A get together is a reunion, a meeting.

132
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:05,199
All right.

133
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:05,600
A party.

134
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,399
A party.

135
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,699
So maybe it's a very informal party, very casual, not fancy.

136
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,699
A get together, I could say, Marco, I'm having a get together at my apartment.

137
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,939
Do you want to come and bring your girlfriend?

138
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:20,720
Right.

139
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,120
So very simple.

140
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,819
Maybe we have a drink or some food, but it's nothing fancy.

141
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,500
That's right.

142
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,240
Very informal, very casual.

143
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,459
A get together.

144
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:36,600
And when we were asking about the get together, we asked if it's a family thing or is it just friends.

145
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,720
So I want to take a look at this phrase here, a family thing.

146
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,379
Is it a family thing?

147
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,339
What am I asking when I say, okay, Marco, this party you're having, is it a family thing?

148
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,540
Well, you're asking if it's a family reunion, a family party.

149
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,120
So that means if I'm not in your family, can I still come?

150
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:56,920
Right.

151
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,000
Because if it's a family thing, it's just for people in my family.

152
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:01,439
Right.

153
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:01,980
Right.

154
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:04,019
If it's for everyone, no problem.

155
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,560
But I don't want to go to your house if it's a family thing because that's private.

156
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,120
Right.

157
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,180
Right.

158
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,220
So usually, for example, maybe Christmas dinner would usually be a family thing you celebrate with your family mostly.

159
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,480
But it's not always a family thing.

160
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,240
That's what I could say.

161
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:20,259
This year, my birthday is just a family thing.

162
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,040
I'm only inviting family members.

163
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:22,939
Exactly.

164
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:23,860
All right.

165
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:29,899
And lastly, we got a little bit confused with the great uncle and the stepson and the ex-wife.

166
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,680
And so we said, you know what?

167
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,759
You lost me.

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,500
You lost me.

169
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,879
You lost me.

170
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,419
Now, this is another great phrase.

171
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,539
The phrase means, I don't understand.

172
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,220
I'm confused.

173
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,100
That's exactly it.

174
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,500
So if someone is explaining something and I don't understand, then you can say, you know what?

175
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,139
You lost me.

176
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,919
I don't understand.

177
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:50,899
Right.

178
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:57,259
And sometimes I say this when someone is giving a very, very long explanation for something.

179
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:03,840
So to get to my house, you turn left here and then you go two blocks, you turn right and you go straight and you wait for the stoplight.

180
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,460
Then you go to the right-hand corner.

181
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,220
There's a store.

182
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,039
I say, wait, wait, wait.

183
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,159
You lost me.

184
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,379
Right.

185
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:09,820
Exactly.

186
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,779
I don't understand.

187
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,740
I'm confused.

188
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,480
That's right.

189
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,240
All right.

190
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,299
So that's all we have.

191
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,659
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

192
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,600
What are you doing this weekend?

193
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:26,360
My brother-in-law is having a small get together at his house and he invited me.

194
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,600
Is it a family thing or just friends?

195
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,559
A bit of both.

196
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,980
Some cousins, aunts and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.

197
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,379
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there?

198
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,639
He is really funny.

199
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,779
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.

200
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,360
You mean your sister?

201
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,980
No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he's my grandmother's brother.

202
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,519
You lost me.

203
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:48,559
I'll explain later.

204
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,100
Let's go.

205
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,039
So speaking of extended family members, what else can we mention?

206
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:58,340
We have a step family, your stepson, your stepdaughter.

207
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,399
What about if you have an adopted child, would you say, would you differentiate it?

208
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,679
Some people do, some people don't.

209
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:08,139
Most people just say, this is my son, this is my daughter.

210
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,159
But I would like to add that with stepson, stepdaughter, it's not just divorce that we have this.

211
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:24,320
Also, if the parent, maybe the mother dies and the father has a new wife, then the new wife can say, this is my stepson, this is my stepdaughter.

212
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,320
So there are two possibilities.

213
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,539
One is death and one is remarriage because of divorce.

214
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,600
As far as adopted, no, usually just say my son and my daughter, but I can tell you this.

215
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:49,860
If my father and my mother divorce, my father has a new wife, and together they have a baby, the baby boy or girl is my half-brother or half-sister, because we share one parent, my father.

216
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,600
Right, this is very interesting.

217
00:10:51,600 --> 00:11:01,840
So if you do have a brother or sister that is not from your same mother or father, but just one parent, then yeah, it's called a half-brother or sister.

218
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:06,379
Half, remember this, half because half of their parents are the same as your parents.

219
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,299
Maybe one father or mother.

220
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:14,759
But with stepbrothers and stepsisters, the only reason you're related is because of marriage, not because of blood.

221
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:24,980
We didn't mention that you could have a stepbrother, so it's your brother, but he's legally your stepbrother, but he's not related to your father or anyone in your family.

222
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:25,960
That's right, that's right.

223
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
So maybe you have many stepbrothers.

224
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,379
You could have a stepbrother and a half-brother.

225
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:36,500
So there are lots of different combinations because of many different reasons.

226
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:47,080
All right, guys, that's all the time we have for today, but it's a little bit of a confusing topic, so if you have any questions or any doubts, you can come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and you can leave them there.

227
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:49,879
Yeah, we hope to see you guys online, and until next time.

228
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:50,139
Bye.

229
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:50,419
We'll say bye.
