00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine and we're going to a family party today, right Marco?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right, we're going to go see our family, our relatives, and we're going to talk about all the different family members that you can have.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So there's some very, very specific family members that sometimes you don't really know the names of.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we're not talking about mother, father, brother, sister.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're talking about what we call in English, extended family.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So that means not just the people you live with, but also people you're related to, who are maybe in different parts of your family.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So let's listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What are you doing this weekend?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My brother-in-law is having a small get together at his house and he invited me.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Is it a family thing or just friends?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A bit of both.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Some cousins, aunts, and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He is really funny.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You mean your sister?

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he's my grandmother's brother.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You lost me.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll explain later.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's go.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
All right, so now let's talk about these family members on Language Takeaway.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So Marco, we've got four family members to talk about today.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And the first one is brother-in-law.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Right, so we have the word brother-in-law.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So basically this person is married to your sister.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's right.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So I have a brother, I have a sister, but when these people marry, they marry someone who I'm not related to by blood, we call them in-laws.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So brother-in-law, sister-in-law.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Right.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So that's exactly it.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The key there is that when it has the ending in-law, it means that you're not related to them by blood.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's your extended family because of marriage.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's right.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So I have a younger brother, when he gets married, I will have a sister-in-law.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's right.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And it applies to, for example, father-in-law.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That would be your husband's dad, or mother-in-law would be your husband's mother.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, so these are all related to you by marriage.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All right, so now moving on to the next type of extended family member that we have is a stepson.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your uncle has a stepson.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So a stepson.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now this can get very confusing.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's take a simple, simple family.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We have two people and they're married, but they get divorced.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So they split up and now maybe they had some kids, the wife has kids, and she gets married to someone else.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So her new husband calls her son his stepson, because it's not his son.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's another man's son.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But they're still related by marriage.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So when your new husband or your new wife has kids from another marriage, they're called stepson, stepdaughter.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So it's the same thing as if my mother got divorced and she remarried.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
She has a new husband.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That man would be my stepfather.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All right, so these are all family members.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
When you hear the word step, family members that we have because of divorce.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So stepson, stepdaughter, stepfather, stepmother.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right, and now again, related to the whole divorce thing, the person that you get divorced to is called an ex-wife or an ex-husband.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
All right, so ex, like ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend means previous.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So my ex-wife is someone I was married to before, or in the case of a woman, my ex-husband was someone I was married to before, but we got divorced, so we're not married now.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's exactly it.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So, and it only applies to husband and wife, right?

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You don't say my ex-children or my ex-mother-in-law.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, because your children are always your children.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
All right.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If you talk about your ex-wife's parents, you just say my ex-wife's father or my ex-wife's mother because there's no more in law.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There's no law.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're not married.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Right.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And lastly, now we have an uncle, but just not any uncle.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But we have our great uncle.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Great uncle.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So they actually explain this in the dialogue.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They say, he is my grandmother's brother.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So my uncle, this is simple.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
My uncle is my mother's brother or my father's brother, easy.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But my great uncle is one of my grandparents' brothers.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Right.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So my grandmother's brother or my grandfather's brother.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Right.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In English, we don't distinguish.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We don't say a different word for grandmother's brother or grandfather's brother.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Right.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Exactly.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So your great uncle could be either your grandmother's brother or your grandfather's brother.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's right.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So in my family, I have, well, I just have one great uncle and one great aunt.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
My grandmother has a sister, so I have a great aunt and my grandfather has a brother.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So I have a great uncle.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And now the prefix great can also be applied, for example, to grandparents.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So you can say my great grandfather.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's right.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So we're talking about generations.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I have a grandfather, but his father is my great grandfather.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That means we go back in the past one more generation.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's right.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
All right.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So let's take a break and let's listen to the dialogue again.

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What are you doing this weekend?

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
My brother-in-law is having a small get together at his house and he invited me.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Is it a family thing or just friends?

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
A bit of both.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Some cousins, aunts, and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there?

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He is really funny.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You mean your sister?

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he's my grandmother's brother.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You lost me.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll explain later.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's go.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
All right.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We're back.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So we've picked out three key phrases for you.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Fluency Builder.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,000
All right.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So on Fluency Builder, we have a great noun here, actually.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You might've heard this before in a different way, but in today's dialogue, we're talking about a small get together.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
My brother-in-law is having a small get together.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Now, what is a get together, Mark?

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Right.

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So as you notice, we say a get together, meaning that get together, we are taking it as a noun.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And it may be confusing because you see the verb get, right?

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And you're thinking it's a verb, but no.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
A get together is a reunion, a meeting.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,000
All right.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,000
A party.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A party.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So maybe it's a very informal party, very casual, not fancy.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A get together, I could say, Marco, I'm having a get together at my apartment.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Do you want to come and bring your girlfriend?

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Right.

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So very simple.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Maybe we have a drink or some food, but it's nothing fancy.

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's right.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Very informal, very casual.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
A get together.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And when we were asking about the get together, we asked if it's a family thing or is it just friends.

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So I want to take a look at this phrase here, a family thing.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is it a family thing?

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What am I asking when I say, okay, Marco, this party you're having, is it a family thing?

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, you're asking if it's a family reunion, a family party.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So that means if I'm not in your family, can I still come?

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Right.

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Because if it's a family thing, it's just for people in my family.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Right.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Right.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If it's for everyone, no problem.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But I don't want to go to your house if it's a family thing because that's private.

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Right.

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Right.

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So usually, for example, maybe Christmas dinner would usually be a family thing you celebrate with your family mostly.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But it's not always a family thing.

160
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's what I could say.

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This year, my birthday is just a family thing.

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm only inviting family members.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Exactly.

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
All right.

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And lastly, we got a little bit confused with the great uncle and the stepson and the ex-wife.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And so we said, you know what?

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You lost me.

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You lost me.

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You lost me.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Now, this is another great phrase.

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The phrase means, I don't understand.

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm confused.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's exactly it.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So if someone is explaining something and I don't understand, then you can say, you know what?

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You lost me.

176
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't understand.

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Right.

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And sometimes I say this when someone is giving a very, very long explanation for something.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So to get to my house, you turn left here and then you go two blocks, you turn right and you go straight and you wait for the stoplight.

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Then you go to the right-hand corner.

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
There's a store.

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I say, wait, wait, wait.

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You lost me.

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Right.

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Exactly.

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't understand.

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm confused.

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
All right.

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So that's all we have.

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What are you doing this weekend?

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
My brother-in-law is having a small get together at his house and he invited me.

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Is it a family thing or just friends?

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
A bit of both.

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Some cousins, aunts and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there?

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He is really funny.

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You mean your sister?

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he's my grandmother's brother.

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You lost me.

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll explain later.

204
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's go.

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So speaking of extended family members, what else can we mention?

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We have a step family, your stepson, your stepdaughter.

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What about if you have an adopted child, would you say, would you differentiate it?

208
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Some people do, some people don't.

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Most people just say, this is my son, this is my daughter.

210
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But I would like to add that with stepson, stepdaughter, it's not just divorce that we have this.

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Also, if the parent, maybe the mother dies and the father has a new wife, then the new wife can say, this is my stepson, this is my stepdaughter.

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So there are two possibilities.

213
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
One is death and one is remarriage because of divorce.

214
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
As far as adopted, no, usually just say my son and my daughter, but I can tell you this.

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If my father and my mother divorce, my father has a new wife, and together they have a baby, the baby boy or girl is my half-brother or half-sister, because we share one parent, my father.

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Right, this is very interesting.

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So if you do have a brother or sister that is not from your same mother or father, but just one parent, then yeah, it's called a half-brother or sister.

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Half, remember this, half because half of their parents are the same as your parents.

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Maybe one father or mother.

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But with stepbrothers and stepsisters, the only reason you're related is because of marriage, not because of blood.

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We didn't mention that you could have a stepbrother, so it's your brother, but he's legally your stepbrother, but he's not related to your father or anyone in your family.

222
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's right, that's right.

223
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So maybe you have many stepbrothers.

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You could have a stepbrother and a half-brother.

225
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So there are lots of different combinations because of many different reasons.

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:47,000
All right, guys, that's all the time we have for today, but it's a little bit of a confusing topic, so if you have any questions or any doubts, you can come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and you can leave them there.

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, we hope to see you guys online, and until next time.

228
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Bye.

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We'll say bye.
