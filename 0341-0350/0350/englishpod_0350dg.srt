00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What are you doing this weekend?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My brother-in-law is having a small get together at his house and he invited me.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Is it a family thing or just friends?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
A bit of both.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Some cousins, aunts, and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He is really funny.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You mean your sister?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he's my grandmother's brother.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You lost me.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll explain later.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's go.
