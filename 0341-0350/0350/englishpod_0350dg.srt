00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,759
What are you doing this weekend?

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,500
My brother-in-law is having a small get together at his house and he invited me.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,759
Is it a family thing or just friends?

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,720
A bit of both.

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:18,140
Some cousins, aunts, and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.

6
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:20,519
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there?

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,800
He is really funny.

8
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,940
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,519
You mean your sister?

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,160
No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he's my grandmother's brother.

11
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:31,719
You lost me.

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:32,700
I'll explain later.

13
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,200
Let's go.
