1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I can't.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I have to go to the gym.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Come on.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You can go tomorrow.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just skip it today.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's not as if you're going to get in trouble.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Actually, I will.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I like it because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's cool.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He makes a workout plan depending on the areas I want to work on or the muscles I want to build.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Like, for example, in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs, and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Then for my quads, calves, and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Sounds like you're really getting into shape.
