1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,980
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight?

2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:08,880
I can't.

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:09,800
I have to go to the gym.

4
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:10,660
Come on.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,400
You can go tomorrow.

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,279
Just skip it today.

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,080
It's not as if you're going to get in trouble.

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,640
Actually, I will.

9
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:18,820
I'm working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go.

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,539
I like it because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,460
That's cool.

12
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,920
Does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,640
Yeah.

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,559
He makes a workout plan depending on the areas I want to work on or the muscles I want to build.

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,619
Like, for example, in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs, and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,119
Then for my quads, calves, and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,479
Sounds like you're really getting into shape.
