00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Catherine and we're going to the gym today, right Marco?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That's right.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today we're going to go to the gym and we're going to try to lose weight or to get in shape.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, before we start out though, there is a phrasal verb that we should take a look at.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So today in vocabulary preview we're looking at this phrase, to work out or working out.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So when we go to the gym, this is what we do.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We go there to work out.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To exercise or to tone up.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is just a way of saying that I'm going to go somewhere like a gym to exercise myself.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, with that in mind, we're going to go to the gym, we're going to work out and we're going to learn a lot of words today about what exactly goes on in the gym.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I can't.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have to go to the gym.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Come on.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You can go tomorrow.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Just skip it today.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's not as if you're going to get in trouble.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Actually, I will.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I like it because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's cool.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He makes a workout plan depending on the areas I want to work on or the muscles I want to build.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Like, for example, in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Then for my quads, calves and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sounds like you're really getting into shape.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
All right.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, now we're back.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's take a look at language takeaway.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
All right.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
First of all, in today's dialogue, we heard a lot about this person called a personal trainer.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What does a personal trainer do, Marco?

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Basically, you have a person that is your coach, the person that guides you and teaches you how to work out or what you should do.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All right.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Personal means it's just for me.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This person is only helping me.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A trainer is someone who, like you say, gives me guidance.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A personal trainer is someone who will work with me every day or maybe one time a week to really get the most out of my workout.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So, that is a personal trainer.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And as we said, he's going to help us to build muscle.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We want to build muscle when we go to the gym.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All right.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, this is an interesting one because the verb is not to grow or to make.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The verb is to build.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, I have muscles, but I want my muscles to get bigger, so I go to build muscles at the gym.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's right.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You might even hear this phrase, a body builder.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, this idea that you make them.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah, exactly.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, you don't get muscle.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You don't create muscle.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You build muscle.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And alongside with muscles, not only do you get them big, but you also get muscle tone.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
All right.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So, muscle tone basically means definition.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, maybe before you start to work out, your body is very soft.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You can't see the muscles.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, when you start to see those muscles, you see the lines in your body.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So, your skin gets tighter, not so soft.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's called muscle tone.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So, then you can see the muscles.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's muscle tone.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And now, the muscles that we most commonly go to the gym to work out, we're going to name really quickly and we're going to see where they are.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So, the first one that we mentioned were abs.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is an important one, especially if you want to go to the beach.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The abs are located on your stomach.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, you see those kind of rectangles, those squares on your stomach.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Those are the abs.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's right.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And now, for guys also, we want to work out our pecs or our pectoral muscles.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So, those are on your chest, below your neck, but above your stomach.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And another important one on your arm, we have our biceps.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Men usually like to show these off, or at least boys do.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
These are on your arms.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So, you know when you make that L shape with your arm and you squeeze like Popeye?

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Those are your biceps.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Those are your biceps.

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Exactly.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And now, obviously going down towards our legs now, we have our quad muscles, our quads.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All right.

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So, those are on the top part of your legs, right Marco?

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
In front.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
In front.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So, like on the top of your thigh.

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Exactly.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And now, right behind the back part of your leg, you have your hamstrings.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hamstring.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now, you hear about this one a lot, because people injure their hamstrings pretty easily in football or in running.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, that's right.

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Sometimes if you're running and you didn't stretch, your muscles are not warm, you can pull a hamstring.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
All right.

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, that hamstring is an important one.

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But we have one more.

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's right.

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We have our calves, and these are in the bottom, right above our feet.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So, I don't have any muscles except for this one, because I ride my bike.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And when you ride your bike, this gets big.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So, your calves are that part of your leg above your foot, but below your knee in the back.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's right.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The back part.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Very good.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So, all of these muscles, some of the most common ones that we work out.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So, now let's move on to some important phrases on Fluency Builder.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight?

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I can't.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I have to go to the gym.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Come on.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You can go tomorrow.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Just skip it today.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's not as if you're going to get in trouble.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Actually, I will.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go.

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I like it, because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's cool.

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah.

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He makes a workout plan depending on the areas I want to work on, or the muscles I want to build.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Like, for example, in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs, and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights.

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Then, for my quads, calves, and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Sounds like you're really getting into shape.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So, at the beginning of the dialogue, the friends were trying to decide what to do, and one friend said, Do you want to go catch a movie?

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right.

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, to catch a movie.

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Do you want to go catch a movie?

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It sounds funny, because, you know, catch means to hold something in your hands after someone throws it.

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right.

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So, throw and catch.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But here, it doesn't mean to actually hold something in your hands.

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It means, do you want to go see a movie?

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Right.

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Exactly.

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, it's a very informal, colloquial way of saying, Hey, do you want to go to the movies?

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Do you want to go see a movie?

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Maybe not like a, yeah, serious date or something.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Just for fun.

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you want to go catch a movie?

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's right.

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's go catch a movie.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
All right.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So, obviously, we can't go to the movies, because we got to go to the gym.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And we have to go to the gym, because our personal trainer will get on our case.

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The personal trainer will get on my case if I don't go.

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
All right.

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So, someone will get on my case if I don't do this.

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So, this is an interesting way of saying, My personal trainer will criticize me or will be angry with me if I don't do this.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's right.

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So, you can use it with, for example, your parents.

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Your parents are always getting on your case because you don't clean your room.

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
My mom gets on my case when I don't tell her where I'm going when I go out.

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So, that means to criticize, to give you a hard time to get angry at you or even maybe yell at you.

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But you can change the pronoun.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So, he gets on my case, but I can get on your case.

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's right.

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Right.

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So, just remember that someone gets on someone else's case.

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's where the person goes.

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And, of course, if you want to tell that person to stop bothering you, you just say, Get off my case.

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
All right.

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So, he's on her case.

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Get off my case.

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's right.

173
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And now, to finish things off, the whole reason why we're going to the gym is because we want to get in shape.

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
All right.

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Great phrase here, to get in shape.

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is something a lot of people like to do in the new year.

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So, they say, Okay, it's a new year.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I want a new body.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm going to get in shape.

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That means I will lose weight, build some muscle, and start to feel good.

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's right.

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So, we want to get in shape.

183
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Very good.

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight?

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I can't.

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I have to go to the gym.

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Come on.

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You can go tomorrow.

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Just skip it today.

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's not as if you're going to get in trouble.

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Actually, I will.

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I like it because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's cool.

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?

197
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah.

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He makes a workout plan depending on the areas I want to work on or the muscles I want to build.

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Like, for example, in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs, and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights.

200
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Then, for my quads, calves, and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Sounds like you're really getting into shape.

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
All right.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So going to the gym, getting a personal trainer, what do you think?

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is it a good idea or a bad idea?

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I think for some people who have a hard time getting motivated, so people who don't like to go to the gym, it's a great idea.

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Because having another person push you can really help.

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I think for other people who are already pushing themselves, it's not as helpful.

208
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think also if you just start out going to the gym, I think you should get a personal trainer for the first couple of weeks.

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because you really have to understand and learn what you're doing and the purpose of that exercise and figure out how many sets, how many repetitions.

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
All this is very important because some people just go and they overwork it.

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
They do, and they don't know how to use the machines or the weights.

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And you can actually harm yourself.

213
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You can pull a hamstring or something if you don't know what you're doing.

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So for people who've never learned how to exercise, maybe it's a good idea like you say.

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Well, it's a very interesting thing.

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Actually, gyms as well, very popular nowadays, especially with the holidays passing.

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
People gain some holiday weight.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You've got to go back to the gym to lose that weight.

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's right.

220
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So let us know.

221
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you go to the gym?

222
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If so, what parts of your body do you like to focus on?

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
