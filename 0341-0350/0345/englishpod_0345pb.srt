00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:03,240
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:03,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,960
My name is Catherine and we're going to the gym today, right Marco?

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:07,700
That's right.

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,519
Today we're going to go to the gym and we're going to try to lose weight or to get in shape.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,940
So, before we start out though, there is a phrasal verb that we should take a look at.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,980
So today in vocabulary preview we're looking at this phrase, to work out or working out.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,899
That's right.

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,039
So when we go to the gym, this is what we do.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,780
We go there to work out.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,759
To exercise or to tone up.

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,640
This is just a way of saying that I'm going to go somewhere like a gym to exercise myself.

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,460
That's right.

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:47,859
So, with that in mind, we're going to go to the gym, we're going to work out and we're going to learn a lot of words today about what exactly goes on in the gym.

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,259
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight?

16
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,179
I can't.

17
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,060
I have to go to the gym.

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,960
Come on.

19
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:58,679
You can go tomorrow.

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,560
Just skip it today.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,359
It's not as if you're going to get in trouble.

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,899
Actually, I will.

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,099
I'm working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go.

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,819
I like it because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,719
That's cool.

26
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,200
Does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:13,900
Yeah.

28
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,799
He makes a workout plan depending on the areas I want to work on or the muscles I want to build.

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,900
Like, for example, in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights.

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,420
Then for my quads, calves and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,780
Sounds like you're really getting into shape.

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,480
All right.

33
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:35,519
So, now we're back.

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,480
Let's take a look at language takeaway.

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,159
All right.

36
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,000
First of all, in today's dialogue, we heard a lot about this person called a personal trainer.

37
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,019
What does a personal trainer do, Marco?

38
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:59,500
Basically, you have a person that is your coach, the person that guides you and teaches you how to work out or what you should do.

39
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,159
All right.

40
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,180
Personal means it's just for me.

41
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,900
This person is only helping me.

42
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,780
A trainer is someone who, like you say, gives me guidance.

43
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:16,919
A personal trainer is someone who will work with me every day or maybe one time a week to really get the most out of my workout.

44
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,479
That's right.

45
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,500
So, that is a personal trainer.

46
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,759
And as we said, he's going to help us to build muscle.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,719
We want to build muscle when we go to the gym.

48
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:26,120
All right.

49
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,699
So, this is an interesting one because the verb is not to grow or to make.

50
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,520
The verb is to build.

51
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,919
So, I have muscles, but I want my muscles to get bigger, so I go to build muscles at the gym.

52
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,699
That's right.

53
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,199
You might even hear this phrase, a body builder.

54
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,400
So, this idea that you make them.

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,580
Yeah, exactly.

56
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,819
So, you don't get muscle.

57
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:49,219
You don't create muscle.

58
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,439
You build muscle.

59
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,860
And alongside with muscles, not only do you get them big, but you also get muscle tone.

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:56,659
All right.

61
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,000
So, muscle tone basically means definition.

62
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,039
So, maybe before you start to work out, your body is very soft.

63
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,379
You can't see the muscles.

64
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:10,960
Well, when you start to see those muscles, you see the lines in your body.

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,120
So, your skin gets tighter, not so soft.

66
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,439
That's called muscle tone.

67
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,199
That's right.

68
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,979
So, then you can see the muscles.

69
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,860
That's muscle tone.

70
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:24,319
And now, the muscles that we most commonly go to the gym to work out, we're going to name really quickly and we're going to see where they are.

71
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,759
So, the first one that we mentioned were abs.

72
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:27,479
Okay.

73
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,000
This is an important one, especially if you want to go to the beach.

74
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,199
The abs are located on your stomach.

75
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,639
So, you see those kind of rectangles, those squares on your stomach.

76
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:39,580
Those are the abs.

77
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,300
That's right.

78
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,219
And now, for guys also, we want to work out our pecs or our pectoral muscles.

79
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,979
So, those are on your chest, below your neck, but above your stomach.

80
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:51,780
That's right.

81
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,539
And another important one on your arm, we have our biceps.

82
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:56,400
All right.

83
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,240
Men usually like to show these off, or at least boys do.

84
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,000
These are on your arms.

85
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,099
So, you know when you make that L shape with your arm and you squeeze like Popeye?

86
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,060
Those are your biceps.

87
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,099
Those are your biceps.

88
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:08,719
Exactly.

89
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,840
And now, obviously going down towards our legs now, we have our quad muscles, our quads.

90
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,439
All right.

91
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:17,560
So, those are on the top part of your legs, right Marco?

92
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,500
In front.

93
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,279
In front.

94
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,939
So, like on the top of your thigh.

95
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:21,980
Exactly.

96
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:29,579
And now, right behind the back part of your leg, you have your hamstrings.

97
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:30,899
Hamstring.

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,379
Now, you hear about this one a lot, because people injure their hamstrings pretty easily in football or in running.

99
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,240
Yeah, that's right.

100
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,860
Sometimes if you're running and you didn't stretch, your muscles are not warm, you can pull a hamstring.

101
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:44,439
All right.

102
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,980
So, that hamstring is an important one.

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,740
But we have one more.

104
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:47,579
That's right.

105
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,720
We have our calves, and these are in the bottom, right above our feet.

106
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,500
So, I don't have any muscles except for this one, because I ride my bike.

107
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,100
And when you ride your bike, this gets big.

108
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,600
So, your calves are that part of your leg above your foot, but below your knee in the back.

109
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,279
That's right.

110
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,139
The back part.

111
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,199
Very good.

112
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,240
So, all of these muscles, some of the most common ones that we work out.

113
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,279
So, now let's move on to some important phrases on Fluency Builder.

114
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,759
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight?

115
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,680
I can't.

116
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,540
I have to go to the gym.

117
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,459
Come on.

118
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:24,160
You can go tomorrow.

119
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,060
Just skip it today.

120
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,860
It's not as if you're going to get in trouble.

121
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:28,379
Actually, I will.

122
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,579
I'm working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go.

123
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,319
I like it, because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.

124
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,220
That's cool.

125
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,699
Does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?

126
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,399
Yeah.

127
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,300
He makes a workout plan depending on the areas I want to work on, or the muscles I want to build.

128
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,399
Like, for example, in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs, and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights.

129
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,899
Then, for my quads, calves, and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

130
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,259
Sounds like you're really getting into shape.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,740
So, at the beginning of the dialogue, the friends were trying to decide what to do, and one friend said, Do you want to go catch a movie?

132
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,579
That's right.

133
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:09,379
So, to catch a movie.

134
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,439
Do you want to go catch a movie?

135
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,439
It sounds funny, because, you know, catch means to hold something in your hands after someone throws it.

136
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:15,759
Right.

137
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,139
So, throw and catch.

138
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:21,540
But here, it doesn't mean to actually hold something in your hands.

139
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,980
It means, do you want to go see a movie?

140
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,399
Right.

141
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:26,060
Exactly.

142
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,240
So, it's a very informal, colloquial way of saying, Hey, do you want to go to the movies?

143
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,560
Do you want to go see a movie?

144
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:34,420
Maybe not like a, yeah, serious date or something.

145
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,060
Just for fun.

146
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,220
Do you want to go catch a movie?

147
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,899
That's right.

148
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:37,819
Let's go catch a movie.

149
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,399
All right.

150
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,319
So, obviously, we can't go to the movies, because we got to go to the gym.

151
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,939
And we have to go to the gym, because our personal trainer will get on our case.

152
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:50,420
The personal trainer will get on my case if I don't go.

153
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,040
All right.

154
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,439
So, someone will get on my case if I don't do this.

155
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:04,959
So, this is an interesting way of saying, My personal trainer will criticize me or will be angry with me if I don't do this.

156
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,680
That's right.

157
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,139
So, you can use it with, for example, your parents.

158
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,740
Your parents are always getting on your case because you don't clean your room.

159
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:12,660
Yeah.

160
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,459
My mom gets on my case when I don't tell her where I'm going when I go out.

161
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,959
So, that means to criticize, to give you a hard time to get angry at you or even maybe yell at you.

162
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,019
But you can change the pronoun.

163
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,579
So, he gets on my case, but I can get on your case.

164
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,180
That's right.

165
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:31,339
Right.

166
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,819
So, just remember that someone gets on someone else's case.

167
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,079
That's where the person goes.

168
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,319
And, of course, if you want to tell that person to stop bothering you, you just say, Get off my case.

169
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,040
All right.

170
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,319
So, he's on her case.

171
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
Get off my case.

172
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,660
That's right.

173
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:52,920
And now, to finish things off, the whole reason why we're going to the gym is because we want to get in shape.

174
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:53,660
All right.

175
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,420
Great phrase here, to get in shape.

176
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:58,379
This is something a lot of people like to do in the new year.

177
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,680
So, they say, Okay, it's a new year.

178
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,699
I want a new body.

179
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm going to get in shape.

180
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,199
That means I will lose weight, build some muscle, and start to feel good.

181
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,839
That's right.

182
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,319
So, we want to get in shape.

183
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,060
Very good.

184
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,680
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

185
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,000
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight?

186
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:21,920
I can't.

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,800
I have to go to the gym.

188
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:23,680
Come on.

189
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,420
You can go tomorrow.

190
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,300
Just skip it today.

191
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,120
It's not as if you're going to get in trouble.

192
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,639
Actually, I will.

193
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,839
I'm working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go.

194
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,600
I like it because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.

195
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,480
That's cool.

196
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,940
Does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?

197
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:39,659
Yeah.

198
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,559
He makes a workout plan depending on the areas I want to work on or the muscles I want to build.

199
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:50,659
Like, for example, in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs, and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights.

200
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,139
Then, for my quads, calves, and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

201
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,519
Sounds like you're really getting into shape.

202
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:00,620
All right.

203
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,799
So going to the gym, getting a personal trainer, what do you think?

204
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,960
Is it a good idea or a bad idea?

205
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:11,980
I think for some people who have a hard time getting motivated, so people who don't like to go to the gym, it's a great idea.

206
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,639
Because having another person push you can really help.

207
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,399
I think for other people who are already pushing themselves, it's not as helpful.

208
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:28,840
I think also if you just start out going to the gym, I think you should get a personal trainer for the first couple of weeks.

209
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:38,480
Because you really have to understand and learn what you're doing and the purpose of that exercise and figure out how many sets, how many repetitions.

210
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:43,360
All this is very important because some people just go and they overwork it.

211
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,000
They do, and they don't know how to use the machines or the weights.

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,740
And you can actually harm yourself.

213
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,259
You can pull a hamstring or something if you don't know what you're doing.

214
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:58,379
So for people who've never learned how to exercise, maybe it's a good idea like you say.

215
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,240
Well, it's a very interesting thing.

216
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:05,220
Actually, gyms as well, very popular nowadays, especially with the holidays passing.

217
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,259
People gain some holiday weight.

218
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,159
You've got to go back to the gym to lose that weight.

219
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,740
That's right.

220
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,460
So let us know.

221
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,440
Do you go to the gym?

222
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,080
If so, what parts of your body do you like to focus on?

223
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,960
