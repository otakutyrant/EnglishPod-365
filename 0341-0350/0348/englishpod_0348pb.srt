00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're going to a very special place, Marco, a place where men and women alike, but usually women are associated with it, and these women like to go.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What is this place we're going to?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we are going to a beauty spa.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
All right.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So let's check that out in today's vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All right.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So this place, a beauty spa, it's interesting because it's not just a normal spa.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's a particular spa where you get treated for some things.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's right.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So a beauty spa is a place where you go to feel good.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So women and men like to have their nails and their faces and their skin taken care of, maybe their makeup and hair as well.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So it's not just a place where you maybe go for a massage, but you get a lot of other services that make your skin nice, make you look and feel good.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
All right.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So that's where we're going today.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're going to go to a beauty spa and we're going to talk about all the different things that you can do there.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the very first time.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You want to go get a facial with me today?

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Dude, what are you talking about?

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Only girls do that.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Not at all.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
There's nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
True.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So what should they do to you at your beauty spa?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, you should come with me one day.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sure you'll love it.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Uh, no.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
All right, we're back.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So now let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Language Takeaway.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Got a lot of great phrases and words in Language Takeaway today.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The first one, though, is from the very first line of dialogue.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You want to go get a facial with me today?

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's right.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We are asking our friend if he wants to go with us to go get a facial.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now what exactly does it mean to get a facial?

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All right, a facial here is a thing, in this case, a service that we would pay for.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And basically, a facial is just a skincare treatment or a treatment for your face.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So maybe you'll get some cream and cleansing and, you know, in the advertisements, you often see someone getting a facial with like cucumbers on their eyes.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And so it's just a way to make your skin feel really good, particularly on your face.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes, your face.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And the verb here is to get.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So I'm going to get a facial or I got a facial yesterday.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
OK, very good.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now apart from getting a facial, getting a special treatment on your face, you can also get a manicure and a pedicure.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's right.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So manicure, pedicure, these we're going to keep together because they're very similar, but they're a little bit different.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Manny, manicure, manny, that means something to do with the hands.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So manicure is actually when you have your fingernails kind of cleaned and taken care of, and then they will apply some paint, so nail polish.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So basically having your nails treated and then colored.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
OK.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And then pedicure, I imagine, is the same thing, but for your feet.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's right.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Petty refers to feet.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So pedicure is the same treatment, the same service, but for your toes.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
In this case, you'd have very, you know, nice nail polish on your toes.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
All right.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Now going back to skin treatment, because manicure and pedicure are for your fingernails and for your hands and feet, we are talking about getting your face exfoliated, or he says, well, first they exfoliate my face.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So exfoliate, you think ex means taking something away.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In this case, to exfoliate means to take the dead skin away, and sometimes this can be a little bit painful because you think at first you have some dry skin, some dead skin.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They have to take it away.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They have to use something rough.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can do it on your feet as well, but when they exfoliate your face, they use some kind of cleanser or some kind of maybe sponge to clear the dead skin, and then afterwards you have the fresh new skin, and it's very smooth and nice looking.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
OK.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So that's what it means to exfoliate the skin.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It can be on your face, your feet, pretty much anywhere in your body.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And lastly, we also are just using sunscreen during the day to protect our skin and to keep it healthy.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's right.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So sunscreen is a kind of cream.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Do you use sunscreen, Marco?

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, you don't have to.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, I often use sunscreen because I'm very, very pale, and so when I go in the sun, maybe at the beach, it's very easy for me to burn my skin, to turn red, and so sunscreen helps me protect my skin.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So that's exactly what it does.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sunscreen is a specific type of lotion that you put on your skin, and it prevents you from getting sunburns or from darkening your skin.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's right.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So those are the words we have relating to skincare and some of these services at the beauty spa, but we've got some more phrases for you.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So let's first listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back in a moment.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You want to go get a facial with me today?

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Dude, what are you talking about?

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Only girls do that.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Not at all.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There's nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
True.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So what should they do to you at your beauty spa?

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin.

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, you should come with me one day.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sure you'll love it.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Uh, no.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
All right, so now it's time for some fluency builder.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's check out three key phrases.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Fluency builder.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So, we've got this first phrase here, not at all.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So one person says only girls go to the beauty spa and what does the other person say?

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Right.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He says, no, not at all.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Not at all.

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So basically he's responding by saying, no, that's not true.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Now you could have said no, but why do you say not at all?

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Because say no, but no is almost rude.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Not at all is a way to say, actually, in reality, this is different.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So it's a more polite way of disagreeing with what the person just said.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay, so you can say no, not at all.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I guess you can say both, right?

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Not at all or together.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No, not at all.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No, not at all.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You could say, women don't like to watch football.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And you can say, oh, not at all.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You could say only men like to watch football.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Right, and then if I disagree or you say actually, I can say no, not at all.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Actually girls like to watch football as well.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's right.

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay, so now continuing on with the skincare topic, we saw this interesting verb, to apply some moisturizer.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So the verb here is to apply something on your skin.

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
All right, so the verb to apply means to put on, okay, or to use.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And this is a verb we often use with beauty care products, like apply the shampoo to your head or apply some fingernail polish.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It means that you're going to, yeah, to put it on yourself.

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Right, so when we say apply some moisturizer is to use moisturizer.

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah, to put it on your skin.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Like I apply my makeup, that means I put the makeup on my skin.

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So in this case, moisturizer is a great cream that we use when our skin is dry and we want it to be more healthy, we want it to be less dry, and we add this.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay, and lastly, after you exfoliate, you apply moisturizer, you do everything, he says that you leave the beauty salon feeling like a million bucks.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
All right, to feel like a million bucks, this is a phrase that we often use to say you feel wonderful.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You feel great.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You feel really good, and so this is the main reason to go to the beauty spa, right Marco?

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Right, so you go there because you want to feel like a million bucks, so you feel very, very, very good.

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Sometimes when I buy a new outfit and I try it on, I'm really excited, I say, oh, I feel like a million bucks.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So I guess the other form of this word will actually be you look like a million bucks.

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Someone can look like a million bucks.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Exactly, so I see my friend coming from the beauty spa and I say, wow, you look like a million bucks.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You look great.

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
All right, so let's listen to our dialogue one last time, let's review everything, and we'll be back in a bit.

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You want to go get a facial with me today?

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Dude, what are you talking about?

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Only girls do that.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Not at all.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
There's nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
True.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So what should they do to you at your beauty spa?

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin.

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young.

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in.

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Well, you should come with me one day.

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sure you'll love it.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Uh, no.

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:00,000
All right, so facials, this sort of thing is commonly mostly associated with women, but as we saw in the dialogue, more and more men are actually taking care of their skin and their appearance.

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's right.

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So while this might have been traditionally a woman's event, going to the spa, having a girl's day at the spa, you're right Marco, a lot of men like to do this.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Just because you get a manicure doesn't mean you have to have pink fingernails.

168
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You can actually just have your nails taken care of and cleaned and cut and your cuticles taken care of.

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So it feels really nice.

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's right.

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Actually, it's a common new trend that we've even heard in the news about.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And the term that men are labeled with when they take excessive care of their skin and their appearance, they say they're metrosexuals.

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Metrosexual.

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Right.

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Now this is a man who, like you say, likes to dress nicely, takes care of his hair, has nice skin.

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Someone who really takes care of their body.

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And it's different from being a homosexual, for example, where maybe that's a stereotype that we have.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Where we say, oh well, some people who are homosexual like to dress very well and take care of their skin.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Metrosexual people, men, are straight, they're not gay, but they still like to do these things, to go to the spa or to take care of their appearances.

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So it's a very interesting topic, specifically nowadays, where this type of thing is more and more common, and yet still, in many places and cultures, it's very much taboo.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Obviously, being manly, man-associated with that is, you know, you don't really take care of your appearance.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You know, you wake up and you still look kind of messy and half asleep, or, you know, guy has scars and beards and stuff, so you don't really associate it much.

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But it's very interesting to see these types of different cultural aspects, so we would like to know if in your culture, your country, this is a common practice.

184
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Is it acceptable or is it very, very rare?

185
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And if you go to the beauty spa, whether you're a man or a woman, what's your favorite service?

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Do you like the facials?

187
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you like the pedicures?

188
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
