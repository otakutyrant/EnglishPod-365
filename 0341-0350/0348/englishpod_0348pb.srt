00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,620
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,379
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:13,359
My name is Catherine, and today we're going to a very special place, Marco, a place where men and women alike, but usually women are associated with it, and these women like to go.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,919
What is this place we're going to?

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,380
That's right.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,719
Today we are going to a beauty spa.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,399
All right.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,140
So let's check that out in today's vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,440
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:24,579
All right.

11
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:29,460
So this place, a beauty spa, it's interesting because it's not just a normal spa.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,700
It's a particular spa where you get treated for some things.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,539
That's right.

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,179
So a beauty spa is a place where you go to feel good.

15
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:45,960
So women and men like to have their nails and their faces and their skin taken care of, maybe their makeup and hair as well.

16
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:55,560
So it's not just a place where you maybe go for a massage, but you get a lot of other services that make your skin nice, make you look and feel good.

17
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:55,979
All right.

18
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:57,060
So that's where we're going today.

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,200
We're going to go to a beauty spa and we're going to talk about all the different things that you can do there.

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,140
So let's listen to our dialogue for the very first time.

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,599
You want to go get a facial with me today?

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,400
Dude, what are you talking about?

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,540
Only girls do that.

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,540
Not at all.

25
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,319
Guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures.

26
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:21,079
There's nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.

27
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:21,640
True.

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,340
So what should they do to you at your beauty spa?

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,319
Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young.

31
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,079
Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.

32
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,560
That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in.

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,519
In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.

34
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,200
Well, you should come with me one day.

35
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,760
I'm sure you'll love it.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,780
Uh, no.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,079
All right, we're back.

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,379
So now let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,680
Language Takeaway.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,920
Got a lot of great phrases and words in Language Takeaway today.

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,640
The first one, though, is from the very first line of dialogue.

42
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,260
You want to go get a facial with me today?

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:07,859
That's right.

44
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,900
We are asking our friend if he wants to go with us to go get a facial.

45
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,699
Now what exactly does it mean to get a facial?

46
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,159
All right, a facial here is a thing, in this case, a service that we would pay for.

47
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,280
And basically, a facial is just a skincare treatment or a treatment for your face.

48
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:37,360
So maybe you'll get some cream and cleansing and, you know, in the advertisements, you often see someone getting a facial with like cucumbers on their eyes.

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,180
And so it's just a way to make your skin feel really good, particularly on your face.

50
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:42,900
Yes, your face.

51
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:44,800
And the verb here is to get.

52
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:49,080
So I'm going to get a facial or I got a facial yesterday.

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,300
OK, very good.

54
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:58,460
Now apart from getting a facial, getting a special treatment on your face, you can also get a manicure and a pedicure.

55
00:02:58,939 --> 00:02:59,240
That's right.

56
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,539
So manicure, pedicure, these we're going to keep together because they're very similar, but they're a little bit different.

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,300
Manny, manicure, manny, that means something to do with the hands.

58
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:18,979
So manicure is actually when you have your fingernails kind of cleaned and taken care of, and then they will apply some paint, so nail polish.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,939
So basically having your nails treated and then colored.

60
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:23,699
OK.

61
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,240
And then pedicure, I imagine, is the same thing, but for your feet.

62
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,020
That's right.

63
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,879
Petty refers to feet.

64
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:34,659
So pedicure is the same treatment, the same service, but for your toes.

65
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,680
In this case, you'd have very, you know, nice nail polish on your toes.

66
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:39,479
All right.

67
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:55,659
Now going back to skin treatment, because manicure and pedicure are for your fingernails and for your hands and feet, we are talking about getting your face exfoliated, or he says, well, first they exfoliate my face.

68
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,520
So exfoliate, you think ex means taking something away.

69
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:11,460
In this case, to exfoliate means to take the dead skin away, and sometimes this can be a little bit painful because you think at first you have some dry skin, some dead skin.

70
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,520
They have to take it away.

71
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,419
They have to use something rough.

72
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:30,660
You can do it on your feet as well, but when they exfoliate your face, they use some kind of cleanser or some kind of maybe sponge to clear the dead skin, and then afterwards you have the fresh new skin, and it's very smooth and nice looking.

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,259
OK.

74
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,660
So that's what it means to exfoliate the skin.

75
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,160
It can be on your face, your feet, pretty much anywhere in your body.

76
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,759
And lastly, we also are just using sunscreen during the day to protect our skin and to keep it healthy.

77
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:46,860
That's right.

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,800
So sunscreen is a kind of cream.

79
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,000
Do you use sunscreen, Marco?

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,800
No.

81
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,959
No, you don't have to.

82
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:04,699
Well, I often use sunscreen because I'm very, very pale, and so when I go in the sun, maybe at the beach, it's very easy for me to burn my skin, to turn red, and so sunscreen helps me protect my skin.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,319
So that's exactly what it does.

84
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:15,199
Sunscreen is a specific type of lotion that you put on your skin, and it prevents you from getting sunburns or from darkening your skin.

85
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:15,959
That's right.

86
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:23,360
So those are the words we have relating to skincare and some of these services at the beauty spa, but we've got some more phrases for you.

87
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,379
So let's first listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back in a moment.

88
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,019
You want to go get a facial with me today?

89
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,779
Dude, what are you talking about?

90
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,920
Only girls do that.

91
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:36,939
Not at all.

92
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,699
Guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures.

93
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,459
There's nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.

94
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,019
True.

95
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,720
So what should they do to you at your beauty spa?

96
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,399
Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin.

97
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:52,699
Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young.

98
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:56,480
Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.

99
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,959
That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in.

100
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:03,920
In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.

101
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,600
Well, you should come with me one day.

102
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sure you'll love it.

103
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,220
Uh, no.

104
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:13,480
All right, so now it's time for some fluency builder.

105
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,180
Let's check out three key phrases.

106
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,839
Fluency builder.

107
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,720
So, we've got this first phrase here, not at all.

108
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:27,420
So one person says only girls go to the beauty spa and what does the other person say?

109
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:27,800
Right.

110
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:29,180
He says, no, not at all.

111
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,399
Not at all.

112
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:34,920
So basically he's responding by saying, no, that's not true.

113
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,579
Now you could have said no, but why do you say not at all?

114
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,319
Because say no, but no is almost rude.

115
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,300
Not at all is a way to say, actually, in reality, this is different.

116
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,920
So it's a more polite way of disagreeing with what the person just said.

117
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,920
Okay, so you can say no, not at all.

118
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,560
I guess you can say both, right?

119
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:59,519
Not at all or together.

120
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,879
No, not at all.

121
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,019
No, not at all.

122
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,019
You could say, women don't like to watch football.

123
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,939
And you can say, oh, not at all.

124
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,300
You could say only men like to watch football.

125
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,079
Right, and then if I disagree or you say actually, I can say no, not at all.

126
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,379
Actually girls like to watch football as well.

127
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,019
That's right.

128
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:27,040
Okay, so now continuing on with the skincare topic, we saw this interesting verb, to apply some moisturizer.

129
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,339
So the verb here is to apply something on your skin.

130
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,939
All right, so the verb to apply means to put on, okay, or to use.

131
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:45,639
And this is a verb we often use with beauty care products, like apply the shampoo to your head or apply some fingernail polish.

132
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,220
It means that you're going to, yeah, to put it on yourself.

133
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:55,600
Right, so when we say apply some moisturizer is to use moisturizer.

134
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,779
Yeah, to put it on your skin.

135
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,060
Like I apply my makeup, that means I put the makeup on my skin.

136
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:10,199
So in this case, moisturizer is a great cream that we use when our skin is dry and we want it to be more healthy, we want it to be less dry, and we add this.

137
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:21,339
Okay, and lastly, after you exfoliate, you apply moisturizer, you do everything, he says that you leave the beauty salon feeling like a million bucks.

138
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,759
All right, to feel like a million bucks, this is a phrase that we often use to say you feel wonderful.

139
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:28,720
You feel great.

140
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,240
You feel really good, and so this is the main reason to go to the beauty spa, right Marco?

141
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,620
Right, so you go there because you want to feel like a million bucks, so you feel very, very, very good.

142
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:45,539
Sometimes when I buy a new outfit and I try it on, I'm really excited, I say, oh, I feel like a million bucks.

143
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:50,840
So I guess the other form of this word will actually be you look like a million bucks.

144
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,399
Someone can look like a million bucks.

145
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,779
Exactly, so I see my friend coming from the beauty spa and I say, wow, you look like a million bucks.

146
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,919
You look great.

147
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:04,419
All right, so let's listen to our dialogue one last time, let's review everything, and we'll be back in a bit.

148
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,919
You want to go get a facial with me today?

149
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,759
Dude, what are you talking about?

150
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:13,860
Only girls do that.

151
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:14,879
Not at all.

152
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,659
Guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures.

153
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,419
There's nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.

154
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:20,980
True.

155
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,679
So what should they do to you at your beauty spa?

156
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:27,360
Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin.

157
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,700
Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young.

158
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,440
Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.

159
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,960
That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in.

160
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,860
In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.

161
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,559
Well, you should come with me one day.

162
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,120
I'm sure you'll love it.

163
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,120
Uh, no.

164
00:09:48,759 --> 00:10:00,860
All right, so facials, this sort of thing is commonly mostly associated with women, but as we saw in the dialogue, more and more men are actually taking care of their skin and their appearance.

165
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:01,919
That's right.

166
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:10,659
So while this might have been traditionally a woman's event, going to the spa, having a girl's day at the spa, you're right Marco, a lot of men like to do this.

167
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,440
Just because you get a manicure doesn't mean you have to have pink fingernails.

168
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:20,580
You can actually just have your nails taken care of and cleaned and cut and your cuticles taken care of.

169
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,940
So it feels really nice.

170
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,480
That's right.

171
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,100
Actually, it's a common new trend that we've even heard in the news about.

172
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:39,200
And the term that men are labeled with when they take excessive care of their skin and their appearance, they say they're metrosexuals.

173
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,500
Metrosexual.

174
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:40,960
Right.

175
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:48,399
Now this is a man who, like you say, likes to dress nicely, takes care of his hair, has nice skin.

176
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,379
Someone who really takes care of their body.

177
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:58,919
And it's different from being a homosexual, for example, where maybe that's a stereotype that we have.

178
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:05,960
Where we say, oh well, some people who are homosexual like to dress very well and take care of their skin.

179
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:16,019
Metrosexual people, men, are straight, they're not gay, but they still like to do these things, to go to the spa or to take care of their appearances.

180
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:28,279
So it's a very interesting topic, specifically nowadays, where this type of thing is more and more common, and yet still, in many places and cultures, it's very much taboo.

181
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:37,639
Obviously, being manly, man-associated with that is, you know, you don't really take care of your appearance.

182
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:50,720
You know, you wake up and you still look kind of messy and half asleep, or, you know, guy has scars and beards and stuff, so you don't really associate it much.

183
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:59,679
But it's very interesting to see these types of different cultural aspects, so we would like to know if in your culture, your country, this is a common practice.

184
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,740
Is it acceptable or is it very, very rare?

185
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:09,139
And if you go to the beauty spa, whether you're a man or a woman, what's your favorite service?

186
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,299
Do you like the facials?

187
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,299
Do you like the pedicures?

188
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,919
