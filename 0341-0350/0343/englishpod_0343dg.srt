00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:10,099
EnglishPod.com This is such a nice restaurant.

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,480
I feel so classy.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,140
Yeah, it's a little bit pricey, but they serve the best seafood in town.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,620
May I take your order?

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,940
Yes, I would like some marinated grilled shrimp for starters, and I'll also have the lobster.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,820
Excellent choice, sir.

7
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,179
And for you, madame?

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,660
I would like the baked oysters and the seafood platter.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,160
Very good, madame.

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,280
That seafood platter sounds good.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,299
Excuse me, what does the platter have?

12
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:40,899
It's a great combination of clams, scallops, mussels, calamari, and filet of salmon and tuna.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,679
It comes with a side of butter sauce and french fries.

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,259
That sounds great.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,340
Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same, please.

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,460
Very well, sir.

17
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,460
Anything to drink?

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,560
Can we get a bottle of your house-wiped wine, please?

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,960
Superb choice.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,880
I will be back shortly with the wine.
