00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
EnglishPod.com This is such a nice restaurant.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I feel so classy.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah, it's a little bit pricey, but they serve the best seafood in town.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
May I take your order?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes, I would like some marinated grilled shrimp for starters, and I'll also have the lobster.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Excellent choice, sir.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And for you, madame?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I would like the baked oysters and the seafood platter.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Very good, madame.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That seafood platter sounds good.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Excuse me, what does the platter have?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's a great combination of clams, scallops, mussels, calamari, and filet of salmon and tuna.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It comes with a side of butter sauce and french fries.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That sounds great.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same, please.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Very well, sir.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Anything to drink?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Can we get a bottle of your house-wiped wine, please?

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Superb choice.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I will be back shortly with the wine.
