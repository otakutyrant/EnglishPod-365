00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine and we're here talking about some special foods today.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today we're going to talk about seafood.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So everything that comes from the sea that we eat.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we're in a restaurant and we're going to hear about the different options this restaurant offers.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's take a listen to the dialogue.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is such a nice restaurant.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I feel so classy.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, it's a little bit pricey, but they serve the best seafood in town.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
May I take your order?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, I would like some marinated grilled shrimp for starters and I'll also have the lobster.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Excellent choice, sir.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And for you, madame?

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I would like the baked oysters and the seafood platter.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Very good, madame.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That seafood platter sounds good.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Excuse me, what does the platter have?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's a great combination of clams, scallops, mussels, calamari and filet of salmon and tuna.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It comes with a side of butter sauce and french fries.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That sounds great.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same, please.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Very well, sir.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Anything to drink?

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Can we get a bottle of your house wipe wine, please?

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Superb choice.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will be back shortly with the wine.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Alright, we're back.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, today we're going to take a look at a lot of vocab.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, we're going to have two parts of language takeaway and let's start with the first one.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Language takeaway.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now, in language takeaway part one today, we have a number of really important and useful adjectives.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The first one is classy.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's right.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So, we're going to a nice restaurant and so you feel like you're in a classy place.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now, a classy place is a nice place.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You might be expected to dress nicely.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It might be a little bit fancy.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Exactly.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So, classy is kind of a synonym of fancy or luxurious.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Right.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So, if you're going on a date with someone, it might be a good idea to go to a classy restaurant.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's right.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But usually, if a restaurant is classy, it also means that it's a little bit pricey.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So, something that is pricey is expensive and seafood is famous in America for being very pricey.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's right.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So, something that is pricey means that it's a little bit expensive.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now, going to the food that we're going to get today, we had a couple of different ways of describing how the food was prepared.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So, for example, the first one is marinated grilled shrimp.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Alright.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now, something that is marinated is covered in a sauce or a liquid before it's cooked.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Alright.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So, you can have maybe a regular steak, but you can also have a marinated steak which would be marinated in some kind of flavor like garlic or yogurt.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's right.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So, usually, you leave it in maybe some sauce like garlic sauce for a couple of hours or a couple of minutes before you cook it.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now, when we cook it, there are different ways of cooking things.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In this case, we're having grilled shrimp.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Alright.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now, grilled is different from fried.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Fried, we do in a pan with some oil, but a grill, usually, there's no pan, no oil.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There's just a grill.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, grill, grilled.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Grill is the tool that we use.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Grilled food tends to be quite healthy.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
There's very little oil.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's a bit more dry.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And oftentimes, we do grilling outside because there's lots of smoke.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Because usually, you have like maybe a barbecue and you have some charcoal in there or some wood.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's what you use to cook the food with.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And grilled food is very easy to notice because there are usually black lines on top and bottom.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's from the grill.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So, we ordered marinated grilled shrimp for starters.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So, what is a starter?

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Well, think about the word.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Starter.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Start.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Now, a starter is something you eat at the start of your meal, at the beginning.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You eat it before you eat the main course.

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So, it's also known as an appetizer.

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Starters and appetizers are the same thing.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And these are small things you eat before you start to eat your main meal.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So, they're not very filling.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So, yeah.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It'll be something small like a soup or maybe like in this case, a marinated grilled shrimp.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Alright.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So, great vocab there.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why don't we review that part and we'll be back in a bit.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is such a nice restaurant.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I feel so classy.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's a little bit pricey but they serve the best seafood in town.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
May I take your order?

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I would like some marinated grilled shrimp for starters and I'll also have the lobster.

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Excellent choice, sir.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And for you, madame?

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I would like the baked oysters and the seafood platter.

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Very good, madame.

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That seafood platter sounds good.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Excuse me.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What does the platter have?

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a great combination of clams, scallops, mussels, calamari and filet of salmon and tuna.

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It comes with a side of butter sauce and french fries.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That sounds great.

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same, please.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Very well, sir.

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Anything to drink?

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Can we get a bottle of your house-wiped wine, please?

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Superb choice.

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will be back shortly with the wine.

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Alright, so now let's take a look at all of the exquisite types of seafood that we have here on Language Takeaway Part 2.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Alright, now the first thing we have in Language Takeaway Part 2 is a very distinctive animal from the ocean.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's bright red and it has two claws.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Right.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We're talking about a lobster.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now, lobsters you don't find everywhere.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
In fact, there are some parts of America where they're very famous for their lobster, like mane.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Now, these are animals that are hard on the outside and soft and white on the inside and they're quite difficult to eat.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's right.

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So, they look kind of like crabs because they also have the claws and everything, but they're a lot longer, right?

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's right.

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A crab is round and a lobster is long.

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And lobsters are also famous for one part, for their tails.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The tails are full of meat.

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
They're very delicate, very delicious.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So, we're having some lobster and we also ordered some baked oysters.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Now, oysters are another kind of thing that comes from the ocean.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They come in a shell, alright?

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And you might hear about oysters because some people, some restaurants like to have an oyster bar where they serve raw oysters over ice.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's right.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So, they look like big rocks, basically.

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And when you open them inside, you have meat.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And actually, I think you get pearls from oysters, right?

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's right.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So, these two are special.

148
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They have a nice relationship.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The pearl forms inside, grows inside of the oyster.

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Very good.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So, now we've taken a look at some oysters and talking about these things that have shells, we also have clams.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Now, while oysters are big and sometimes quite shiny, clams are smaller, usually white or gray.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And they have lines on them and they're shells that you open up and you eat the meat from inside.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Right.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So, I guess if you've ever been on the beach and you're collecting little seashells, usually those are kind of like clams.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's right.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
They're quite small.

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They can be about the size of an American quarter, 25 cents.

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay.

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So, now in this seafood platter that we're ordering, we have clams, we have scallops.

161
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Ooh, scallops are one of my favorite kinds of seafood.

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They're quite soft and chewy and they're usually white.

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay.

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And then we have some mussels also.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Now, mussels are much different looking.

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
They're also in shells, but they're long and the shells are black.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's right.

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So, clams are kind of small and round.

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The oysters are pretty big and look like rocks.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Mussels, on the other hand, are long and black.

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And when you open them inside, they're shiny also.

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
They're orange on the inside, or yellow, and so they're quite interesting looking.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But they're also very famous for the French, or Belgian rather, the Belgian dish moules frites, which is a nice specialty.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
All right.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And lastly, we are also having some calamari in this seafood platter.

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, this is another one of my favorites.

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Now, calamari is a kind of food, but the animal is the squid.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay.

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So, why is it called calamari?

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Well, calamari, I believe, comes from the Italian word calamaro.

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Calamari means that it's squid that's been cooked so that people can eat it.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay.

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So, basically, calamari and squid are the same thing.

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They are the same animal, but calamari means that it's prepared to eat.

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes, and usually it's fried.

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So, when squid is fried, it becomes hard, chewy, and that's what calamari tastes like.

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's quite chewy.

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
All right.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Great stuff.

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So, why don't we review everything one last time with this exquisite lesson.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is such a nice restaurant.

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I feel so classy.

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, it's a little bit pricey, but they serve the best seafood in town.

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
May I take your order?

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes, I would like some marinated grilled shrimp for starters, and I'll also have the lobster.

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Excellent choice, sir.

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And for you, madame?

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I would like the baked oysters and the seafood platter.

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Very good, madame.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That seafood platter sounds good.

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Excuse me, what does the platter have?

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's a great combination of clams, scallops, mussels, calamari, and filet of salmon and tuna.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It comes with a side of butter sauce and french fries.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That sounds great.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same, please.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Very well, sir.

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Anything to drink?

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Can we get a bottle of your house-wiped wine, please?

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Superb choice.

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I will be back shortly with the wine.

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
All right.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So, seafood, we said, usually has the connotation of being a little bit pricey.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Why do you think that is?

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I think it's pricey because the best seafood doesn't come from seafood farms.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It comes from people who go in boats and they collect the seafood in nets.

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And also, there are fewer and fewer places now in America where you can find this kind of food because some places have experienced overfishing.

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Too many people are trying to fish.

218
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And also, some places just don't have the right climate for certain animals.

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Right.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So, for example, in the United States, you do have, well, the whole country is covered in the West Coast by the Pacific Ocean.

221
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The East Coast, you have the Atlantic.

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So, obviously, you do have some coasts, but if you're in the middle of the United States, it's probably hard to get seafood.

223
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So, I imagine it's very expensive.

224
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It can be very, very expensive.

225
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So, oftentimes, we get lake food.

226
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's a different kind of fish, but we don't have lobsters.

227
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But you'll find that in the West, you get very good salmon because Alaska in the Northwest is very famous for salmon from the Pacific.

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And in the East, it's very famous for lobster and crab, which are delicious.

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Now, even though it's famous for lobster and crab, it's still relatively expensive compared to other dishes.

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Like, for example, I think a lobster, how much would a lobster dinner cost?

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
A lobster dinner could cost you $150.

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Right, and you're getting almost the same amount of meat as maybe having a steak that would be $20.

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, less meat, I think.

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But we have more cows than we have lobsters.

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Exactly.

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And also, lobsters are famous for being pretty expensive.

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's a very fancy meal to have lobsters.

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Exactly.

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So, it's very interesting, and actually, some countries, seafood is very, very inexpensive.

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Some communities or some countries or communities that fish or have, for example, shrimp farms, it's very inexpensive.

241
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So, it's such a treat to be able to go there and have seafood all you want and not have to spend $300 on a meal.

242
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It is indeed, and it's really nice to be able to get these big prawns, these big shrimp or lobsters and eat them without worrying about the price.

243
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But I'm curious, in your country, do you have seafood, and if so, what kind?

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Is it cheap?

245
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Is it expensive?

246
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is it pricey?

247
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let us know.
