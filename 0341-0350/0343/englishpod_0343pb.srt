00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,439
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,660
My name is Catherine and we're here talking about some special foods today.

4
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:09,179
That's right.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,060
Today we're going to talk about seafood.

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,220
So everything that comes from the sea that we eat.

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:14,800
That's right.

8
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,280
So we're in a restaurant and we're going to hear about the different options this restaurant offers.

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,579
Let's take a listen to the dialogue.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,339
This is such a nice restaurant.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,699
I feel so classy.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,399
Yeah, it's a little bit pricey, but they serve the best seafood in town.

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,859
May I take your order?

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,200
Yes, I would like some marinated grilled shrimp for starters and I'll also have the lobster.

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,039
Excellent choice, sir.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,420
And for you, madame?

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,899
I would like the baked oysters and the seafood platter.

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,420
Very good, madame.

19
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,520
That seafood platter sounds good.

20
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:54,539
Excuse me, what does the platter have?

21
00:00:54,979 --> 00:01:01,140
It's a great combination of clams, scallops, mussels, calamari and filet of salmon and tuna.

22
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,920
It comes with a side of butter sauce and french fries.

23
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,480
That sounds great.

24
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:07,579
Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same, please.

25
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:08,700
Very well, sir.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,700
Anything to drink?

27
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,780
Can we get a bottle of your house wipe wine, please?

28
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:14,180
Superb choice.

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,120
I will be back shortly with the wine.

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,280
Alright, we're back.

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,719
So, today we're going to take a look at a lot of vocab.

32
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:28,819
So, we're going to have two parts of language takeaway and let's start with the first one.

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,019
Language takeaway.

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,079
Now, in language takeaway part one today, we have a number of really important and useful adjectives.

35
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,739
The first one is classy.

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,640
That's right.

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,019
So, we're going to a nice restaurant and so you feel like you're in a classy place.

38
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,959
Now, a classy place is a nice place.

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,620
You might be expected to dress nicely.

40
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,359
It might be a little bit fancy.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,439
Exactly.

42
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,099
So, classy is kind of a synonym of fancy or luxurious.

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,260
Right.

44
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,120
So, if you're going on a date with someone, it might be a good idea to go to a classy restaurant.

45
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:05,939
That's right.

46
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,840
But usually, if a restaurant is classy, it also means that it's a little bit pricey.

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,879
Okay.

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,979
So, something that is pricey is expensive and seafood is famous in America for being very pricey.

49
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,719
That's right.

50
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,520
So, something that is pricey means that it's a little bit expensive.

51
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:32,060
Now, going to the food that we're going to get today, we had a couple of different ways of describing how the food was prepared.

52
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,139
So, for example, the first one is marinated grilled shrimp.

53
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:36,900
Alright.

54
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,539
Now, something that is marinated is covered in a sauce or a liquid before it's cooked.

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,379
Alright.

56
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:54,479
So, you can have maybe a regular steak, but you can also have a marinated steak which would be marinated in some kind of flavor like garlic or yogurt.

57
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,460
That's right.

58
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:03,439
So, usually, you leave it in maybe some sauce like garlic sauce for a couple of hours or a couple of minutes before you cook it.

59
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,580
Now, when we cook it, there are different ways of cooking things.

60
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,919
In this case, we're having grilled shrimp.

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Alright.

62
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,639
Now, grilled is different from fried.

63
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,560
Fried, we do in a pan with some oil, but a grill, usually, there's no pan, no oil.

64
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,900
There's just a grill.

65
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:20,919
So, grill, grilled.

66
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,960
Grill is the tool that we use.

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,479
Grilled food tends to be quite healthy.

68
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,439
There's very little oil.

69
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,419
It's a bit more dry.

70
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,599
And oftentimes, we do grilling outside because there's lots of smoke.

71
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,020
That's right.

72
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:38,400
Because usually, you have like maybe a barbecue and you have some charcoal in there or some wood.

73
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,280
That's what you use to cook the food with.

74
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:40,599
Yeah.

75
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:46,159
And grilled food is very easy to notice because there are usually black lines on top and bottom.

76
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,139
That's from the grill.

77
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:47,780
That's right.

78
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,759
So, we ordered marinated grilled shrimp for starters.

79
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,219
So, what is a starter?

80
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,659
Well, think about the word.

81
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,400
Starter.

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,400
Start.

83
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,500
Now, a starter is something you eat at the start of your meal, at the beginning.

84
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,520
You eat it before you eat the main course.

85
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:03,219
Alright.

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,139
So, it's also known as an appetizer.

87
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:05,740
That's right.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,439
Starters and appetizers are the same thing.

89
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,099
And these are small things you eat before you start to eat your main meal.

90
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,419
So, they're not very filling.

91
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,419
Okay.

92
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,120
So, yeah.

93
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:19,319
It'll be something small like a soup or maybe like in this case, a marinated grilled shrimp.

94
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:19,740
Yes.

95
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:20,519
Alright.

96
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,040
So, great vocab there.

97
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,899
Why don't we review that part and we'll be back in a bit.

98
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:34,660
This is such a nice restaurant.

99
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,000
I feel so classy.

100
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:36,759
Yeah.

101
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,699
It's a little bit pricey but they serve the best seafood in town.

102
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,160
May I take your order?

103
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,360
Yes.

104
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,480
I would like some marinated grilled shrimp for starters and I'll also have the lobster.

105
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Excellent choice, sir.

106
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,740
And for you, madame?

107
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,199
I would like the baked oysters and the seafood platter.

108
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:54,720
Very good, madame.

109
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,839
That seafood platter sounds good.

110
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,660
Excuse me.

111
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:58,839
What does the platter have?

112
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:05,459
It's a great combination of clams, scallops, mussels, calamari and filet of salmon and tuna.

113
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,339
It comes with a side of butter sauce and french fries.

114
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:09,800
That sounds great.

115
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,879
Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same, please.

116
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,000
Very well, sir.

117
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,000
Anything to drink?

118
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,100
Can we get a bottle of your house-wiped wine, please?

119
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,480
Superb choice.

120
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:20,439
I will be back shortly with the wine.

121
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:33,259
Alright, so now let's take a look at all of the exquisite types of seafood that we have here on Language Takeaway Part 2.

122
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,660
Alright, now the first thing we have in Language Takeaway Part 2 is a very distinctive animal from the ocean.

123
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,560
It's bright red and it has two claws.

124
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,259
Right.

125
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,040
We're talking about a lobster.

126
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,459
Now, lobsters you don't find everywhere.

127
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,160
In fact, there are some parts of America where they're very famous for their lobster, like mane.

128
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:01,120
Now, these are animals that are hard on the outside and soft and white on the inside and they're quite difficult to eat.

129
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,120
That's right.

130
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,319
So, they look kind of like crabs because they also have the claws and everything, but they're a lot longer, right?

131
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:08,800
That's right.

132
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,579
A crab is round and a lobster is long.

133
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,920
And lobsters are also famous for one part, for their tails.

134
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,560
Right.

135
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,339
The tails are full of meat.

136
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,160
They're very delicate, very delicious.

137
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,019
Okay.

138
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,600
So, we're having some lobster and we also ordered some baked oysters.

139
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,339
Now, oysters are another kind of thing that comes from the ocean.

140
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,779
They come in a shell, alright?

141
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:39,000
And you might hear about oysters because some people, some restaurants like to have an oyster bar where they serve raw oysters over ice.

142
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:39,980
That's right.

143
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,779
So, they look like big rocks, basically.

144
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,620
And when you open them inside, you have meat.

145
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,420
And actually, I think you get pearls from oysters, right?

146
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,139
That's right.

147
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,060
So, these two are special.

148
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,160
They have a nice relationship.

149
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,279
The pearl forms inside, grows inside of the oyster.

150
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:54,980
Very good.

151
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:01,339
So, now we've taken a look at some oysters and talking about these things that have shells, we also have clams.

152
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:09,060
Now, while oysters are big and sometimes quite shiny, clams are smaller, usually white or gray.

153
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,259
And they have lines on them and they're shells that you open up and you eat the meat from inside.

154
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:14,680
Right.

155
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,160
So, I guess if you've ever been on the beach and you're collecting little seashells, usually those are kind of like clams.

156
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,360
That's right.

157
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,199
They're quite small.

158
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:26,079
They can be about the size of an American quarter, 25 cents.

159
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:26,920
Okay.

160
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,740
So, now in this seafood platter that we're ordering, we have clams, we have scallops.

161
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:35,180
Ooh, scallops are one of my favorite kinds of seafood.

162
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,279
They're quite soft and chewy and they're usually white.

163
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:40,259
Okay.

164
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,540
And then we have some mussels also.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,819
Now, mussels are much different looking.

166
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:48,379
They're also in shells, but they're long and the shells are black.

167
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:49,279
That's right.

168
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,019
So, clams are kind of small and round.

169
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,600
The oysters are pretty big and look like rocks.

170
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,600
Mussels, on the other hand, are long and black.

171
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,660
And when you open them inside, they're shiny also.

172
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:05,560
They're orange on the inside, or yellow, and so they're quite interesting looking.

173
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,240
But they're also very famous for the French, or Belgian rather, the Belgian dish moules frites, which is a nice specialty.

174
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,040
All right.

175
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,139
And lastly, we are also having some calamari in this seafood platter.

176
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,259
Oh, this is another one of my favorites.

177
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,579
Now, calamari is a kind of food, but the animal is the squid.

178
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,399
Okay.

179
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,120
So, why is it called calamari?

180
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,899
Well, calamari, I believe, comes from the Italian word calamaro.

181
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,159
Calamari means that it's squid that's been cooked so that people can eat it.

182
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:34,720
Okay.

183
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,860
So, basically, calamari and squid are the same thing.

184
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,620
They are the same animal, but calamari means that it's prepared to eat.

185
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,240
Yes, and usually it's fried.

186
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,159
So, when squid is fried, it becomes hard, chewy, and that's what calamari tastes like.

187
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,980
It's quite chewy.

188
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:50,799
All right.

189
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:51,480
Great stuff.

190
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,639
So, why don't we review everything one last time with this exquisite lesson.

191
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,440
This is such a nice restaurant.

192
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,759
I feel so classy.

193
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:10,440
Yeah, it's a little bit pricey, but they serve the best seafood in town.

194
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,919
May I take your order?

195
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,279
Yes, I would like some marinated grilled shrimp for starters, and I'll also have the lobster.

196
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,179
Excellent choice, sir.

197
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:20,500
And for you, madame?

198
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,960
I would like the baked oysters and the seafood platter.

199
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,500
Very good, madame.

200
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:27,600
That seafood platter sounds good.

201
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,620
Excuse me, what does the platter have?

202
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:36,240
It's a great combination of clams, scallops, mussels, calamari, and filet of salmon and tuna.

203
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,059
It comes with a side of butter sauce and french fries.

204
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:40,559
That sounds great.

205
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,639
Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same, please.

206
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:43,799
Very well, sir.

207
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,759
Anything to drink?

208
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,860
Can we get a bottle of your house-wiped wine, please?

209
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,259
Superb choice.

210
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,240
I will be back shortly with the wine.

211
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,860
All right.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,820
So, seafood, we said, usually has the connotation of being a little bit pricey.

213
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,799
Why do you think that is?

214
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:07,340
I think it's pricey because the best seafood doesn't come from seafood farms.

215
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,500
It comes from people who go in boats and they collect the seafood in nets.

216
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:20,779
And also, there are fewer and fewer places now in America where you can find this kind of food because some places have experienced overfishing.

217
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,559
Too many people are trying to fish.

218
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,519
And also, some places just don't have the right climate for certain animals.

219
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:26,820
Right.

220
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:34,519
So, for example, in the United States, you do have, well, the whole country is covered in the West Coast by the Pacific Ocean.

221
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,340
The East Coast, you have the Atlantic.

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,759
So, obviously, you do have some coasts, but if you're in the middle of the United States, it's probably hard to get seafood.

223
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,299
So, I imagine it's very expensive.

224
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,960
It can be very, very expensive.

225
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:51,000
So, oftentimes, we get lake food.

226
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,679
It's a different kind of fish, but we don't have lobsters.

227
00:10:53,679 --> 00:11:02,440
But you'll find that in the West, you get very good salmon because Alaska in the Northwest is very famous for salmon from the Pacific.

228
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,240
And in the East, it's very famous for lobster and crab, which are delicious.

229
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:15,399
Now, even though it's famous for lobster and crab, it's still relatively expensive compared to other dishes.

230
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,259
Like, for example, I think a lobster, how much would a lobster dinner cost?

231
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,220
A lobster dinner could cost you $150.

232
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:27,759
Right, and you're getting almost the same amount of meat as maybe having a steak that would be $20.

233
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,419
Yeah, less meat, I think.

234
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,940
But we have more cows than we have lobsters.

235
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:32,360
Exactly.

236
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,919
And also, lobsters are famous for being pretty expensive.

237
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,220
It's a very fancy meal to have lobsters.

238
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:38,679
Exactly.

239
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:47,480
So, it's very interesting, and actually, some countries, seafood is very, very inexpensive.

240
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:55,279
Some communities or some countries or communities that fish or have, for example, shrimp farms, it's very inexpensive.

241
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,419
So, it's such a treat to be able to go there and have seafood all you want and not have to spend $300 on a meal.

242
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:10,519
It is indeed, and it's really nice to be able to get these big prawns, these big shrimp or lobsters and eat them without worrying about the price.

243
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,379
But I'm curious, in your country, do you have seafood, and if so, what kind?

244
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:15,919
Is it cheap?

245
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,700
Is it expensive?

246
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:17,440
Is it pricey?

247
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:18,679
Let us know.
