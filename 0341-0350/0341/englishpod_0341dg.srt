EnglishPod.com Do I have to use the whisk, or can I use the electric mixer?

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed.

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm going to sift the flour and baking powder separately, and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay, so now we need a baking pan, right?

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, but grease and flour at first, so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Done!

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So how long do we bake it for?

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We can leave it in there for about 25 minutes, then we let it cool for 10 minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wow, this is a lot easier than I thought!
