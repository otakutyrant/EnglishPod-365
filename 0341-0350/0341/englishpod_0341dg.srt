EnglishPod.com Do I have to use the whisk, or can I use the electric mixer?

2
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,359
Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed.

00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,820
I'm going to sift the flour and baking powder separately, and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients.

4
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,460
Okay, so now we need a baking pan, right?

5
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,939
Yeah, but grease and flour at first, so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes.

6
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:51,799
Done!

7
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,840
So how long do we bake it for?

8
00:00:54,219 --> 00:01:00,039
We can leave it in there for about 25 minutes, then we let it cool for 10 minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,880
Wow, this is a lot easier than I thought!
