00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,720
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,740
My name is Catherine and today EnglishPod is in the kitchen.

4
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:07,400
That's right.

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,380
Today we are going to hit the kitchen and we're going to bake a cake.

6
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:18,839
Alright, so check out this dialogue first and when we come back we'll be talking about some very key phrases and words for cooking in English.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,120
Okay, so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake?

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,739
Almost.

9
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,260
Let me just put my apron on.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,200
Okay, so the first thing we're going to do is preheat the oven.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,640
That way we have it at the desired temperature once we've finished preparing everything.

12
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,640
Set it to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.

13
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:40,659
Got it.

14
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,479
Now we're going to make the batter.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,140
Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,960
Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.

17
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,679
Do I have to use the whisk or can I use the electric mixer?

18
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,759
Go ahead and use the mixer but put it on medium speed.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,240
I'm going to sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients.

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,840
Okay, so now we need a baking pan, right?

21
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,359
Yeah, but grease and flour at first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes.

22
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:10,519
Done.

23
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,260
So how long do we bake it for?

24
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,159
We can leave it in there for about 25 minutes.

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,459
Then we let it cool for 10 minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,340
Wow, this is a lot easier than I thought.

27
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:25,540
Alright, we're back.

28
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,700
So now let's take a look at some of those keywords on language takeaway.

29
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,239
Language takeaway.

30
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,599
Well, first of all, we have a special thing to keep our clothes clean while we are cooking.

31
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,500
What is this thing called, Marco?

32
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,140
This is called an apron.

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,140
An apron.

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,719
An apron.

35
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:45,200
So it's not actually a shirt.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:54,120
It's a piece of fabric that you would maybe tie around your waist or around your neck to protect your clothes from flour and butter and oil.

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,780
That's right.

38
00:01:54,859 --> 00:02:04,219
So it's very common to wear an apron while you're cooking or maybe while you're cleaning the house or the kitchen in order to avoid getting dirty, like you say.

39
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:13,120
And so we're going to start baking our cake and the first thing that we do is we turn on the oven in order to have it at the desired temperature.

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,580
Now this is something you might see in a recipe.

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,360
It says the desired temperature is 450 degrees.

42
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,759
So that means the temperature you want to achieve.

43
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,759
Maybe when you turn the oven on, it's only 100 degrees.

44
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:27,099
Right.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,360
So you have to wait for the desired temperature, which is what is indicated in the recipe.

46
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:32,219
That's right.

47
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,379
So this is what we want.

48
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,139
We want the desired temperature of 375 degrees.

49
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:42,280
And so now we got that done and now we're going to make the batter.

50
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,120
All right.

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,680
The batter is the liquid.

52
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,360
It's the cake before the cake becomes a cake.

53
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:55,419
So it's usually like a very thick liquid, like a very thick, almost buttery, milky substance.

54
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,419
And after you cook it, it turns hard.

55
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,300
So batter is the liquid form.

56
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,000
Right.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,800
So when you're making a cake, you make batter.

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,360
Now it's different because if you're making pizza or you're making bread, it's not called batter.

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,080
No.

60
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,400
If you're making pizza or bread, because those are thicker, they're called dough.

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:13,879
Dough.

62
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,419
But when it's still like milk, you know, or water, it's like a liquid, we call it a batter.

63
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,120
A batter.

64
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:19,699
Very good.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,360
So obviously to make the batter, we add sugar, we add butter, we add eggs.

66
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,580
And then what we want to do is we want to mix it.

67
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,319
And so the other person asks, well, what do I do?

68
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,219
Do I have to use a whisk or an electric mixer?

69
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:33,740
All right.

70
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,199
These are two very important tools that you will find in most kitchens.

71
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:42,939
A whisk is like a spoon, but it's made of metal and it's empty inside.

72
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,439
And we use it for things like eggs or milk and sugar.

73
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,539
And it can go very, very quickly.

74
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:54,039
It makes a sound like a sound like wire all around it.

75
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,319
Yeah.

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,120
It's wire that's woven together.

77
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,199
And so it's a very, very handy tool.

78
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,300
But you only use one hand to to use it.

79
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,740
But an electric mixer is what the name says.

80
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,539
It's electric.

81
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:08,439
You plug it in and it does the whisking automatically.

82
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,419
That's right.

83
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,340
All right.

84
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,439
So this is what we want to use.

85
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:21,939
And before we put the batter into the baking pan, what we want to do first is we want to grease and flour the sides of the baking pan.

86
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,759
So then, you know, it won't stick.

87
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,800
All right.

88
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:33,300
So to grease something means to use oil or butter to to make sure that the meat or the dough does not stick later.

89
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,759
That's right.

90
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:40,680
So you can even use it for obviously in cooking terms, if you put butter or something like this.

91
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,439
But even grease like the black grease, maybe you need to put it in your door because maybe it's making that weird sound.

92
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:48,920
Right.

93
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,959
So to grease something is to add oil or to add butter in order to, you know, keep something from sticking.

94
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:55,800
That's right.

95
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:56,360
OK.

96
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,139
So a lot of words there.

97
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:01,100
Now, why don't we pass on to some phrases.

98
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,279
Let's start with some fluency builder.

99
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,180
Fluency builder.

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,160
Now, at the beginning of the dialogue, we talked about the oven.

101
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,560
The real phrase you're going to see in a cookbook is preheat the oven.

102
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,259
That's right.

103
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,579
So we have the prefix there pre to preheat something.

104
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,279
And that means to begin or to start heating.

105
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:27,040
Now, this is because when I turn my oven on right, Marco, it's not 450 degrees.

106
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,500
It takes some time to become hot.

107
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,540
So we preheat the oven.

108
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,720
We turn it on before we need it in order to make sure it's ready when we do need it.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,600
That's right.

110
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,259
So you're going to see it in every recipe.

111
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,199
If you're baking something, you need to preheat the oven.

112
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:52,980
And now, when we were actually mixing some of the things, we came up on this interesting phrase when we said we need to sift the flour and the baking powder.

113
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:53,899
All right.

114
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,360
Now, these are both white substances.

115
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,439
They're soft.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,060
They're dry.

117
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,779
And sometimes they are bumpy.

118
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,019
They have lumps in them.

119
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,779
So we need to make sure that there are no lumps.

120
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,660
And we have a special tool that will help us sift the flour and sift the baking powder.

121
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,500
So it's like a wire mesh tool.

122
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,899
And you rotate the handle, you turn the handle, and it will flatten out this flour so that there are no more bumps.

123
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,079
It's all smooth.

124
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:23,699
OK.

125
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,399
I think I've heard it also when they're talking about gold, right?

126
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,360
Don't they say that they were sifting for gold in the rivers?

127
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,899
That's right.

128
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:38,060
Well, you have a tray, and you shake the tray to make sure the small gold falls down, but the big chunks stay on top.

129
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,319
That's the same idea, yeah.

130
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:39,920
OK.

131
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,779
So that's what we're doing here.

132
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,240
We're sifting the flour and the baking powder.

133
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:51,079
And now we put our cake in the oven, and we ask, well, so how long do we bake it for?

134
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,920
And we say, well, we can leave it in there for about 25 minutes.

135
00:06:55,739 --> 00:07:01,399
So the phrase here, to leave it in, means to keep the cake in the oven.

136
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,839
And this is something we can say about a lot of things.

137
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,500
So maybe the turkey that we're cooking is in the oven.

138
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,339
It's been in the oven for four hours, and I look at it, and I say, is it ready yet?

139
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,040
My mom says, no, leave it in.

140
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:13,199
Leave it in, yeah.

141
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,639
So that means don't take it out.

142
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680
Keep it in the oven.

143
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,360
Leave it in.

144
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:16,379
Right.

145
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,000
So we don't really need to say, leave it inside the oven, or we don't need to be too specific.

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,399
We can just say, leave it in.

147
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,519
Keep it cooking.

148
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,360
Keep it cooking.

149
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:25,860
That's right.

150
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,399
OK.

151
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,000
So let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

152
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,319
OK.

153
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,100
So are you ready to learn how to bake a cake?

154
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:37,779
Almost.

155
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,199
Let me just put my apron on.

156
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:41,019
OK.

157
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,199
So the first thing we're going to do is preheat the oven.

158
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,620
That way, we have it at the desired temperature once we've finished preparing everything.

159
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:49,620
Set it to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.

160
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:50,620
Got it.

161
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,480
Now we're going to make the batter.

162
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,620
Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency.

163
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,939
Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.

164
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,639
Do I have to use the whisk, or can I use the electric mixer?

165
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:06,779
Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed.

166
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,220
I'm going to sift the flour and baking powder separately, and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients.

167
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,000
OK.

168
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,819
So now we need a baking pan, right?

169
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,339
Yeah, but grease and flour at first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes.

170
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:20,100
Done.

171
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,259
So how long do we bake it for?

172
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:25,120
We can leave it in there for about 25 minutes.

173
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,420
Then we let it cool for 10 minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.

174
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,379
Wow.

175
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,339
This is a lot easier than I thought.

176
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,159
So baking a cake seems easy enough.

177
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:42,159
Now maybe there are some other things that we can add that we didn't mention.

178
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,860
Like, for example, vanilla extract.

179
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,039
It's mentioned in the recipe.

180
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,419
So that is, what is this?

181
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,360
It's like a liquid, right?

182
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:49,940
It's a liquid.

183
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,679
It's a flavor.

184
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:56,059
And so extracts are used to give different foods flavors.

185
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,159
You can have orange extract and vanilla extract.

186
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,659
And vanillas are actually, it comes from a bean, a brown bean.

187
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:10,019
And they take the oil from this plant, and that's what gives things like cake a vanilla flavor.

188
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,679
And now what about this baking pan?

189
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,120
This is specifically for cakes.

190
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,320
Now what if you're making something like muffins or something like, is it also called like a baking pan?

191
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,159
No, you'd have a muffin tin.

192
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,840
Or a muffin pan, yeah.

193
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,519
And so those are a different shape.

194
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,820
They're round.

195
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,539
They're circular.

196
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:34,559
And they're made of that tin material, so they're not very heavy, and they can go in the oven and not break.

197
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,799
But normally we have a baking sheet, which is flat.

198
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,320
Or a baking pan, which would be for a cake pan.

199
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,100
Something like that.

200
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,139
It's got sides on it.

201
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:48,139
And we have a muffin tin, which is for muffins.

202
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:56,299
And, well, what we didn't mention is we actually have our cake, but then there's something that we always add on top of the cake or all over the cake.

203
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, well not always, but most cakes, at least most tasty cakes, have frosting.

204
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:04,940
So that's something that you add after the cake has finished cooking.

205
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,720
That's right.

206
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,740
So frosting is like a cream or something that you add around the cake.

207
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,480
Actually just sugar and water.

208
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,299
Sugar and water.

209
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:13,120
Oh really?

210
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,299
You can add milk if you want to make it thicker, but when I make frosting, I like to make it from scratch.

211
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,120
That means I make it by myself.

212
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,840
I use water and powdered sugar.

213
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,620
Powdered sugar.

214
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,480
And then you mix it.

215
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:25,840
You mix it, you whisk it.

216
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,700
And then you get the frosting.

217
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,980
Very interesting.

218
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:36,159
And, well, maybe this recipe is actually real, although we didn't give the amounts, the quantities.

219
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,799
But maybe you can try baking a cake and let us know how it goes, or maybe you can give us a cake recipe.

220
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:42,519
That's right.

221
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,279
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

222
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:45,320
We hope to see you guys there.

223
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:45,679
All right.

224
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:45,940
Bye.

225
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:46,360
Bye.
