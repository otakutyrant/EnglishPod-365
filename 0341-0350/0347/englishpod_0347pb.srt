00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're doing something that makes a lot of people very nervous when they come to America.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we are arriving to the airport.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But before we can leave, we need to pass through customs and immigration.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
All right, customs and immigration.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So anyone who comes into the United States, American, not American, doesn't matter.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You have to go through this gate.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So let's learn about some of these phrases and questions in today's dialogue.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Here you are.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes, I have some traveler's checks and two credit cards.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Very good.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Do you have anything to declare?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Nope.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I only have my clothes and camera.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Very well, sir.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Welcome to the United States.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Enjoy your visit.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
All right, we're back.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So now let's take a look at some of that language takeaway.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Language takeaway.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The first thing we have to learn about is the arrival card.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So good afternoon, passport and arrival card, please.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's the first line of the dialogue.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So your arrival card, usually you will get on the airplane before you land.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And basically, you just have to put your name, your passport number, where you're from, and basic information like this that you must give to the immigration officer.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So what is the opposite of arrival card?

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What do you fill out when you leave America?

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's right.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Some countries require you to fill out a departure card.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
All right.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So some countries, not all, but you'll usually get an arrival card, which means that you have to give your name and basic information.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So we are talking to the immigration officer and he asks, is this your country of birth or residence?

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
All right, let's break that down.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Country of birth.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So birth, birthday, that makes me think of where I was born.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So what country were you born in?

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's another way to ask this question.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's right.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So since we said we are coming from China, the immigration officer wants to know if we are Chinese or if we simply live there.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And that's why he says or residence.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So residence, it's a noun, it's a thing.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
My country of residence is the place where I live.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So I'm American, but maybe my country of residence is France because I live in France.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So it's different from your country of birth.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now moving on, when the immigration officer was asking us about money, we said that we have some traveler's checks and two credit cards.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
All right, so credit cards are pretty clear, but what exactly are traveler's checks and how are they different from normal checks?

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So traveler's checks are kind of a convenient way to carry money because you have these little pieces of paper that have a certain amount on them.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So for example, $500 each.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And if you lose it, it's not a problem because no one can exchange those checks for cash unless it's you.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
All right, so my traveler's check, I buy these from the bank.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They have my name on them, my passport number on them.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And to spend them as money, I need to show my passport or proof of identification or proof of identity.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So basically if someone steals my traveler's checks, if I lose my traveler's checks, I don't have to worry because no one else can spend them but me.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Exactly.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They were very, very popular back before credit cards were so popular.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now you don't really see too many traveler's checks, but it's still convenient.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All right, so a lot of language there.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Earth or residence?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I just work there.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What is the purpose of your visit to the United States?

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm here on vacation.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
How long do you plan to stay in the United States?

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Almost three weeks.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Sir, you didn't fill out the information on your arrival card of where you'll be staying.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, I'm sorry, but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United States, so I wasn't sure what to put.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You must specify an address on the place where you will spend most of your time.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Here you are.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Do you have enough means to support yourself while you're here?

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, I have some traveler's checks and two credit cards.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Very good.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Do you have anything to declare?

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Nope.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I only have my clothes and camera.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Very well, sir.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Welcome to the United States.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Enjoy your visit.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
All right, we're back.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So now let's take a look at some of those key questions that the immigration officer asks us on Fluency Builder.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Fluency Builder All right, this first sentence, this first question is actually something that a lot of learners of English have a hard time with.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Where are you coming from?

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Right.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So the immigration officer is sitting there at his desk and you are arriving on an airplane.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So what he wants to know is what country are you arriving from?

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So if I am on a flight from France to America, I say I'm arriving from France.

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm coming from France.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But here's a big thing.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What if he says, where are you from?

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now he's asking you for your nationality.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So then you wouldn't say France because you're not French.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm not French.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm American.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So I'd say I am American, but I'm coming from France.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So this is a very typical question that English learners confuse because as you can see, it's very, very similar, but you just have one word that you add on and it completely changes the question.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So when the immigration officer asks you, where are you coming from?

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You tell them what country you got on the plane.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
All right.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So where did you leave to come to America?

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Did you leave from France, China, Ghana?

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So that's the answer to that question.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Exactly.

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because most of the time immigration officers will never ask you where you are from because they will see your passport.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They know.

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They know.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So, okay.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Now, once we give them our passport, we tell them that we just work in China.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We're not Chinese.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He asks, what is the purpose of your visit to the United States?

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's the purpose of your visit?

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Now purpose means goal or aim.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So there are a couple of standard answers to this question, but basically the immigration officer wants to know, why are you in America?

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why are you coming here?

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So you have a, as Catherine says, a couple of different ways of answering that.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We're saying here that we are here on vacation.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm here on vacation, tourism, tourism business, right?

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Seeing family.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
These are all acceptable answers.

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's right.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So now that we've told the officer all of this information, we actually forgot to fill out our address on our arrival card.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So he says that we must specify an address.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
All right.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So to specify, this is a verb.

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It means to indicate or write down or identify because right now there is no address where we're going to stay.

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So to specify means to basically to tell someone where it is to be exact.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's right.

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So you need to specify an address of where you will be during the time you're in the United States.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It could be a hotel, any place.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Right.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But it can't be like Chicago.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Right.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, it can't be a city.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's got to be an address.

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So 10 South Street, Chicago, Illinois.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's right.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Now we told the immigration officer where we're going to be and he asks a very important question.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Also very, very common.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Do you have enough means to support yourself while you are here?

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So means in this instance means resources or money.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So do you have enough money to pay for your housing, your food?

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's the question.

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So means to support yourself.

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That means can you pay for yourself?

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Who's paying for this trip?

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So this is why we say, yeah, we have some traveler's checks and a couple of credit cards.

155
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And lastly, we also need to answer if we have anything to declare.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But what does this mean to declare what?

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
To declare at customs.

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But we don't normally ask to declare at customs.

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We just say, do you have anything to declare?

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is because normally when we travel to other countries, there are special taxes for certain goods.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:34,000
For example, if I want to come to America and I have three bottles of wine, I have to give one away because I'm only allowed to bring in two bottles.

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Right.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So I have to declare two bottles of wine or money.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm only allowed to bring $10,000.

166
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If I bring $15,000, I have to write that down and say I have this extra money and then I pay tax.

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So basically they will ask you, what are you bringing to America?

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And if there are special things like money or things you will sell or alcohol, cigarettes, you have to declare these.

170
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You have to explain what you're carrying.

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's right.

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So this is a very important question.

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So most of the time, obviously, if you're on tourism, you don't have much to declare.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But maybe like if Catherine says, maybe you are going to buy a house in the United States and you have $20,000 in your luggage, then you need to tell them that.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's right.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So that's called declaring to declare at customs.

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
All right.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So let's take a break and listen to her dialogue one last time.

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Almost three weeks.

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I only have my clothes and camera.

181
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Very well, sir.

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Welcome to the United States.

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Enjoy your visit.

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
All right.

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So when you're arriving to immigration, obviously all these questions are very, very common.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You will be asked.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But when you're arriving there, there are actually two different sections that you have to go to.

188
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Right.

189
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's right.

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There's two different lines.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Maybe many lines, but they'll have a sign on top.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
One says U.S.

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
passports or U.S.

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
passport holders.

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And that means the line for Americans coming home to America.

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But for most people who are traveling to America, they're foreigners.

197
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They have to go to the other line.

198
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So that's non U.S.

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
passport holders.

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's right.

201
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Now, remember that you don't really have to get nervous when you're talking to the immigration officer.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You know, just have to take it easy and just try to answer the questions.

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Most of them will speak a couple of words in many popular languages like Chinese or Spanish or Arabic, because obviously some people that go on holiday to the United States, maybe they don't speak English.

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's right.

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So there's nothing to be worried about.

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
These people are there to make sure that America is safe.

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They want to check the bags.

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
They want to know who's coming into the country.

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And they're just doing their job being basically policing the borders.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Right.

211
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But it's pretty simple.

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The most annoying part of customs for me is waiting in line.

213
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You have so many people arrive at the same time that you can wait in line maybe an hour sometimes.

214
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Sometimes.

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So again, just be honest and I think people will try to understand you if you're having a hard time.

216
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Exactly.

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000

Bye.

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Bye.
