00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,700
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:04,459
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,839
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,400
And today we're doing something that makes a lot of people very nervous when they come to America.

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:11,019
That's right.

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we are arriving to the airport.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,320
But before we can leave, we need to pass through customs and immigration.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,140
All right, customs and immigration.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,039
So anyone who comes into the United States, American, not American, doesn't matter.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,280
You have to go through this gate.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,120
So let's learn about some of these phrases and questions in today's dialogue.

12
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,099
All right, we're back.

13
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,939
So now let's take a look at some of that language takeaway.

14
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,280
The first thing we have to learn about is the arrival card.

15
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,019
So good afternoon, passport and arrival card, please.

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,640
That's the first line of the dialogue.

17
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:52,359
That's right.

18
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,019
So your arrival card, usually you will get on the airplane before you land.

19
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:06,359
And basically, you just have to put your name, your passport number, where you're from, and basic information like this that you must give to the immigration officer.

20
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,080
So what is the opposite of arrival card?

21
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:11,740
What do you fill out when you leave America?

22
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,439
That's right.

23
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,099
Some countries require you to fill out a departure card.

24
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,500
All right.

25
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:23,000
So some countries, not all, but you'll usually get an arrival card, which means that you have to give your name and basic information.

26
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:23,860
That's right.

27
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:31,919
So we are talking to the immigration officer and he asks, is this your country of birth or residence?

28
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:32,580
All right.

29
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,479
Let's break that down.

30
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:35,120
Country of birth.

31
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:41,180
So birth, birthday, that makes me think of where I was born.

32
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,360
So what country were you born in?

33
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,039
That's another way to ask this question.

34
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,780
That's right.

35
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,979
So since we said we are coming from China, the immigration officer wants to know if we are Chinese or if we simply live there.

36
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,479
And that's why he says or residence.

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,879
So residence, it's a noun, it's a thing.

38
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:04,240
My country of residence is the place where I live.

39
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,419
So I'm American, but maybe my country of residence is France because I live in France.

40
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:10,199
That's right.

41
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,620
So it's different from your country of birth.

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:22,719
Now moving on, when the immigration officer was asking us about money, we said that we have some traveler's checks and two credit cards.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,539
All right.

44
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:29,680
So credit cards are pretty clear, but what exactly are traveler's checks and how are they different from normal checks?

45
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:38,800
So traveler's checks are kind of a convenient way to carry money because you have these little pieces of paper that have a certain amount on them.

46
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:40,740
So for example, $500 each.

47
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:48,819
And if you lose it, it's not a problem because no one can exchange those checks for cash unless it's you.

48
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:49,759
All right.

49
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,319
So my traveler's check, I buy these from the bank.

50
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,560
They have my name on them, my passport number on them.

51
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:04,740
And to spend them as money, I need to show my passport or my proof of identification or proof of identity.

52
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:13,419
So basically if someone steals my traveler's checks, if I lose my traveler's checks, I don't have to worry because no one else can spend them but me.

53
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,180
Exactly.

54
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,920
They were very, very popular back before credit cards were so popular.

55
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,439
Now you don't really see too many traveler's checks, but it's still convenient.

56
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:23,600
All right.

57
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,800
So a lot of language there.

58
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,720
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

59
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,240
Earth or residence?

60
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,379
I just work there.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,160
What is the purpose of your visit to the United States?

62
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:46,259
I'm here on vacation.

63
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,079
How long do you plan to stay in the United States?

64
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:50,420
Almost three weeks.

65
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,060
Sir, you didn't fill out the information on your arrival card of where you'll be staying.

66
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:01,060
Oh, I'm sorry, but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United States, so I wasn't sure what to put.

67
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,000
You must specify an address on the place where you will spend most of your time.

68
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,579
Okay.

69
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,699
Here you are.

70
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,759
Do you have enough means to support yourself while you're here?

71
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,339
I have some traveler's checks and two credit cards.

72
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,199
Very good.

73
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,740
Do you have anything to declare?

74
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,360
Nope.

75
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,180
I only have my clothes and camera.

76
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,220
Very well, sir.

77
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:22,920
Welcome to the United States.

78
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,060
Enjoy your visit.

79
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,040
All right, we're back.

80
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,759
So now let's take a look at some of those key questions that the immigration officer asks us on Fluency Builder.

81
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:44,920
Fluency Builder All right, this first sentence, this first question is actually something that a lot of learners of English have a hard time with.

82
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,000
Where are you coming from?

83
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:47,600
Right.

84
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,459
So the immigration officer is sitting there at his desk and you are arriving on an airplane.

85
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,100
So what he wants to know is what country are you arriving from?

86
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:05,360
So if I am on a flight from France to America, I say I'm arriving from France.

87
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,319
I'm coming from France.

88
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:07,959
That's right.

89
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,240
But here's a big thing.

90
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,160
What if he says, where are you from?

91
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,779
Now he's asking you for your nationality.

92
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:17,779
So then you wouldn't say France because you're not French.

93
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:18,620
I'm not French.

94
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,279
I'm American.

95
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,519
So I'd say I am American, but I'm coming from France.

96
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:23,779
Yes.

97
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:36,339
So this is a very typical question that English learners confuse because as you can see, it's very, very similar, but you just have one word that you add on and it completely changes the question.

98
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,399
So when the immigration officer asks you, where are you coming from?

99
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,019
You tell them what country you got on the plane.

100
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,079
All right.

101
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,240
So where did you leave to come to America?

102
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,740
Did you leave from France, China, Ghana?

103
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,879
So that's the answer to that question.

104
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,300
Exactly.

105
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,000
Because most of the time immigration officers will never ask you where you are from because they will see your passport.

106
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,560
They know.

107
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:00,139
They know.

108
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,660
So, okay.

109
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,680
Now, once we give them our passport, we tell them that we just work in China.

110
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,699
We're not Chinese.

111
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,480
He asks, what is the purpose of your visit to the United States?

112
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:15,000
What's the purpose of your visit?

113
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,500
Now purpose means goal or aim.

114
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:25,040
So there are a couple of standard answers to this question, but basically the immigration officer wants to know, why are you in America?

115
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,540
Why are you coming here?

116
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:27,199
That's right.

117
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,759
So you have a, as Catherine says, a couple of different ways of answering that.

118
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,420
We're saying here that we are here on vacation.

119
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,040
I'm here on vacation, tourism, tourism business, right?

120
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,339
Seeing family.

121
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:41,560
These are all acceptable answers.

122
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:42,439
That's right.

123
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:51,939
So now that we've told the officer all of this information, we actually forgot to fill out our address on our arrival card.

124
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:55,579
So he says that we must specify an address.

125
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,399
All right.

126
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,779
So to specify, this is a verb.

127
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:06,980
It means to indicate or write down or identify because right now there is no address where we're going to stay.

128
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,819
So to specify means to basically to tell someone where it is to be exact.

129
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,720
That's right.

130
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:19,899
So you need to specify an address of where you will be during the time you're in the United States.

131
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:21,420
It could be a hotel, any place.

132
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:21,600
Right.

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,220
But it can't be like Chicago.

134
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:23,680
Right.

135
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,879
No, it can't be a city.

136
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,959
It's got to be an address.

137
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,019
So 10 South Street, Chicago, Illinois.

138
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:30,779
That's right.

139
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:38,019
Now we told the immigration officer where we're going to be and he asks a very important question.

140
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,500
Also very, very common.

141
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,240
Do you have enough means to support yourself while you are here?

142
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,279
So means in this instance means resources or money.

143
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,019
So do you have enough money to pay for your housing, your food?

144
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:53,840
That's the question.

145
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,100
So means to support yourself.

146
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,639
That means can you pay for yourself?

147
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,879
Who's paying for this trip?

148
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,899
So this is why we say, yeah, we have some traveler's checks and a couple of credit cards.

149
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,059
And lastly, we also need to answer if we have anything to declare.

150
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,039
But what does this mean to declare what?

151
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,980
To declare at customs.

152
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:14,480
Okay.

153
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,639
But we don't normally ask to declare at customs.

154
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,860
We just say, do you have anything to declare?

155
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,980
This is because normally when we travel to other countries, there are special taxes for certain goods.

156
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:34,899
For example, if I want to come to America and I have three bottles of wine, I have to give one away because I'm only allowed to bring in two bottles.

157
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:35,399
Right.

158
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,580
So I have to declare two bottles of wine or money.

159
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,019
I'm only allowed to bring $10,000.

160
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,480
If I bring $15,000, I have to write that down and say I have this extra money and then I pay tax.

161
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:46,980
Right.

162
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,700
So basically they will ask you, what are you bringing to America?

163
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:58,980
And if there are special things like money or things you will sell or alcohol, cigarettes, you have to declare these.

164
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,639
You have to explain what you're carrying.

165
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,379
That's right.

166
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,240
So this is a very important question.

167
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:07,120
So most of the time, obviously, if you're on tourism, you don't have much to declare.

168
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:15,360
But maybe like if Catherine says, maybe you are going to buy a house in the United States and you have $20,000 in your luggage, then you need to tell them that.

169
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,019
That's right.

170
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:19,500
So that's called declaring to declare at customs.

171
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,080
All right.

172
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,440
So let's take a break and listen to her dialogue one last time.

173
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,240
Almost three weeks.

174
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,919
I only have my clothes and camera.

175
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:17,960
Very well, sir.

176
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,659
Welcome to the United States.

177
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:20,840
Enjoy your visit.

178
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:25,480
All right.

179
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,799
So when you're arriving to immigration, obviously all these questions are very, very common.

180
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,000
You will be asked.

181
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:37,440
But when you're arriving there, there are actually two different sections that you have to go to.

182
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,779
Right.

183
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:38,299
That's right.

184
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,980
There's two different lines.

185
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,399
Maybe many lines, but they'll have a sign on top.

186
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,139
One says U.S.

187
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,460
passports or U.S.

188
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,379
passport holders.

189
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,519
And that means the line for Americans coming home to America.

190
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,879
But for most people who are traveling to America, they're foreigners.

191
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,620
They have to go to the other line.

192
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,840
So that's non U.S.

193
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:00,679
passport holders.

194
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,419
That's right.

195
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,899
Now, remember that you don't really have to get nervous when you're talking to the immigration officer.

196
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,379
You know, just have to take it easy and just try to answer the questions.

197
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:26,600
Most of them will speak a couple of words in many popular languages like Chinese or Spanish or Arabic, because obviously some people that go on holiday to the United States, maybe they don't speak English.

198
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:27,539
That's right.

199
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,919
So there's nothing to be worried about.

200
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,039
These people are there to make sure that America is safe.

201
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,500
They want to check the bags.

202
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,820
They want to know who's coming into the country.

203
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,480
And they're just doing their job being basically policing the borders.

204
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,919
Right.

205
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,539
But it's pretty simple.

206
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,879
The most annoying part of customs for me is waiting in line.

207
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,820
You have so many people arrive at the same time that you can wait in line maybe an hour sometimes.

208
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,399
Sometimes.

209
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,399
So again, just be honest and I think people will try to understand you if you're having a hard time.

210
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,000
Exactly.

211
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:03,139

213

Bye.

214
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:10,980
Bye.
